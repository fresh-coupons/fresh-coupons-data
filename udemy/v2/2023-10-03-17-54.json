He may also communicate this knowledge in a proper way, so that things are understandable for others. Soerin reviewed the thesis very detailed, by making comments in Word. The review notes will be clear and transparent. Soerin is very keen on the support of your written pieces with appropriate citations. He also helps to make your writing style \u0027journal proof\u0027. He gives examples (references to pieces from other papers) and make suggestions to improve your writing style. Soerin motivates others to \u201Cget the best out of yourself\u201D. Upon reviewing my thesis also noticed me that Soerin always reviewed with the why question. With this, he triggers another to think even more about the background of the texts are written. I\u2019am very positive about the contact times I had with Soerin, he shares his information with great passion, he is patient and takes his time to help you with questions or ambiguities. I don\u2019t have any improvement points for Soerin as thesis advisor. Again, I would recommend Soerin to anyone!\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJosina \u003Cbr\u003EMaster of Science in Accountancy\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#3\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022\u003Cem\u003EMy masterthesis (in Health Law) was recently reviewed by Soerin. While this thesis was outside his field, he provided me valuable feedback on the most crucial parts of my thesis, which were the main relevance between the\u0026nbsp;research question and subquestions, applied thesis methodology and theoretical structure in order to achieve consistency between title, problem, purpose and research questions. I\u2019ve also asked him to review my Final Conclusion \u0026amp; Recommendations. While his profession is in accountancy, his tips and key notes were very helpful and motivated me to finetune my thesis in some certain aspects such as re-production of my research findings and used theoretical literature. I think it is a real added value to let your thesis review by a professional teacher, who reviews dozens of master thesis a week. At the end I would really recommend anyone to let it reviewed by Soerin, which will motivate you to take the extra mile to finish your thesis on time\u003C/em\u003E\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJessica\u003Cbr\u003EMaster in Law\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#4\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022\u003Cem\u003EI hereby would like to recommend Soerin\u0026nbsp;as thesis supervisor / mentor in writing.\n\n Not for your ego but as a huge benefit for future students.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThe reason why I would recommend him is because I believe he sees\u0026nbsp;himself failing when a student fails.

For example: In my experience I was stuck in an analysis and he\u0026nbsp;did not tell me the answer, but showed me a door which made me think of how to deal with a hurdle.\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EImprovement can be accomplished on the areas of stopping a student when a student is only focussed on deadlines and less on quality of previous handed in parts of the thesis.

This library is a powerful object-oriented interface to the Tk GUI toolkit. In this course, you would get to know more about organizing and fitting widgets into the layout, basic transformations, creation of drop-down menu, shapes \u0026amp; graphics, intricacies of building login applications, and many other advanced GUI techniques. This will take you through different types of GUI interfaces and help in a detailed explanation of building a button in a GUI. we would create a windows application wherein we would first learn to set up the mainframe and then build on to that for creating a guest list page and a check-in page. Finally creating page having guest by room numbers and their receipts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPython GUI is one of the various toolkits present with Python and this toolkit focusses on developing GUI (Graphical User Interface). Now since python GUI is very specific to Python, let us look at what GUI essentially means, and then we may be able to jump into understanding specifically Python GUI. GUI or in other words, Graphical User Interface is a form of a connection tool through which users would be able to interact with electronic devices. This interaction is through the use of buttons and graphical icons which makes it visually appealing for users to use and the software behind the icons removes the robotic coding required to perform the particular task. The intention of the introduction of GUI is thought to reduce the commands that need to be typed at the command-line interface (CLI) through keyboard and that exactly what task it does!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow coming to Python GUI, let us say, for example, we would need to run a code in python, a .py file through the command line. We would create a simple GUI which might have a button \u201CRun\u201D and once a user clicks on that the python file which intends to run will automatically get selected and will run. What Python GUI would do essentially is remove the unnecessary coding part of running the python file through CLI. Not only this there are other plausible features Python GUI provides and that\u2019s exactly what you would go through in this course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring the training and post completion of the training, one would imbibe skills to take on more daring challenges in professional life. This course will also allow you to grasp the business intelligence required to be that handful of developers in Python GUI. This training will also give you a glimpse of the security concerns one faces in the real-world and, also allow you to think about how we can take care of those concerns. This Python GUI Course will also help you in getting the frame of mind to design the visual components and understand the temporal behavior of building the GUI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you complete the course you would b able to appreciate the enhancement of efficiency through the use of GUI, and the ease of use of the logical design of the program underlying in the design. With the completion of the course you would be able to bring in modularity in any GUI application you would build along with enhancing the usability perspective of GUI. This training is not restricted to just the theoretical part, but we enhance the use of theoretical concepts in the playground of real-life projects giving you an upper hand in establishing the relation of the concept and using them in real life. We ensure that no stone will be left unturned to make you the best python GUI developer organizations are looking for.

Let us start to understand what Minitab is. Minitab is a software used in use cases of statistics. Minitab, as the software is capable of data analysis, pattern detection through statistics, data crunching.

For this course specifically, we would be exploiting the use of Minitab for Time Series Analysis and Forecasting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, let us understand what time series analysis is. Time series data is a collection of data over some time or interval. The data when captured over time typically might have some internal structure, for example, autocorrelation, trends, seasonality, stationarity, and many such fundamentals. For example, let us think about the sales of umbrellas or raincoats. We can see that in the selling of these items we might encounter a seasonality aspect, that they might be sold high during the onset of the rainy season. Also, we can see that the data itself might auto-correlate itself to the promos that might have been set by some stores, online or offline, and many more such intricate detailing through the understanding of time series analysis fundamentals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow when we know how to analyze the time series it becomes pretty evident that what exactly to do with the studies or hypothesis we developed as a part of the study. The answer lies in prediction! We would understand the fundamentals through historical time series data and then utilize that deep insight to predict or forecast for the future. In this way, we would be able to capture the historical trends and seasonality and utilize them to have a better insight into what\u2019s in store in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis course is a collection of well-crafted tutorials or topics we would naturally go about if we must fully understand the topic of time series analysis and forecasting.
