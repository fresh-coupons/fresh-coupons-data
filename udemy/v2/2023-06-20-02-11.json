The World Wide Web Consortium\u0027s XML 1.0 Specification of 1998 and several other related specifications - all of them free open standards - define XML. The design goals of XML emphasize simplicity, generality, and usability across the Internet. It is a textual data format with strong support via Unicode for different human languages. Although the design of XML focuses on documents, the language is widely used for the representation of arbitrary data structures such as those used in web services. Several schema systems exist to aid in the definition of XML-based languages, while programmers have developed many application programming interfaces (APIs) to aid the processing of XML data.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u0022\u003Cstrong\u003EXSD\u003C/strong\u003E (\u003Cstrong\u003EXML Schema Definition\u003C/strong\u003E), a recommendation of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), specifies how to formally describe the elements in an Extensible Markup Language (XML) document. It can be used by programmers to verify each piece of item content in a document. They can check if it adheres to the description of the element it is placed in. Like all XML schema languages, XSD can be used to express a set of rules to which an XML document must conform in order to be considered \u0022valid\u0022 according to that schema. However, unlike most other schema languages, XSD was also designed with the intent that determination of a document\u0027s validity would produce a collection of information adhering to specific data types. Such a post-validation \u003Cem\u003Einfoset\u003C/em\u003E can be useful in the development of XML document processing software.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat you\u0027ll learn from this course:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E- You will learn all the theory about how to use XML language correctly, as well as all about its general and specific syntaxes, according to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) official recommendations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- You will learn all the practice about how to code your XML files, using the elements, attributes and types - default and custom ones - from the referred XSD schemas, as well as how to test the correctness and validation of your XML instances against their referred XSD docs using Eclipse IDE automation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- You will adventure into the complete theory background about how to create your own XSD schema documents and master the details about XSD general and specific syntaxes, according to W3C official specifications.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- You will practice, through tens of examples, how to code your own XSD files, using the 3 design methods suggested by W3C, as well as how to take advantage of all main base elements, attributes and types (default W3C library/namespace) to create your own personalized XML/XSD components.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- You will have pretty clear what default and custom namespaces are, as well as prefixes, both at the XML instances as at the XSD documents. You\u0027ll learn how to import and include multiple XSD documents into one same XSD and also how to refer to multiple XSD documents from one same XML instance, nice and easy... even using your own personal brand as the prefix for customizing your code (in my case: danielpm1982).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- All this course\u0027s theory, as well as the good practices and techniques used, are based on the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and W3Schools contents, here with much better and complete explanations and practical examples.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- After doing this course, you\u0027ll understand much easier all the document types used at Web Services development, or any other application that uses XML and XSD (or WSDL).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- All source codes are available at my GitHub, as well as attached to each practice lecture, as a zip file. You can easily download, study, reuse and test them yourself, for learning purposes, and even create much better examples. This is how you learn: starting from the basics and evolving, through practicing, until proficiency. All at your own pace and time and re-watching any lecture as many times as you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Additional content, as WSDL and JSON theory and practical lectures, as well as lectures with sample Web Services projects, demonstrating the real world applicability of XML, XSD, WSDL and JSON, will be added incrementally within the next months, at this same course. But you can finish this course with the current content, as it is, and receive your Udemy Certification on that\u2026 and if you want, you may return later, watch the future extra content lectures (WSDL and JSON) and, at the end, receive another Udemy Certification with the updated content and course name. All students will be notified when any future content is added.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- This course is already composed of more than 10 hours, a workload greater than almost all other same-topic courses at Udemy.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPrerequisites:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E- If you wanna practice, you should have Eclipse IDE installed on your PC or notebook. But you can just watch the theory and practical lectures, at any device with internet access, in case you have no computer available at that moment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- No programming languages or frameworks are required for this course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- No silly or useless tests will be imposed onto you. You will know you got the content right when you implement your own code and test it successfully, as done at our practical lectures. Simple as that and with no pressure!\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhom this course is for ?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E- Any human being who wishes to learn XML and XSD for future use in any of their many market applications, specially at, but not limited to, Web Services development.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat are the references of this course ?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E- The main reference source is the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which is the creator and worldwide maintainer of the specifications (REC) of XML language and related technologies (XSD, WSDL, etc). All related links, with W3C content, are attached to each theory lecture description.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat\u0027s the difference between taking this course and simply viewing W3Schools material at their own site ?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/strong\u003EAlthough the content is almost entirely referenced on W3C publications, this course offers much better, organized and understandable explanations about the content, and also a much greater set of examples, using Eclipse IDE, from the easiest to the most complex ones. At W3Schools site, for instance, you only find very simple snippets of code.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat\u0027s the difference between taking this course and the other XML/XSD courses at Udemy ?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E- No objection at all to those who may take more than one course. But this one has an innovative methodology, is more organized and complete (over 10 hours of theory and practices already), as well as it has much better examples, explained step by step, without any hurried 2-3 min lectures. It covers IN FULL everything that W3C suggests about XML and XSD.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- This course is organized similar to university or college lectures, with an average of 1h per lecture. The organization is oriented towards the content itself and not short time limited lectures. I think prioritizing the content on the curriculum organization contributes way better to cohesiveness as well as to the organization and consolidation of the content in anyone\u0027s brain. 2-3 min classes end up being a big confusion resulted from a too high fragmentation level of the content. Students always criticize on other courses that everything\u0027s too hastily delivered, as if the students already knew the subjects. Here, and differently from that, you\u0027ll see it\u0027s all nicely and easily delivered, and you won\u0027t get lost on the content, even if you never heard about XML or any structural or programming language before. You\u0027re free, though, to plan your own individual learning schedule. Just take note of the subject you last saw, and then continue from there when you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Finally, this course is divided into Theory and Practice lectures. You\u0027ll, thus, have multiple chances, from multiple explanation perspectives, to learn or complement the acknowledging of each topic, subtopics, practices, and so on. And, of course, at your own time, pace and individual needs. The access to this course will be forever yours (it doesn\u0027t expire) and you\u0027ll be able to review any lecture as much as you want. A big advantage of e-learning recorded lectures compared to live face-to-face attendance lectures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWelcome to the course !!

So we are not going deep into the theory and learn Java Platform from Scratch and very basics. Also we will not write code during this course, we will not going to have practical exercises. If you want to LEARN java from scratch - then you need to check my course Java from Zero to First Job which is best in the topic on Udemy already.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe current course is just for Interview Preparation, and it is more for Verifying your knowledge, and Remembering everything what you knew but forgot because of not using and need to be prepared for interview.

Do you feel the difference?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd now, let me explain who will find this course useful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis course is actually for both, for those who wants to pass the interview, and for those who is driving interview, so for technical interviewers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn case you are technical interviewer, and you don\u0027t have time to prepare questions, or come up with topics to discuss with potential candidate - then this course is for you. You have really a lot of questions on all possible Java related topics. You don\u0027t need to come up with your own questions.

This module will help you to understand the complex theory behind the Delta Wye transformer connection as I aim to build your strong concept through phasor diagrams. After this module you will be able to draw Delta Wye connection of transformer. By the end of this part, you will have a strong idea on voltage phasor diagram for delta connected transformer. In this module, different types of phasor diagram are compared with each other.

In this module, you will learn all the confusing theory of Wye Wye transformer connection from very scratch. This section will teach you how Wye connection is made on windings of transformer, what are different ways to configure Wye connection. To give you a better understanding of Wye Wye transformer connection, I discussed the difference of line and phase current in both windings of transformer. Furthermore, you will learn how voltage and current quantities are calculated in addition with the rules for balanced system, and how balanced sets are created by phasors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly, I will explain Circulating Currents and Voltages for Delta Wye connected transformer. Very simple power system is modelled as an example to calculate current and voltages during a faulted condition. For the practical model, you will learn how to calculate both phase and sequence current and voltages, how to relate sequence network diagram with hand-calculated short circuit currents. Furthermore, you will learn how current flows through the Delta Wye transformer connection.

There\u0027s the arcing current variation corrective factor that goes into a lot of detail, there is arc flash test, the continuous voltage spectrum, the enclosure size and correction factor, the table of equipment and class types, the minimum arcing current adjustments, and the 125 kVA transformer cutoff whatever happened to that, so we\u0027ll talk about that as well.

Practice alone is not enough to create portraits that come alive. That is the core value of this course. It provides a strong foundation for the individual to begin to master the creation of portraits of substance. This is not a course for the lazy. It requires patience and practice. But it will provide a roadmap that will allow the student to create fulfilling and satisfying portraits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u2013Stuart Givot\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn Excellent Course.

Chris\u0027s sense of art teaching is excellent, it\u0027s like hanging out in his studio, looking over his shoulder (literally sometimes) and learning from following a professional. He talks out loud what goes on in his thoughts as he mindfully works his image. Seeing him work really helps me. His own career is used as an example, and I love all the personal stories that talk about his journey in the art world and specifically in this field of drawing portraits. The course is full of gold nuggets of info, stories, metaphors that help me put words and structure in my work. (I love the \u0022Valley of the Suck\u0022\u003Cstrong\u003E \u003C/strong\u003Econcept\u2013so true! ) This course really helped me to clarify my work in regards to values. Also, it helps to come back to those foundations of the underlying structure of the face. I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to build a strong foundation and seriously wants to get into portrait art. As it is in my case, I would recommend it as well to any professional that wants to come back and touch those foundations again, one tends to forget stuff!

This is a full comprehensive course on prompt engineering for ChatGPT and AI text to image generator. As we all know, ChatGPT and generative AI have been growing very rapidly in the past couple months and prompt engineering definitely plays a very crucial role in maximising the quality of output generated by Chat GPT. Prompt engineering empowers users to shape the behaviour of Chat GPT, providing control, context, and customisation to the generated conversations. Those things are exactly what we are going to learn in this course. In the introduction session, you will learn the basic fundamentals of prompt engineering, understanding how it works, and technologies behind prompt engineering. Then, continuing by learning how to balance prompt specificity and generality since a prompt that is too specific will put limitations on ChatGPT creativity, however a prompt that is too general or broad will potentially cause ambiguity. Afterward, you will also get to know capabilities and limitations of ChatGPT, so you can set your expectations clearly and understand the output you can expect from ChatGPT. Then followed by learning the basic structure of ChatGPT prompt where you will extensively learn the formula of designing efficient prompt and continued by testing several ChatGPT prompt generator to automate and speed up more complex prompt creation using tools like FlowGPT, Fusion AI, and Hall Analysis where you automatically transform basic prompt to more complex prompt. Since relying on automation completely is not a wise decision to do, you are also going to learn techniques for framing questions and setting context in prompt manually and eventually compare their qualities with prompts generated by prompt generator. After making sure you understand all the basic concepts, we will enter the main part of the course where we will learn to write and design ChatGPT prompts for variety of topics or purposes, such as business, entrepreneurship, copywriting, marketing, programming, content creation, resume, cv, market research, learning languages, and email template. Once we are done with writing prompts for ChatGPT, we will move to prompt engineering for AI text to image generator where we will learn how to create and design effective prompts for Dall E and Leonardo AI text to image generator. Afterward, you are also going to be introduced to the latest AI technology that can help you a lot in producing high quality prompts and that is autonomous AI agent where you will learn how to utilise Agent GPT as your AI assistant to produce high quality prompts autonomously. Lastly, at the end of the course, you will also learn how you can potentially monetise your expertise in prompt engineering by selling your ChatGPT and AI text to image generator prompts on marketplaces like Etsy and Gumroad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, before getting into the course, we need to ask this question: Why learning prompt engineering is actually very important.
