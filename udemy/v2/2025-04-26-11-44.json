AI is a field of computer science that studies how to create machines that can process information, make decisions, and perform specific tasks.","The History of modern AI. The field of artificial intelligence (AI) has a long and rich history, dating back to the early days of computing. However, the field as we know it today was founded in 1956 at a conference at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire. This conference brought together the leading researchers in AI at the time, including Alan Turing, John McCarthy, and Marvin Minsky. The conference is credited with helping to define the field of AI and to set the agenda for future research.","Artificial Intelligence \u201CAI\u201D is a complex field that needs the ability of people from diverse disciplines to work together. As an example, manufacturing autonomous vehicles like self-driving cars requires the work of people from different fields, such as AI Researchers, Automotive Engineers, and Computer Vision Researchers.  AI Researchers develop algorithms that enable self-driving cars to perceive their surroundings, make decisions, and control their movements. Automotive Engineers develop the hardware and software systems that are needed to implement these algorithms, and Computer Vision Researchers develop new techniques for enabling self-driving cars to see and understand the world.","What is Machine Learning?
