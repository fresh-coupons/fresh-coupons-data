We cover a range of topics, starting from an introduction to cloud computing and cloud service models to cloud server deployment and configuration using Linode. We also explore the foundations of Linux, LAMP stack installation and configuration, server security, and SSL certificates.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe course begins with an introduction to cloud computing and the different service models available, such as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). This offers students a basic understanding of the different types of cloud services available along with various use cases.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ENext, the course delves into server deployment and configuration using Linode. Linode is a popular cloud hosting provider that offers a range of services, including virtual private servers (VPS), storage, and networking. Students will learn how to deploy and configure a virtual instance and use it to host a website or application using LAMP Stack. LAMP stands for Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP and is a popular stack used to build dynamic websites and web applications. Students will learn how to install and configure each component of the stack and use it to create a functional website or web application. The course will then cover Linux foundations, where we explore the Linux file system, basic commands, and user accounts.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn the following section students explore server security, including best practices for securing a server and common security threats. Students will learn about firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and how to secure sensitive data. We will demonstrate how to setup custom ports, hardware firewalls, and software firewalls using UFW.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EFinally, the course will cover installing and configuring SSL certificates. SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is a standard security technology for establishing an encrypted link between a web server and a browser. Students will learn how to obtain, install, and configure an SSL certificate to secure their website or web application.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThis course is well suited for anyone interested in cloud computing and server administration.

The focus of the course will be on four key services, including: Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), AWS Storage Solutions, and Elastic Load Balancers (ELB) integrated with Auto Scaling Groups (ASG). \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAmazon EC2 is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It allows users to launch virtual machines (VMs) on demand and pay only for the compute resources they use. In this course, we will explore the different types of instances available, as well as how to launch, configure, and manage EC2 instances.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn addition to the EC2 service, we also explore AWS storage solutions including Elastic Block Store (EBS), Elastic File System (EFS), Snapshots, and Amazon Machine Images (AMIs). EBS is a block-level storage service for use with EC2 instances. It provides persistent storage for data that needs to be frequently accessed. EFS is a file-level storage service for use with EC2 instances. It allows users to create and configure file systems that can be accessed from multiple instances. Snapshots are point-in-time copies of EBS volumes that can be used for backup and recovery. AMIs are pre-configured virtual machine images that can be used to launch EC2 instances. In this course, we will explore the different storage options available and how to use them to manage data on the AWS platform.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOnce students have a handle on the foundations, we explore more intermediate topics relevant to workload distribution through the integration of ELBs and ASGs. Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs) are used to distribute incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances. They automatically scale to handle incoming traffic and can also be used to improve availability and fault tolerance. In this course, we will explore the different types of load balancers available, as well as how to configure and use them to distribute traffic across multiple instances.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWe will demonstrate how to integrate the ELBs with Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs) to ensure workloads are only distributed to healthy nodes within the EC2 service. ASGs allow users to automatically scale the number of EC2 instances in response to changing demand. They automatically launch and terminate instances based on predefined rules, ensuring that the number of instances is always sufficient to handle incoming traffic. In this course, we will explore how to configure and use ASGs to automatically scale the number of instances on the AWS platform.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThroughout the course, we will use hands-on exercises to help students gain practical experience with the AWS platform. Students will have the opportunity to launch and configure EC2 instances, create and manage storage volumes, configure load balancers and auto scaling groups, and work with other AWS services.

We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E* Javascript Course Contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Introduction\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Array\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Variables\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Functions\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Objects\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Control Statements\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Cookies\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Loop statements\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Data Structures\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Error Handling\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Regular Expressions\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESee you inside the course\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-for-beginners-complete-course/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4200368_f71e_5.jpg","duration":"2 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"85,124.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["For Javascript  Programming Beginners","For People New to Javascript","For People Who want to learn Javascript Fundamentals and later Transition into Web Development"],"tags":["JavaScript"],"rating":{"count":944,"averageValue":"4.2"},"instructors":[{"name":"PROPER DOT INSTITUTE","url":"/user/vivek-dahibhate-2/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.2166667}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"C1BBA21E4517E1BE473D","originalPrice":"\u20B91,299","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/redis-database-tutorial/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4232132,"title":"Redis Database Tutorial","shortDescription":"redis commands for beginners","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EThe Redis database is a networked, in-memory, key-value database.

One way to think of this is as the capacity to react in a certain way when faced with a particular situation. This capability may be analyzed through three different lenses: intellectually, physiologically, and socially. Both individuals and groups of people may display human behavior, but in various ways depending on the context. The personality and actions of an individual are influenced, in part, by a variety of elements that are unique to that person, including both hereditary and environmental influences. Because a person\u0027s thoughts and emotions reflect aspects of their character such as their values and beliefs, a person\u0027s behavior is also influenced, at least in part, by these two factors. One may get insight into another person\u0027s mind by paying attention to their thoughts and feelings. Each individual has a one-of-a-kind personality, which in turn causes them to engage in one-of-a-kind actions and conduct themselves in one-of-a-kind ways. The psychological make-up of a person is what ultimately determines their conduct.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDeeds that are performed with the intention of promoting the health and happiness of other people are good examples of social behavior. In this area of study, some of the themes that are investigated include the major effect of social interaction and culture, ethics, interpersonal relationships, politics, and conflict. To be more precise, it is concerned in the role that social interaction and culture play in violent conflict and how they interact with one another. Certain actions are quite typical, but others are utterly uncharacteristic of the individual. The extent to which a certain conduct is seen as being socially acceptable is determined by social norms, and these standards are regulated through a wide range of mechanisms for the goal of preserving social order. People may be coerced into conforming to certain norms and displaying particular behaviors, which, depending on the community or culture to which they belong, are considered as acceptable or undesirable. This can happen whether or not the people in question are aware of the pressure they are under. The social pressure is something that may be exerted on humans. This is a direct consequence of social standards, which play an equal role in shaping conduct and are accountable for the same outcome.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/introduction-to-human-psychology-1st-edition/","imageUri":"https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5078270_4cd4.jpg","duration":"174 questions","enrolledStudentsCount":"199.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["These tests are suitable for everyone from all walks of life.","Online assignments and readings are available.","Students can study online, but we recommend that you attend classes whenever possible.","Attending online classes improves time management.

Psychologists study the connections that may be made between brain function and behavior, as well as the connections that can be made between behavior and the external world. They then put what they have learned to use in order to expand our understanding, so making the world a better place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Generally Accepted Scientific Procedure\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECuriosity is a characteristic that we all have by virtue of being human. When children are initially taught to ask questions, one of the first ones they are taught to ask is \u0022why?\u0022 Even if we are adults today, we will never stop being curious about things. Using empirical approaches, psychologists apply their universal interest to the process of data gathering and interpretation in research, with the ultimate objective of better grasping and addressing some of the most challenging challenges that contemporary society faces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is difficult, if not outright impossible, to think of a facet of life in which psychology does not play a part. There is no area of existence in which psychology does not play a role. The scientific method is something that psychologists employ. This process entails raising a question, offering an explanation for it, and then carrying out thorough experiments in the laboratory or out in the field to support the hypothesis. Psychologists use the information they\u0027ve gleaned from their studies and apply it to the creation of evidence-based practices that may assist in the resolution of problems and the improvement of people\u0027s lives.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ultimate effect of the discipline of psychology research is that it finds new and better ways that people may thrive in an environment that is becoming more complex while still surviving in that setting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Implementation of Scientific Principles\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are several subfields that fall under the umbrella of the subject of psychology. Psychologists do research that is both theoretical and applied, serve as consultants to various communities and organizations, diagnose and treat patients, and teach students who will go on to pursue careers in psychology as well as those who will go on to professions in other disciplines. In addition to judging one\u0027s character, they examine one\u0027s cerebral capabilities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are a significant number of psychologists who work in the medical profession as well. They assess not only the mental but also the behavioral functions, in addition to the health of the individual as a whole. Other subfields of psychology look at the dynamics of human interaction with one another and with technology, with the intention of improving these dynamics via their research.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe use of psychological research has the potential to minimize the financial toll that sickness has on governments and society by teaching people on how to make choices that are good to their own health and well-being. Students that have difficulty grasping new material are able to make better use of the improvements that have been made in educational assessment. It is helpful for educators to get an understanding of how children think, how they process information, and how they remember knowledge since this enables the creation of more effective educational techniques. The discipline of psychological science makes a contribution to the administration of justice by assisting legal authorities in gaining a better understanding of the minds of criminals, evidence, and the limitations of specific forms of testimony or evidence. This contribution is made possible thanks to the fact that psychological science is one of the fields that makes up the field of psychological science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe scientific study of the human mind and behavior is known as psychology.
