Merger: Two companies of relatively similar size combine forces to create a new, single entity. This is often a move for market expansion or gaining a competitive edge.  Acquisition: One company purchases a majority stake or all of another company. The acquiring company gains control of the acquired company\u0027s assets and operations. This can be done to enter new markets, eliminate competition, or gain new technology resources.","Key Pitfalls in M\u0026A  Culture Clash: Combining distinct company cultures can lead to employee conflicts, low morale, and a decline in productivity.  Overpaying: Enthusiasm can lead companies to overpay for an acquisition, resulting in financial losses down the line.  Poor Integration: Failure to smoothly integrate systems, processes, and teams creates operational chaos and hinders the potential of the combined entity.  Lack of Due Diligence: Insufficient research about the target company\u0027s financial health, legal standing, or market position might expose hidden liabilities and risks.  Loss of Focus: The complexity of the M\u0026A process can distract from core business operations, leading to neglected customers or missed opportunities.","Why is Learning About M\u0026A Important for Companies and Managers?  Strategic Growth: M\u0026A can be a powerful tool to expand into new markets, acquire new technologies, eliminate competitors, or increase market share significantly.  Responding to Market Changes Companies must adapt to industry shifts. An M\u0026A strategy can be vital for staying ahead of the competition or even surviving.  Leadership Development: M\u0026A success relies heavily on the ability of managers to navigate complexity, integrate teams, and make crucial decisions under pressure.","How Can M\u0026A Skills Support Career Development?  Increased Demand: As M\u0026A activity continues to be prevalent, professionals with these skills are highly sought after by companies, investment banks, and consulting firms.  Leadership Opportunities: M\u0026A skills signal strategic thinking, problem-solving abilities, and a talent for execution \u2013 all assets for leadership roles.  Broader Skillset: M\u0026A involves exposure to various aspects of business such as finance, valuation, negotiation, and legal, thus developing a more versatile skillset.

The World Wide Web Consortium\u0027s XML 1.0 Specification of 1998 and several other related specifications - all of them free open standards - define XML. The design goals of XML emphasize simplicity, generality, and usability across the Internet. It is a textual data format with strong support via Unicode for different human languages. Although the design of XML focuses on documents, the language is widely used for the representation of arbitrary data structures such as those used in web services. Several schema systems exist to aid in the definition of XML-based languages, while programmers have developed many application programming interfaces (APIs) to aid the processing of XML data.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u0022\u003Cstrong\u003EXSD\u003C/strong\u003E (\u003Cstrong\u003EXML Schema Definition\u003C/strong\u003E), a recommendation of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), specifies how to formally describe the elements in an Extensible Markup Language (XML) document. It can be used by programmers to verify each piece of item content in a document. They can check if it adheres to the description of the element it is placed in. Like all XML schema languages, XSD can be used to express a set of rules to which an XML document must conform in order to be considered \u0022valid\u0022 according to that schema. However, unlike most other schema languages, XSD was also designed with the intent that determination of a document\u0027s validity would produce a collection of information adhering to specific data types. Such a post-validation \u003Cem\u003Einfoset\u003C/em\u003E can be useful in the development of XML document processing software.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat you\u0027ll learn from this course:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E- You will learn all the theory about how to use XML language correctly, as well as all about its general and specific syntaxes, according to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) official recommendations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- You will learn all the practice about how to code your XML files, using the elements, attributes and types - default and custom ones - from the referred XSD schemas, as well as how to test the correctness and validation of your XML instances against their referred XSD docs using Eclipse IDE automation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- You will adventure into the complete theory background about how to create your own XSD schema documents and master the details about XSD general and specific syntaxes, according to W3C official specifications.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- You will practice, through tens of examples, how to code your own XSD files, using the 3 design methods suggested by W3C, as well as how to take advantage of all main base elements, attributes and types (default W3C library/namespace) to create your own personalized XML/XSD components.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- You will have pretty clear what default and custom namespaces are, as well as prefixes, both at the XML instances as at the XSD documents. You\u0027ll learn how to import and include multiple XSD documents into one same XSD and also how to refer to multiple XSD documents from one same XML instance, nice and easy... even using your own personal brand as the prefix for customizing your code (in my case: danielpm1982).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- All this course\u0027s theory, as well as the good practices and techniques used, are based on the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and W3Schools contents, here with much better and complete explanations and practical examples.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- After doing this course, you\u0027ll understand much easier all the document types used at Web Services development, or any other application that uses XML and XSD (or WSDL).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- All source codes are available at my GitHub, as well as attached to each practice lecture, as a zip file. You can easily download, study, reuse and test them yourself, for learning purposes, and even create much better examples. This is how you learn: starting from the basics and evolving, through practicing, until proficiency. All at your own pace and time and re-watching any lecture as many times as you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Additional content, as WSDL and JSON theory and practical lectures, as well as lectures with sample Web Services projects, demonstrating the real world applicability of XML, XSD, WSDL and JSON, will be added incrementally within the next months, at this same course. But you can finish this course with the current content, as it is, and receive your Udemy Certification on that\u2026 and if you want, you may return later, watch the future extra content lectures (WSDL and JSON) and, at the end, receive another Udemy Certification with the updated content and course name. All students will be notified when any future content is added.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- This course is already composed of more than 10 hours, a workload greater than almost all other same-topic courses at Udemy.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPrerequisites:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E- If you wanna practice, you should have Eclipse IDE installed on your PC or notebook. But you can just watch the theory and practical lectures, at any device with internet access, in case you have no computer available at that moment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- No programming languages or frameworks are required for this course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- No silly or useless tests will be imposed onto you. You will know you got the content right when you implement your own code and test it successfully, as done at our practical lectures. Simple as that and with no pressure!\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhom this course is for ?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E- Any human being who wishes to learn XML and XSD for future use in any of their many market applications, specially at, but not limited to, Web Services development.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat are the references of this course ?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E- The main reference source is the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which is the creator and worldwide maintainer of the specifications (REC) of XML language and related technologies (XSD, WSDL, etc). All related links, with W3C content, are attached to each theory lecture description.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat\u0027s the difference between taking this course and simply viewing W3Schools material at their own site ?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/strong\u003EAlthough the content is almost entirely referenced on W3C publications, this course offers much better, organized and understandable explanations about the content, and also a much greater set of examples, using Eclipse IDE, from the easiest to the most complex ones. At W3Schools site, for instance, you only find very simple snippets of code.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat\u0027s the difference between taking this course and the other XML/XSD courses at Udemy ?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E- No objection at all to those who may take more than one course. But this one has an innovative methodology, is more organized and complete (over 10 hours of theory and practices already), as well as it has much better examples, explained step by step, without any hurried 2-3 min lectures. It covers IN FULL everything that W3C suggests about XML and XSD.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- This course is organized similar to university or college lectures, with an average of 1h per lecture. The organization is oriented towards the content itself and not short time limited lectures. I think prioritizing the content on the curriculum organization contributes way better to cohesiveness as well as to the organization and consolidation of the content in anyone\u0027s brain. 2-3 min classes end up being a big confusion resulted from a too high fragmentation level of the content. Students always criticize on other courses that everything\u0027s too hastily delivered, as if the students already knew the subjects. Here, and differently from that, you\u0027ll see it\u0027s all nicely and easily delivered, and you won\u0027t get lost on the content, even if you never heard about XML or any structural or programming language before. You\u0027re free, though, to plan your own individual learning schedule. Just take note of the subject you last saw, and then continue from there when you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Finally, this course is divided into Theory and Practice lectures. You\u0027ll, thus, have multiple chances, from multiple explanation perspectives, to learn or complement the acknowledging of each topic, subtopics, practices, and so on. And, of course, at your own time, pace and individual needs. The access to this course will be forever yours (it doesn\u0027t expire) and you\u0027ll be able to review any lecture as much as you want. A big advantage of e-learning recorded lectures compared to live face-to-face attendance lectures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWelcome to the course !!

Conventionally, it pertains to the risk arising from lenders\u2019 inability to return the owed interest and principal, impacting the cash flows and increasing assemblage costs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen any lender extends loans such as mortgages, credit cards, or other similar loans, there is an avoidable risk that the borrower will not repay the loan amounts. Furthermore, if a company offers such credit to the customer, there\u2019s the same risk that the customer will not pay back. It also incorporates other related risks, such as that the bond issuer may not make payment at the time of maturity and the risk occurring out of the incapacity of the insurance company to compensate for the claim. A higher level of credit risk in a profitable market will correlate with the elevated borrowing cost. Because of this, it is evaluated technically to mitigate such risk to a certain level.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe will start with a brief introduction to measures of credit risk modeling. Understanding the credit risk and how it is being measured is important before we into the meat of the module. Then, we will talk about traditional credit models in length. And in the next section, we will give you practical examples of traditional credit models. In the same section, we will also talk about the structural model of credit risk. Since understanding the theory isn\u2019t enough, we will also take an example of the structural model of credit risk. Next, we will teach you Altman Z-score. In this section, you will learn about Altman Z-score and how you can calculate the Z-score. Then, we will talk about the Z-score of the airline industry. And then, we will also take a practical example of the US airline industry and discuss the airline industry Z-score. Then, under the same section, we will talk about the credit rating description of the airlines. Now, we will directly go into credit analysis. Under credit analysis, you will learn credit modeling, the evaluation metric in credit modeling, and also the early warning checklist in credit modeling. Then, we will teach you UFCE and WC Credit Modeling. Next, we will look at the financial statement analysis (the income statement, the balance sheet, the cash flow statement) in detail. Finally, we will talk about ways out analysis and internal ratings. In the end, we will show you the reference files to end the module.

A successful manager is now expected to act as a leader, a mentor, and a coach, guiding their team members towards individual and collective success. This paradigm shift highlights the significance of coaching techniques in the realm of managerial responsibilities.","The Transformation of Managerial Roles  Evolving Leadership Expectations  The traditional image of a manager as a stern authority figure has given way to a more holistic view of leadership. Managers are now expected to serve as role models, motivators, and mentors to their teams. This shift stems from the recognition that employees perform at their best when they feel valued, supported, and empowered.  The evolution of leadership expectations can be traced back to the changing dynamics of the modern workplace. In the past, managers were primarily responsible for enforcing rules and ensuring productivity. However, as organizations began to realize that employee engagement and satisfaction were crucial for success, a transformation in managerial roles ensued.  Today, managers are not just tasked with overseeing tasks and projects; they are expected to inspire and empower their teams. This shift is partly a response to the changing nature of work itself. In a knowledge-based economy, where creativity, innovation, and adaptability are paramount, traditional top-down management no longer suffices.","Coaching as a Leadership Skill  Coaching has emerged as a pivotal leadership skill that fosters personal and professional growth. We\u0027ll explore how coaching techniques, such as active listening, constructive feedback, and goal-setting, can empower managers to become effective leaders who inspire and guide their teams towards excellence.  Coaching is not a one-size-fits-all approach; it is a dynamic and personalized method of leadership. Effective coaches adapt their style to the needs and preferences of individual team members. They actively listen to understand the unique challenges and aspirations of each employee, fostering a sense of trust and rapport.  Moreover, coaching is not merely about providing solutions but guiding employees to discover answers themselves. This approach instills a sense of ownership and accountability in team members. It encourages them to take the initiative, think critically, and develop problem-solving skills\u2014a valuable asset in today\u0027s fast-paced, ever-changing business landscape.  Coaching also plays a crucial role in setting and achieving goals. Effective managers use coaching techniques to collaboratively define clear, actionable objectives with their team members. This process not only aligns individual efforts with organizational goals but also empowers employees to track their progress and make necessary adjustments along the way.","Coaching Knowledge for Career Development  Career Development in the Modern Workplace  Career development is a top priority for employees. Discover how coaching knowledge equips managers with the tools to help team members navigate their career paths, set meaningful goals, and continually improve their skills.  Career development has evolved from being a peripheral concern to a central focus in the modern workplace. In an era marked by rapid technological advancements and industry disruptions, employees recognize the importance of continuous learning and skill enhancement to remain relevant and competitive.  This heightened emphasis on career development places managers at the forefront of helping their team members chart their professional journeys. Coaching knowledge equips managers with the ability to provide guidance that is not only aligned with the organization\u0027s needs but also tailored to the aspirations of individual employees.  One of the key advantages of coaching in career development is its ability to facilitate self-awareness. Effective coaches help employees identify their strengths, weaknesses, interests, and values. Armed with this self-knowledge, employees can make informed career decisions that align with their passions and long-term goals.","The Manager as a Career Development Partner  Explore the responsibilities of middle and top managers in preparing and mentoring personal development plans for their team members. Learn how these plans can align with organizational objectives and create a win-win situation for both employees and the company.  Managers who actively engage in career development become indispensable partners in their employees\u0027 professional growth. They play a pivotal role in creating personalized development plans that leverage individual strengths and address areas needing improvement.  These development plans not only benefit the employees but also the organization. By aligning individual development goals with the company\u0027s strategic objectives, managers ensure that every team member\u0027s growth contributes to the overall success of the business.  Furthermore, coaching techniques are instrumental in fostering a growth mindset within teams. Managers can use coaching to encourage employees to embrace challenges, persist in the face of setbacks, and view failures as opportunities for learning and improvement.

Course for any who want to build a career at Web3 or improve their knowledge.","Web3 refers to the next generation of the internet, often referred to as the decentralized web. It is envisioned as a more transparent, secure, and user-centric version of the internet, enabled by blockchain technology and decentralized protocols. In Web3, users have more control over their data and digital identities, and intermediaries such as centralized platforms are minimized or eliminated. This decentralized architecture offers various benefits such as increased privacy, censorship resistance, and the ability to create trustless interactions through smart contracts.","NFT stands for Non-Fungible Token. NFTs are unique digital assets that represent ownership or proof of authenticity of a particular item or piece of content, typically stored on a blockchain. Unlike cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, which are fungible and can be exchanged on a one-to-one basis, NFTs are indivisible and cannot be exchanged on a like-for-like basis due to their unique attributes. NFTs have gained significant attention in recent years, especially in the realms of digital art, collectibles, gaming, and virtual real estate, as they provide a way to establish scarcity and ownership in the digital world.","Learning about Web3 and NFTs is important for companies and managers for several reasons:  Understanding Emerging Technologies: Web3 and NFTs represent significant shifts in how we interact with the internet and digital assets. By staying informed about these technologies, companies and managers can anticipate trends and adapt their strategies accordingly.  New Business Opportunities: Web3 and NFTs open up new avenues for innovation and revenue generation. Companies that embrace these technologies can explore novel business models, such as decentralized finance (DeFi), tokenized assets, and digital collectibles.  Enhanced Customer Engagement: NFTs enable unique and personalized experiences for customers, whether through digital art, exclusive content, or virtual goods. By leveraging NFTs, companies can deepen customer engagement and foster a sense of community around their brand.","Mitigating Risks: As blockchain technology becomes more prevalent, understanding its implications becomes crucial for risk management. Companies need to grasp the security and regulatory considerations associated with Web3 and NFTs to protect their assets and reputation.  Developing skills in Web3 and NFTs can support career advancement or the launch of a business in several ways:  Technical Proficiency: Learning blockchain development, smart contract programming, and NFT standards (such as ERC-721 or ERC-1155) can open up opportunities for technical roles in blockchain-focused companies or projects.","Entrepreneurial Ventures: Individuals with expertise in Web3 and NFTs can capitalize on the growing demand for blockchain-based solutions by starting their own businesses. This could involve creating NFT marketplaces, developing blockchain games, or providing consultancy services to companies exploring blockchain integration.  Strategic Leadership: Managers who understand the potential of Web3 and NFTs can drive innovation within their organizations and guide strategic decisions related to blockchain adoption. This may involve identifying use cases, forming partnerships with blockchain startups, or implementing pilot projects to test new ideas.  Personal Branding: Building a reputation as a thought leader or expert in Web3 and NFTs can enhance career prospects and attract opportunities for speaking engagements, advisory roles, or partnerships.  In conclusion, learning about Web3 and NFTs is essential for companies and managers to stay competitive in a rapidly evolving digital landscape. By embracing these technologies and developing relevant skills, individuals can position themselves for career growth and entrepreneurial success in the blockchain industry."],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":8,"averageValue":"4.2"},"instructors":[{"name":"MTF Institute of Management, Technology and Finance","url":"/user/mtfinstitute/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.0625}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"9558132040A9F9F0808F","originalPrice":"\u20B93,499","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/professional-diploma-of-real-estate-business-expert/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5871066,"title":"Professional Diploma of Real Estate Business Expert","shortDescription":"Professional Diploma of Real Estate Business Expert by MTF Institute","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWelcome to course\u003C/strong\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003EProfessional Diploma of Real Estate Business Expert by MTF Institute\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECourse provided by \u003Cstrong\u003EMTF Institute of Management, Technology and Finance\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMTF\u003C/strong\u003E is the global educational and research institute with HQ at Lisbon, Portugal, focused on business \u0026amp; professional hybrid (on-campus and online) education at areas: Business \u0026amp; Administration, Science \u0026amp; Technology, Banking \u0026amp; Finance. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMTF R\u0026amp;D \u003C/strong\u003Ecenter focused on research activities at areas: Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Data Science, Big Data, WEB3, Blockchain, Cryptocurrency \u0026amp; Digital Assets, Metaverses, Digital Transformation, Fintech, Electronic Commerce, Internet of Things. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMTF\u003C/strong\u003E is the official partner of: IBM, Intel, Microsoft, member of the Portuguese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and resident of the incubator \u0022The Fintech House of Portugal\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMTF \u003C/strong\u003Eis present in 208 countries and has been chosen by more than 380,000 students.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECourse Author: Igor Dmitriev\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMortgage and Real Estate Ecosystems Expert and ex Head of Business line at Societe Generale Global banking group\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDigital Transformation and Banking Expert\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEducation:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMBA, The Boston University\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster of Science at Engineering (Technical) Management,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe State University of New York at Buffalo\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster of Science at Informatics and Economics,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESix Sigma Black Belt\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EExperience:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExpert at Banking (\u0026gt; 18 years), FinTech \u0026amp; Digital (\u0026gt; 15 years),\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExperienced Manager (\u0026gt; 14 years) with successful track of records\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eat personal and corporate entrepreneurship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore than 12 years at worldwide banking groups such us\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESociete Generale , Raiffeisenbank\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExperience at roles: CEO, Head of Business, Chief Digital \u0026amp;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMarketing Officer, Head of Digital Transformation and Channels, Head of Products and Marketing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat is the Real Estate Business?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe real estate business encompasses all activities related to the buying, selling, renting, development, and management of land and buildings.

It is envisioned as a more transparent, secure, and user-centric version of the internet, enabled by blockchain technology and decentralized protocols. In Web3, users have more control over their data and digital identities, and intermediaries such as centralized platforms are minimized or eliminated. This decentralized architecture offers various benefits such as increased privacy, censorship resistance, and the ability to create trustless interactions through smart contracts.","NFT stands for Non-Fungible Token. NFTs are unique digital assets that represent ownership or proof of authenticity of a particular item or piece of content, typically stored on a blockchain. Unlike cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, which are fungible and can be exchanged on a one-to-one basis, NFTs are indivisible and cannot be exchanged on a like-for-like basis due to their unique attributes.

What can lead to sudden rating change\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECreditors use a credit score rating scale to assess an individual\u2019s creditworthiness, i.e., a person\u2019s likelihood of whether the company can pay the debt obligation fully on time. Different credit rating agencies provide credit ratings. A rating is given to any issuer, i.e., an individual, corporate, state, or sovereign government seeking to borrow the money. The rating does not say whether an investor should really buy that bond, but it is just one of the most important parameters an investor should consider before investing in any bond. A rating suggests both the present situation and the impact of future events on credit risk. Credit ratings are not constant. They keep changing from time to time as the credit quality of an issue or issuer alters in ways that were not expected when a rating was assigned. For example, consider a new technology that was not expected, which was not considered while assigning a rating to a company. This new technology might lead to a negative impact on the financials of the company. This may impact the downgrading of the current rating. \u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/credit-ratings-of-banks-beginners-course/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5773564_6915.jpg","duration":"43 total mins","enrolledStudentsCount":"1,874.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Financial Risk Managers, Credit Managers/Credit Analyst, Credit Portfolio Managers, Asset Managers, Investment professionals, Students who want to pursue their career in any of the above fields"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":0,"averageValue":"0.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"EDUCBA Bridging the Gap","url":"/user/premananda-suna/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":0}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"EDUCBA7221912","originalPrice":"\u20B93,499","discountedPrice":"\u20B9449","expirationText":"5 hours","discountPercentage":87}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/finite-element-analysis-solidworks-simulation-p2-contacts/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5677452,"title":"Finite Element Analysis.
