The tutor has used real-world mechanical engineering projects as an example in this video course. This enables the user to relate the tutorials to real-world models in the mechanical engineering industry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe subject of interpretability offered by Creo Parametric includes receiving legacy data from other CAD systems and from its own product data management modules. The real benefit of Creo Parametric is that the links remain associative. As a result, any change made to this external data gets notified and the model can be updated quickly. The videos in Creo Parametric further elaborates on the procedure of generating the drawings of a model or assembly, which are used for documentation of a model or assembly. \u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-course-in-creo-parametric/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4768822_5a6f_2.jpg","duration":"7 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"9,677.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Engineers, Product Designers, Diploma Holders, Undergraduates and school students."],"tags":["Product Design"],"rating":{"count":87,"averageValue":"4.3"},"instructors":[{"name":"CADCIM Technologies","url":"/user/cadcim-technologies/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.33}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"CREO_COMP1","originalPrice":"\u20B92,529","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/concentration-ultime/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5941852,"title":"Efficacit\u00E9 et Concentration pour R\u00C9SULTATS EXTR\u00CAMES","shortDescription":"M\u00E9thode d\u0027hacks d\u2019efficacit\u00E9 pour se cr\u00E9er des instants d\u0027immersion et obtenir une concentration extr\u00EAme","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003ELa m\u00E9thode \u00AB\u0026nbsp;\u003Cstrong\u003EConcentration Ultime\u003C/strong\u003E\u0026nbsp;\u00BB que vous vous appr\u00EAtez \u00E0 suivre est un cours unique con\u00E7u pour vous aider \u00E0 maximiser votre productivit\u00E9 et votre \u00E9panouissement personnel.

We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables.
