Did you know that our brain is capable of holding information longer and wider than our lives? That we can possibly know so much that for now we can\u2019t even imagine that happening? That\u2019s because we have to use our brain\u2019s potential and unveil everything it hides.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe will also learn about neurogenesis through our lives.

The focus of the course will be on four key services, including: Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), AWS Storage Solutions, and Elastic Load Balancers (ELB) integrated with Auto Scaling Groups (ASG). \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAmazon EC2 is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It allows users to launch virtual machines (VMs) on demand and pay only for the compute resources they use. In this course, we will explore the different types of instances available, as well as how to launch, configure, and manage EC2 instances.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn addition to the EC2 service, we also explore AWS storage solutions including Elastic Block Store (EBS), Elastic File System (EFS), Snapshots, and Amazon Machine Images (AMIs). EBS is a block-level storage service for use with EC2 instances. It provides persistent storage for data that needs to be frequently accessed. EFS is a file-level storage service for use with EC2 instances. It allows users to create and configure file systems that can be accessed from multiple instances. Snapshots are point-in-time copies of EBS volumes that can be used for backup and recovery. AMIs are pre-configured virtual machine images that can be used to launch EC2 instances. In this course, we will explore the different storage options available and how to use them to manage data on the AWS platform.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOnce students have a handle on the foundations, we explore more intermediate topics relevant to workload distribution through the integration of ELBs and ASGs. Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs) are used to distribute incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances. They automatically scale to handle incoming traffic and can also be used to improve availability and fault tolerance. In this course, we will explore the different types of load balancers available, as well as how to configure and use them to distribute traffic across multiple instances.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWe will demonstrate how to integrate the ELBs with Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs) to ensure workloads are only distributed to healthy nodes within the EC2 service. ASGs allow users to automatically scale the number of EC2 instances in response to changing demand. They automatically launch and terminate instances based on predefined rules, ensuring that the number of instances is always sufficient to handle incoming traffic. In this course, we will explore how to configure and use ASGs to automatically scale the number of instances on the AWS platform.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThroughout the course, we will use hands-on exercises to help students gain practical experience with the AWS platform. Students will have the opportunity to launch and configure EC2 instances, create and manage storage volumes, configure load balancers and auto scaling groups, and work with other AWS services. By the end of the course, students will have a solid understanding of the AWS platform and will be able to use it to build scalable and reliable cloud-based applications.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-elastic-load-balancing-with-auto-scaling-groups/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4925158_0612.jpg","duration":"8 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"7,097.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Students interested in learning the foundations of AWS","Students interested in Cloud Computing","Students interested in exploring the Amazon EC2 Service","Students interested in exploring various EC2 Storage Solutions (EFS, EBS)","Students interested in setting up Highly Available cloud setups using ELBs, and ASGs on AWS"],"tags":["Cloud Computing","Amazon Elastic Block Store","AWS Elastic Load Balancing"],"rating":{"count":33,"averageValue":"4.4"},"instructors":[{"name":"YouAccel Training","url":"/user/youaccel/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.467742}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"YOUACCEL97668","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"2 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/install-nginx-php-mysql-ssl-wordpress-on-ubuntu/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":1844490,"title":"Install NGINX, PHP, MySQL, SSL \u0026 WordPress on Ubuntu","shortDescription":"Learn to Install \u0026 Configure NGINX on Ubuntu 18.04.

This method is used in the study of human behavior. It is often carried out in a laboratory and employs methods that are comparable to those that are used in the domains of physics, chemistry, or biology. The most significant difference is that rather than analyzing light rays, chemical processes, or insects, we will all be taking part in the experiments ourselves, together with other people. This will be the case rather than researching any of those things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EResearch in social psychology typically focuses on how people behave in real-world settings, such as how people react to commercials, why individuals commit crimes, and how we might improve productivity in professional settings such as workplaces and factories. For example, how people react to commercials; why individuals commit crimes; and how we might improve productivity in professional settings. For instance, how people react to ads, why people commit crimes, and how we may enhance efficiency in professional settings are some of the topics that can be discussed. Experiments aren\u0027t always necessary in order to study social psychology; sometimes, rather of depending on experiments, researchers will sometimes rely on questionnaires or observations. Experiments aren\u0027t always required in order to study social psychology.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe division I\u0027ve made between experimental and social psychology is both arbitrary and artificial, but it does reflect the way psychology is typically taught in schools and colleges, as well as how it\u0027s written up in textbooks and scientific papers. In other words, it\u0027s a reflection of how psychology is typically practiced. I\u0027ve decided that experimental psychology falls within the umbrella of social psychology as a discipline. Naturally, controlled experiments may be carried out in a laboratory as part of the study of social psychology, just as controlled experiments can be carried out out in the real world. The very short history of the field is the single most crucial aspect to consider while attempting to comprehend why this is the situation. In the latter half of the 19th century, when psychology was still in its infancy as a scientific field, psychologists were eager to be considered seriously in their professional capacity. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou will find more details in this course.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/introduction-to-human-psychology-2nd-edition/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5037924_8212_2.jpg","duration":"1.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"519.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["This course for everyone who wants to learn human psychology details.","Online assignments and readings are available.","Students can study online, but we recommend that you attend classes whenever possible.","Attending online classes improves time management.
