The course starts right from the basics, where we explore various cloud computing service models. This includes infrastructure as a service, platform as a service, and software as a service. From there students gain hands-on experience with creating and administering remote virtual instances, complete with Ubuntu, Apache, MariaDB, and PHP. Students will learn the difference between popular web servers like Apache and NGINX, along with a detailed overview of various database management systems. This includes both SQL and NoSQL databases, in addition to database transaction standards such as ACID and CAP Theorem. In addition to a theoretical deep dive, the course demonstrates how to install, configure, and secure LAMP stack on Ubuntu for hosting dynamic, database driven web apps. We offer a detailed segment on server security, where students will configure both software and network firewalls for their instance using strict firewall policies, UFW and custom SSH ports. At this stage students will also learn to scale their servers both vertically and horizontally using application load balancers. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe second half of the course provides a comprehensive guide to Amazon Web Services. We start with demonstrating how to setup, secure, and navigate an AWS account. This includes setting up billing alerts and multi-factor authentication. From there, we take a deep dive into AWS Identity and Access management for enhanced account security, and the management of user accounts for various AWS services.

This course teaches you the fundamentals of Six Sigma. It not just helps with change management within your company but also helps your organization to prepare for the new normal. Customer expectations or demands are constantly changing in this world governed by technology. Six Sigma\u0027s emphasis on customer satisfaction enables the company to produce higher-quality products and increase customer loyalty over time. A product-focused strategy compares the product to the products of competitors in order to reach or slightly exceed such levels. You must know that Six Sigma focuses on minimising process variation and improving process control, whereas lean encourages work standardisation and flow by eliminating waste (non-value added processes and procedures).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease note that to achieve success leveraging the Six Sigma methodology, organisational processes must have a failure rate of no more than 3.4 per million (99.99966%) chances. A Six Sigma defect is anything that isn\u0027t according to the client\u0027s specifications. Its goal is to reduce the amount of variation in commercial and production operations. The capacity to focus on producing quantitative and measurable financial gains from any Six Sigma project is one of the most notable features. Employees can identify problem areas as well as reoccurring difficulties that affect the overall quality expectation of a service or product from a customer\u0027s perspective using Six Sigma methodology.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy opt for this course - the proven game-changer?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy completing this\u003Cstrong\u003E \u0022Lean Six Sigma White Belt Online Course\u0022\u003C/strong\u003E, you will gain the basic understanding of what Lean Six Sigma is and how Lean Six Sigma brings a plethora of benefits to your organization.\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are a professional individual who wants to grow and sustain in this ever-changing competitive world (where speed is no longer just a good to have criteria) and want to discover a way to fit in the new norms with their employees - this course is for you to learn and master!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThis mind-blowing White belt course will walk you through unbelievable insights and learning that you don\u0027t want to miss at all as a newbie entering the world of Lean Six Sigma.\u0026nbsp;What\u0027s more?

Long before the pandemic, the mix of fitness technology and digital fitness was altering our market; both areas were rising at a rapid pace. This transition affects both consumers (gym goers) and suppliers (gyms/personal trainers) now more than ever before. Fitness businesses and members alike have invested in home new-age fitness equipment - and the fitness industry has shifted online to survive: gyms have improved their online offerings, and members have improved their home set-ups, investing in a variety of equipment, apps, wearables, and fitness trackers for the long-term. The use of social media in gym marketing has become a must. It\u0027s a channel via which people can quickly obtain information. They can provide gym-specific advice or information, thereby educating followers on health and wellness and boosting the active-living trend. Owners are rewarded with useful comments, allowing them to establish a solid business reputation, increase member trust, and attract new potential consumers by mentioning their brand online. People are too communicating with each other online in greater numbers than ever before. They follow an influencer on Instagram, subscribe to a fitness channel on YouTube, join a fitness group on Facebook, and like a friend\u0027s Instagram post about weight reduction success. Gyms are starting to recognise the social component of fitness by making it look that fitness is less about attending the gym and more about living a healthy lifestyle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fitness industry has had to conform to a new normal; future gyms will be hybrid and virtual reality, and gym members will track their progress and exercise both in and out of the gym even digitally!!

They can also create goals and track their progress over time by digging deeper into the tracker\u0027s dashboard. There are plenty of virtual reality programmes nowadays too, you can use to burn calories, but just a few are exclusively focused on exercise right now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApps for fitness have never been more important. Fitness app downloads are bound to increase by about 50% in the first half of every year, according to the World Economic Forum.

The answer can already be found in the first sentence. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAudio social media systems appear to fulfil a long-held goal for free and democratic social media. Decentralisation offers a wide range of applications, from cryptocurrency to social media. Unlike podcasts or livestreams, social audio platforms are more of an open conversation than a monologue. Even if you\u0027re in a chatroom full of strangers, group voice chats feel strangely intimate. Audio social media platforms allow users a more democratic option to get their opinion heard in a world where platforms are becoming pay-to-play. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBrands may be able to test audio-based ad formats on audio social networks at some point in the future.

Individual chat rooms would most likely have audio advertising \u2014 a company representative or host would provide a short commercial at the start, middle, and/or end of a conversation. Social audio platforms tend to draw niche audiences, ranging from astrology enthusiasts to side hustlers, providing the ideal opportunity for companies to get in front of their target audience in an audio format. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAccessibility is critical to the development of social media. Some apps or software as we know it are inaccessible to persons who are deaf or hard of hearing due to their audio-only nature. Discord has added certain accessibility features, including text-to-speech and greater screen-reader integration, in response to similar criticisms. Audio platforms must ensure that their platform is accessible to everyone in order to survive. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne way audio platforms keep users interested is through attracting influencers and celebrities who funnel their audience from other media.

PyTest is a key component in the work of many software development teams, quality assurance teams, independent testing companies and from students on their university projects. Many platforms are now switching from the legacy unitest to Pytest to test their code. This is because Pytest offers powerful features such as rewrite validation, a third-party attachment model, and a powerful yet simple device adaptation this is unmatched in any other testing framework. Pytest is a software testing framework, which means that Pytest is a command line tool that automatically finds tests you\u0027ve written, runs tests, and reports results. It has a library of extras that you can use in your tests to help you test more effectively. Can be extended to writing plug-ins or installing third-party plug-ins. Can be used to test Python distributions.
