Communication is most important in business to get right, because it means understanding each other\u0027s point of view. From the planning stages of any activity to the tracking of its success, everything in the workplace depends on good communication.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrganisations are constantly inundated with information, from clients to suppliers, from agencies to internal departments. The number of people involved in a single project can be quite large these days because everything needs feedback and approval. When engaging with any individual involved in a project, you have to wear different hats based on seniority. Depending on whom you\u0027re trying to communicate with and what their goals are for the project, how you manage your business communication should change. In a business environment, communication is important to ensure efficiency, avoid misunderstandings, and avoid mistakes caused by miscommunication.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBusiness communication always has an end goal, unlike personal communication. Almost every company has rules for good business practice when it comes to communication within the workplace. Business communication used to be limited to phone calls and paperwork.

CART is a predictive algorithm used in Machine learning and it explains how the target variable\u2019s values can be predicted based on other matters. It is a decision tree where each fork is split into a predictor variable and each node has a prediction for the target variable at the end. Classically, this algorithm is referred to as decision trees, but on some platforms like R they are referred to by the more modern term CART. The CART algorithm provides a foundation for important algorithms like bagged decision trees, random forest and boosted decision trees.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs the name suggests, CART (Classification and Regression Trees) can be used for both classification and regression problems. The difference lies in the target variable. That is, With classification, we attempt to predict a class label. In other words, classification is used for problems where the output (target variable) takes a finite set of values, e.g., whether it will rain tomorrow or not. Meanwhile, regression is used to predict a numerical label. This means your output can take an infinite set of values, e.g., a house price.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDecision Trees are an important type of algorithm for predictive modeling machine learning.

You call a meeting to try to convince your boss and peers that your company needs to make an important move\u2014for instance, funding a risky but promising venture. Your argument is impassioned, your logic unassailable, your data bulletproof. Two weeks later, though, you learn that your brilliant proposal has been tabled. What went wrong?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll too often, people make the mistake of focusing too much on the content of their argument and not enough on how they deliver that message. Indeed, far too many decisions go the wrong way because information is presented ineffectively. In our experience, people can vastly improve their chances of having their proposals succeed by determining who the chief decision maker is among the executives they are trying to persuade and then tailoring their arguments to that business leader\u2019s decision-making style.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpecifically, we have found that executives typically fall into one of five decision-making categories: Charismatics can be initially exuberant about a new idea or proposal but will yield a final decision based on a balanced set of information. Thinkers can exhibit contradictory points of view within a single meeting and need to cautiously work through all the options before coming to a decision. Skeptics remain highly suspicious of data that don\u2019t fit with their worldview and make decisions based on their gut feelings. Followers make decisions based on how other trusted executives, or they themselves, have made similar decisions in the past. And controllers focus on the pure facts and analytics of a decision because of their own fears and uncertainties.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe five styles span a wide range of behaviors and characteristics. Controllers, for instance, have a strong aversion to risk; charismatics tend to seek it out. Despite such differences, people frequently use a one-size-fits-all approach when trying to convince their bosses, peers, and staff. They argue their case to a thinker the same way they would to a skeptic. Instead, managers should tailor their presentations to the executives they are trying to persuade, using the right buzzwords to deliver the appropriate information in the most effective sequence and format. After all, Bill Gates does not make decisions in the same way that Larry Ellison does.

A method many use to address this fear is to create presentation slides as a memory aid. However, this can be short-sighted because nothing erodes your credibility as a speaker faster than signaling to the audience that you depend on your slides.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeasoned presenters are able to announce a slide before showing it. At a minimum, they know their material so well that they only need to briefly glance at the slide to know what\u0027s coming next. You can achieve this by doing simple memory-boosting practices to remember your presentation material and, in turn, reduce your anxiety.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emong the most effective tips for memorizing lines is The Palace Method or Mind Palace. The Palace Method is based on research into brain science that has proven a very deep connection between how we remember an event and the space in which it occurred. The brain system important for memory is lso important for space; in other words, we remember things based on spatial locations or \u0022spatial scaffolds.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn a nutshell, The Palace Method is a memory technique that involves transforming what you want to remember into images and placing the images in a familiar mental location. In other words, you\u0027re giving your memories something to hang on to, a spatial anchor. You can then mentally tour your Memory Palace looking at your memories through these spatial anchors to help you recall each memory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are ready enroll now\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/33-memory-techniques-to-remember-anything/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5446692_2404_2.jpg","duration":"34 total mins","enrolledStudentsCount":"4,939.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Everyone who want to improve this skill"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":23,"averageValue":"4.1"},"instructors":[{"name":"ELOUAZZANI HAMZA","url":"/user/hamza-elouazzani/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":3.95}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"C3E2F60EA68D681BC7C2","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/master-six-sigma-certified-lean-six-sigma-black-belt-2023/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5443790,"title":"Master Six Sigma: Certified Lean Six Sigma Black Belt 2023","shortDescription":"Accredited Lean Six Sigma Black Belt training and certification. 40k\u002B Lean Six Sigma Black Belts certified.","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EMy name is Hamza ELOUAZZANI, I am a Logistics Specialist \u0026amp; Analyst, with a Master\u0027s degree in Logistics Management.
