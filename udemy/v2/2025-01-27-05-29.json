This course doesn\u0027t require you to have any prior experience in this software or any other structural design software. It will teach all the aspects of the software from very basic and will take you to the higher levels of the software as the course progresses. The course has been very systematically arranged so that you can best understand the software. Once you complete this course, you will have all the necessary knowledge to do the structural design of a building. You can do the structural design of buildings on your own projects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe spent years at college but yet there are some topics that are overlooked in the engineering syllabus but are important in working fields.

At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E*\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E javascript course contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript introduction\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript array\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript variables\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript functions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript objects\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript control statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript cookies\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript loop statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript data structures\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript error handling\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript regular expressions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESection 4- python programming language.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis course section provides an introduction to programming and the python language. students are introduced to core python programming concepts like conditionals, loops, variables, and functions. this section includes an overview of the various python aspects.

The Django Software Foundation (DSF) is in charge of maintaining it as a free and open-source framework. The primary objective of Django is to simplify the development process of complex, database-driven websites.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA framework, in general, is a set of pre-written code and tools that provide a structure for building applications. It offers a foundation and common functionalities, allowing developers to focus on application-specific logic rather than dealing with low-level details. Django provides numerous built-in features and libraries that assist in handling common web development tasks, such as URL routing, form handling, authentication, and database management.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are several reasons why developers choose Django for web development. Firstly, Django emphasizes the concept of \u0022batteries included,\u0022 meaning it comes with a wide range of ready-to-use components, reducing the need for external libraries. This saves development time and effort. Additionally, Django promotes the use of reusable code through its modular design, enabling developers to build applications quickly and efficiently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDjango can be used to develop both static and dynamic websites. For static websites, Django can serve as a content management system (CMS) where developers can easily manage and update the site\u0027s content. For dynamic websites, Django\u0027s MVT pattern plays a crucial role. The MVT architecture separates the application logic into three components:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModel: Represents the data structure and database schema. It defines the data models, relationships, and interactions with the database.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EView: Handles the business logic and acts as an intermediary between the model and the template. It processes requests, retrieves data from the model, and prepares it for rendering.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETemplate: Defines the presentation logic and represents the user interface.

Django\u0027s built-in ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) simplifies database operations, providing an intuitive way to interact with the database without writing complex SQL queries.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall, Django\u0027s robust features, scalability, security measures, and its supportive community make it an excellent choice for building large-scale, database-driven websites efficiently and effectively.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/python-tutorials-for-by-navinreddy/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/1793080_8158_3.jpg","duration":"14 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"127,537.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Beginners who want to get into software development, web development, machine learning"],"tags":["Python"],"rating":{"count":9767,"averageValue":"4.6"},"instructors":[{"name":"Navin Reddy","url":"/user/navinreddy2/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.650463}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"TELUSKO_JAN25","originalPrice":"\u20B93,499","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"6 hours","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-etabs-safe-in-the-structural-design-of-15-stories-rc/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":3361382,"title":"Learn ETABS \u0026 SAFE in the Structural Design of 15 Stories RC","shortDescription":"20 hr Analysis and design of 15 stories and one basement R.C Building on ETABS and SAFE  including earthquake design.","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EThis course not just a tutorial on software ETABS and SAFE but it is a complete understanding about structural design analysis, how civil engineer must begin with the project, how he/she must think, how we can determine the dimension of the element before modeling them check it in the software.
