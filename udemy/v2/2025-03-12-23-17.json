Students will explore the process of selecting representative samples from larger populations, a crucial step in making valid statistical inferences. Various sampling methods, such as simple random sampling, stratified sampling, cluster sampling, and systematic sampling, will be covered in detail, enabling students to understand how to collect data that accurately represents a broader group. The importance of sampling in real-world applications will be emphasized, including considerations of bias and sampling error that can impact the validity of conclusions drawn from sample data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA central focus of the course is the Central Limit Theorem, a key statistical concept that underpins much of inferential statistics. Through examples and hands-on exercises, students will learn how the CLT allows statisticians to approximate the distribution of sample means as normal, even when the population distribution is not normal. This property is foundational to many statistical methods, such as hypothesis testing and confidence interval estimation. Understanding the CLT enables students to appreciate the role of sample size, as larger samples yield distributions of sample means that are more consistently normal and provide a closer approximation of population parameters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe course also introduces the concept of standard error, which measures the variability of a sample statistic, such as the sample mean, around the true population parameter. Students will examine how standard error reflects the precision of sample estimates and how it can be minimized through increased sample sizes. Applications of standard error in constructing confidence intervals and performing hypothesis tests will be covered, allowing students to quantify uncertainty and make informed inferences based on sample data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThroughout the course, students will work on practical examples that demonstrate the applications of statistical concepts across various fields, such as social science research, economics, and quality control.
