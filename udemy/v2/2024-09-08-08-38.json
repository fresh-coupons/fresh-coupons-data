Are you stuck in tutorial hell? want to build your own CV but don\u0027t know how and when to start? If so, this is the right project for you. This course contains five projects for a reason. It covers the most common parts of every web project out there. Even if you are experienced as a developer, you should still give it a shot. and the projects are not similar and that\u0027s the surprise. Every project covers a certain topic.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EFirst of all, we are going to start with probably what every web project has which is the authentication system. It contains a couple of useful parts like validation, password hashing, sessions, and so on. And for the second project, we are going to take a look at the crud app which will help you manipulate data like a pro, set forms, update, delete and create data. The third project is all about building a URL shortening service and that\u0027s pretty simple and yet very practical. We are going to use a bit of Jquery on the way. For the fourth project, which is the largest one of them all, where we are going to integrate our code from the past project (auth system) and we are going to insert images and display them nicely. And that only leaves us with only one project, and that is the email sender that\u0027s one of the most important parts of any kind of development because it will teach you to send emails dynamically.

React, also known as React JS, is a powerful JavaScript library used for building custom, interactive user interfaces using UI components. Some of the most well known examples of organizations using React for their front-end include Netflix, Facebook, and Airbnb. Developed and maintained by Meta along with a community of independent developers, React remains free and open-source. React is a component based library built entirely on JavaScript, which makes it perfect for designing complex UI\u2019s. With React, developers can build encapsulated components that efficiently manage their own state and render UI updates specifically when data changes. For example, think of the automated content refresh feature you see on a twitter feed, or facebook like button. Here the state of the UI component changes on the page, without having to manually refresh when the data is updated. This is just one small, yet powerful feature of React.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThrough a complete hands-on project, this course will teach you all the fundamental principles of React that you must know to become a proficient React developer. We start right from the basics, including the tools needed to get started. From there we dive into JSX, functional components, props, callbacks, and various OnClick events. By this stage, the calculator will have a complete visual display, coupled with functional arithmetic operations. Students then move on to passing parameters in Callback functions, using the React State Hook, and debugging.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn addition to the hands-on React module, we also offer a comprehensive overview of JavaScript for those who need a refresher. Here we start with introducing students to the document object model (DOM) which defines the logical structure of HTML documents. From there we dive into JavaScript to demonstrate various methods in which DOM elements can be manipulated to add interactivity to static components. We start right from the basics, which includes JavaScript placement, and data output. From there we move on to variable declaration, arithmetic operations, operator precedence, data types, and objects. Once the foundations are covered, we move on to more complex operations using Arrays, Conditional Statements, JavaScript comparison operators, booleans and loops. Here students will learn to unleash the true power of JavaScript to render different outcomes based on user interaction. We will explore the use of functions to efficiently handle repetitive tasks and JavaScript events to handle output based on actions and occurrences. The section will conclude with a hands-on project where students will implement their knowledge to build a web based photo gallery and background color changer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/build-a-custom-e-commerce-site-in-react-javascript-basics/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4789922_401f.jpg","duration":"7 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"53,965.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Students interested in learning the Foundations of JavaScript","Students interested in learning the Foundations of ReactJS Library","Students interested in Building Interactive UI Components using React","Students interested in learning how to build a fully customized E-Commerce Site in React"],"tags":["JavaScript","React JS"],"rating":{"count":276,"averageValue":"4.2"},"instructors":[{"name":"YouAccel Training","url":"/user/youaccel/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.1973686}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"YOUACCELSEPT24","originalPrice":"\u20B91,999","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"2 hours","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/capcut-for-social-media-video-editing-beginner-to-pro/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":6070501,"title":"Capcut for Social Media Video Editing | Beginner to Pro","shortDescription":"Easy to making Social Media Videos: Reels, Shorts \u0026amp; Stories for YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Tik Tok","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EMaster the art of creating viral-worthy social media content with this comprehensive Capcut course.

In this course you will learn how to use JavaScript along with two powerful JavaScript libraries to build dynamic, interactive web pages. We start with introducing students to the document object model (DOM) which defines the logical structure of HTML documents. From there we dive into JavaScript to demonstrate various methods in which DOM elements can be manipulated to add interactivity to static components. The JavaScript section starts right from the basics, which includes JavaScript placement, and data output. From there we move on to variable declaration, arithmetic operations, operator precedence, data types, and objects. Once the foundations are covered, we move on to more complex operations using Arrays, Conditional Statements, JavaScript comparison operators, booleans and loops. Here students will learn to unleash the true power of JavaScript to render different outcomes based on user interaction. We will explore the use of functions to efficiently handle repetitive tasks and JavaScript events to handle output based on actions and occurrences. The section will conclude with a hands-on project where students will implement their knowledge to build a web based photo gallery and background color changer.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn the second section of this course, students will learn to work with jQuery - a powerful JavaScript library designed to simplify HTML DOM tree traversal and manipulation. jQuery is ultra lightweight, feature rich, and cross-platform compatible. It\u2019s one of the easiest libraries to work with for building out JavaScript features on an HTML web page. jQuery is excellent for event handling, CSS animations, and Ajax integration for asynchronous UI state changes. Similar to the JavaScript section, the jQuery module begins with the foundations. This includes instructions on embedding jQuery to a web page, and an intro into jQuery syntax. Students will learn to work with jQuery selectors, events, and toggling. From there we dive into animations using fades, slides, and the jQuery animate function. Students also learn about chaining, draggable objects, callback functions, the get content method, toggling classes, and filtering. By the end of the jQuery module, you will know how to build stunning animated web pages with ease.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn the last section of this course we\u2019ll explore React - a cutting edge JavaScript library for building state-of-the art user interface components. You\u2019ve likely seen React in action on some of the hottest web apps developed by fortune 500 companies. For example, Netflix, Facebook, and AirBnB all use React for their front-end UI. As a matter of fact, React was developed by Meta alongside a community of independent developers. Until this day, React remains free and open-source so it has plenty of support and documentation. Unlike jQuery which interacts with the document object model directly, React works through a \u201Cvirtual\u201D DOM. React is unaware of changes made to the DOM outside of React and determines updates based on its own internal representations. React is best for creating reusable code blocks for UI components and layering them on top of each other to minimize the number of times the DOM needs to be re-rendering on state changes. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe React section of this course starts off with a hands-on project where you\u2019ll learn how to work with functional React components, props, Callback functions, OnClick Events, and the React State hook to build a fully functional calculator. From there we will dive into project number two, where you will build a connect-4 clone. Here we will cover more intermediate concepts including passing props, destructuring, passing arguments to click events, various styling methods, and handling callbacks. You will also learn about the React key property, React lifecycle events, and conditional rendering. By the end you will have built a complete multi and single player connect-4 game board with built-in AI capabilities. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn the final section of the course we further unleash the power of React by building out a complete e-commerce site with multiple product categories, a product showcase, shopping cart feature, and much more. Here, we introduce a number of integral new concepts including: JSON server, Fetch API, and installing React router. These essential building blocks will be used to render the product categories, style the product list, and configure the product details page. From there we dive into styled components, refactoring the shop layout, and exploring the concept of \u201Ccontext\u201D in React. In the final stages of the project students will configure the shopping cart basket, and the checkout feature. We will also implement a product search feature, followed by in-depth exercises on validating input forms in React.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAs you can see this course covers a tremendous bit of ground. Best of all it\u2019s co-authored by Tim Maclachlan - a renowned senior full-stack developer with over 20 years of commercial development experience. As a multi-faceted developer, Tim specializes in algorithmic, analytical and mobile development. To date, he\u2019s written hundreds of applications and worked in a number of industries from commercial aviation and military, to banking and finance. Tim has a genuine passion for teaching others how to become better coders and looks forward to interacting with his students.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWith that said, we hope you\u2019re just as excited about this course as we are, if so - hit that enroll button and let\u2019s get started.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-javascript-jquery-and-react-bootcamp-hands-on/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4789948_a375.jpg","duration":"13 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"57,033.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Students interested in working with Popular JavaScript Libraries","Students interested in Building Interactive UI Components using React and jQuery","Students interested in Mastering Front-End Development using JavaScript"],"tags":["JavaScript","jQuery","React JS"],"rating":{"count":397,"averageValue":"4.6"},"instructors":[{"name":"YouAccel Training","url":"/user/youaccel/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.5}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"YOUACCELSEPT24","originalPrice":"\u20B91,999","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"2 hours","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/business-development-sales-marketing-professional-diploma/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5848270,"title":"Business Development, Sales \u0026 Marketing Professional Diploma","shortDescription":"Business Development, Sales and Marketing Professional Diploma by MTF Institute","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWelcome to course\u003C/strong\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003EBusiness Development, Sales \u0026amp; Marketing Professional Diploma by MTF Institute\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECourse provided by \u003Cstrong\u003EMTF Institute of Management, Technology and Finance\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMTF\u003C/strong\u003E is the global educational and research institute with HQ at Lisbon, Portugal, focused on business \u0026amp; professional hybrid (on-campus and online) education at areas: Business \u0026amp; Administration, Science \u0026amp; Technology, Banking \u0026amp; Finance. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMTF R\u0026amp;D \u003C/strong\u003Ecenter focused on research activities at areas: Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Data Science, Big Data, WEB3, Blockchain, Cryptocurrency \u0026amp; Digital Assets, Metaverses, Digital Transformation, Fintech, Electronic Commerce, Internet of Things. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMTF\u003C/strong\u003E is the official partner of: IBM, Intel, Microsoft, member of the Portuguese Chamber of Commerce and Industry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMTF \u003C/strong\u003Eis present in 208 countries and has been chosen by more than 380,000 students.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECourse Author: Igor Dmitriev\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDigital Transformation and Banking Expert\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEducation:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMBA, The Boston University\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster of Science at Engineering (Technical) Management,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe State University of New York at Buffalo\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster of Science at Informatics and Economics,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESix Sigma Black Belt\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EExperience:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExpert at Banking (\u0026gt; 18 years), FinTech \u0026amp; Digital (\u0026gt; 15 years),\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExperienced Manager (\u0026gt; 14 years) with successful track of records\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eat personal and corporate entrepreneurship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore than 12 years at worldwide banking groups such us\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESociete Generale , Raiffeisenbank\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExperience at roles: CEO, Head of Business, Chief Digital \u0026amp;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMarketing Officer, Head of Digital Transformation and Channels, Head of Products and Marketing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBusiness Development involves activities aimed at creating long-term value for an organization through forming strategic partnerships, identifying new business opportunities, and fostering growth.

This course teaches students how to create modern, interactive web pages using the Bootstrap framework and React JavaScript library. The course starts with an introduction into Bootstrap with a focus on its reputation in the development community as the number one choice for mobile-first front-end web frameworks. Bootstrap is a well documented collection of reusable code written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We start with exploring the foundations of Bootstrap, including embedding it into projects, and building out the basic Bootstrap page structure. From there we catapult into the infamous Bootstrap grid system, along with the commonly used three column web page layout. After the introductory topics, students learn to work with a number of components from typography, tables and image styling right up to wells, alerts, and buttons. As part of the course we demonstrate how to build out intricate navigation menus using dropdown, collapse, accordion, and pill menus. We will also cover form styling, carousels, modals, scrollspy and just about every other Bootstrap component that\u2019s instrumental to your journey as a front-end developer. The module concludes with a hands-on project, where students will use a Bootstrap theme to build a stunning web page from scratch.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn the second section of the course, we explore React. React, also known as React JS, is a powerful JavaScript library used for building custom, interactive user interfaces using UI components. Similar to Bootstrap, React is a well documented free and open source library. The project was founded by Meta and a network of independent developers. In this section, students learn how to use the React library through a series of hands-on projects. The React section of this course starts off with a hands-on project where you\u2019ll learn how to work with functional React components, props, Callback functions, OnClick Events, and the React State hook to build a fully functional calculator. From there we will dive into project number two, where you will build a connect-4 clone. Here we will cover more intermediate concepts including passing props, destructuring, passing arguments to click events, various styling methods, and handling callbacks. You will also learn about the React key property, React lifecycle events, and conditional rendering. By the end you will have built a complete multi and single player connect-4 game board with built-in AI capabilities. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn the final section of the course we further unleash the power of React by building out a complete e-commerce site with multiple product categories, a product showcase, shopping cart feature, and much more. Here, we introduce a number of integral new concepts including: JSON server, Fetch API, and installing React router. These essential building blocks will be used to render the product categories, style the product list, and configure the product details page. From there we dive into styled components, refactoring the shop layout, and exploring the concept of \u201Ccontext\u201D in React. In the final stages of the project students will configure the shopping cart basket, and the checkout feature. We will also implement a product search feature, followed by in-depth exercises on validating input forms in React.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAs you can see this course covers a tremendous bit of ground.

With this course you have the opportunity to relive this fond childhood memory by building a connect-4 clone using React. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EReact, also known as React JS, is a powerful JavaScript library used for building custom, interactive user interfaces using UI components. Some of the most well known examples of organizations using React for their front-end include Netflix, Facebook, and Airbnb. Developed and maintained by Meta along with a community of independent developers, React remains free and open-source. React is a component based library built entirely on JavaScript, which makes it perfect for designing complex UI\u2019s. With React, developers can build encapsulated components that efficiently manage their own state and render UI updates specifically when data changes. For example, think of the automated content refresh feature you see on a twitter feed, or Facebook like button. Here the state of the UI component changes on the page, without having to manually refresh when the data is updated. This is just one small, yet powerful feature of React.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThrough a complete hands-on project, this course will teach you all the fundamental principles of React that you must know to become a proficient React developer. We start with the tools needed to get started with React, along with instructions on creating the Connect-4 game board. From there we dive in to React OnClick Events, Passing Props, Destructing, React Children, and Passing Arguments. With a solid understanding of the foundations, students move on to various styling techniques for the game components, along with Dynamic classes, and handling callbacks. Here we\u2019ll explore inline, global, and dynamic styling coupled with dynamic classes. We will then move on to the React State Hook, React Key Property and initializing the game modules. Students then tackle more intermediate concepts including the logical components of calculating a winner, determining a draw, and React Lifecycle events. In the last module, we explore the implementation of AI for automated move suggestions, and single player games.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn addition to the hands-on React module, we also offer a comprehensive overview of JavaScript for those who need a refresher. Here we start with introducing students to the document object model (DOM) which defines the logical structure of HTML documents. From there we dive into JavaScript to demonstrate various methods in which DOM elements can be manipulated to add interactivity to static components. We start right from the basics, which includes JavaScript placement, and data output. From there we move on to variable declaration, arithmetic operations, operator precedence, data types, and objects. Once the foundations are covered, we move on to more complex operations using Arrays, Conditional Statements, JavaScript comparison operators, Booleans and loops. Here students will learn to unleash the true power of JavaScript to render different outcomes based on user interaction. We will explore the use of functions to efficiently handle repetitive tasks and JavaScript events to handle output based on actions and occurrences. The section will conclude with a hands-on project where students will implement their knowledge to build a web based photo gallery and background color changer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/build-a-connect-4-clone-in-react-javascript-foundations/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4789918_7294.jpg","duration":"5.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"44,832.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Students interested in learning how to build interactive web pages using JavaScript","Students interested in learning ReactJS","Students interested in front-end UI Development using React","Students interested in learning JavaScript Foundations"],"tags":["JavaScript","React JS"],"rating":{"count":184,"averageValue":"4.2"},"instructors":[{"name":"YouAccel Training","url":"/user/youaccel/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.3}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"YOUACCELSEPT24","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"2 hours","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/entrepreneurship-ideas-market-analysis-competitors-place/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5836030,"title":"Entrepreneurship: Ideas, Market Analysis, Competitors, Place","shortDescription":"Entrepreneurship and Business: Market Analysis and Competitive Intelligence at launching of your business.
