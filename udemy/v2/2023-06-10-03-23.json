React, also known as React JS, is a powerful JavaScript library used for building custom, interactive user interfaces using UI components. Some of the most well known examples of organizations using React for their front-end include Netflix, Facebook, and Airbnb. Developed and maintained by Meta along with a community of independent developers, React remains free and open-source. React is a component based library built entirely on JavaScript, which makes it perfect for designing complex UI\u2019s. With React, developers can build encapsulated components that efficiently manage their own state and render UI updates specifically when data changes. For example, think of the automated content refresh feature you see on a twitter feed, or facebook like button. Here the state of the UI component changes on the page, without having to manually refresh when the data is updated. This is just one small, yet powerful feature of React.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThrough a complete hands-on project, this course will teach you all the fundamental principles of React that you must know to become a proficient React developer. We start right from the basics, including the tools needed to get started. From there we dive into JSX, functional components, props, callbacks, and various OnClick events. By this stage, the calculator will have a complete visual display, coupled with functional arithmetic operations. Students then move on to passing parameters in Callback functions, using the React State Hook, and debugging.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn addition to the hands-on React module, we also offer a comprehensive overview of JavaScript for those who need a refresher. Here we start with introducing students to the document object model (DOM) which defines the logical structure of HTML documents. From there we dive into JavaScript to demonstrate various methods in which DOM elements can be manipulated to add interactivity to static components. We start right from the basics, which includes JavaScript placement, and data output. From there we move on to variable declaration, arithmetic operations, operator precedence, data types, and objects. Once the foundations are covered, we move on to more complex operations using Arrays, Conditional Statements, JavaScript comparison operators, booleans and loops. Here students will learn to unleash the true power of JavaScript to render different outcomes based on user interaction. We will explore the use of functions to efficiently handle repetitive tasks and JavaScript events to handle output based on actions and occurrences. The section will conclude with a hands-on project where students will implement their knowledge to build a web based photo gallery and background color changer. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAs you can see this course covers a tremendous bit of ground.

Does it impact your life and your money? Well, all that I would say is, \u201CIf you can\u2019t negotiate effectively with people, you shouldn\u2019t buy/sell anything for more than a few dollars.\u201D\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason I say this is because regardless of the type of work we do, knowing how to negotiate effectively can greatly impact our success and our satisfaction. Wondering how? I will tell you how\u2026 but before that let me remind you how often you negotiate in life. From childhood, you must have practiced the art of negotiation \u2013 Bedtime, a treat, a promotion, a raise, an extended deadline. Yet you are not good at negotiations. Why? Does it demand a different level of intellect and expertise? Well, I will say \u201CNo\u201D to the former and \u201CYes\u201D to the latter. There are some techniques and a process when put into practice enable you to save thousands of dollars, but unfortunately, no one has told you about these techniques yet, and hence, you are missing out. And by this time, I am sure you must have figured out what I am doing here. I am here to help you uncover all these techniques in this course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt may be\u2026or may not be difficult for you to digest the fact that we all negotiate on a daily basis. On a personal level, we negotiate with friends, family, landlords, car sellers, and employers, among others. We come across hundreds of situations that put our negotiation skills to the test. Whether buying a house or car, reviewing your salary with your boss, or deliberating contracts for your business, your success in each of\u003Cstrong\u003E \u003C/strong\u003Ethese activities will be heavily dependent on your ability to negotiate. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut how come I am speaking so highly of negotiation skills? Well, I\u0027ve spent thousands of hours reading books, articles, and videos and doing real-life research aiming to master negotiation conversations. And now, I want my learnings to benefit you so that you don\u2019t need to chart the long road which I have trodden. I want my long road to be your shortcut and hence, I have created a \u003Cstrong\u003E7-step model \u201CN.E.U.R.O Negotiation System\u003C/strong\u003E\u201D. Combining the principles of Evolution and Brain Science, this program demystifies the science of negotiation like nothing else. This course will help you prepare for and conduct real-world negotiations, from personal to professional, small to large, and daily to extraordinary.

Drawing on the latest research and best practices across a breadth of industries, the course goes far beyond simplistic formulas such as \u0022win-win\u0022 and \u0022win-lose.\u0022 Instead, it provides hard-hitting, practical, intensive, and transformative techniques.

It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E*\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E javascript course contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript introduction\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript array\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript variables\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript functions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript objects\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript control statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript cookies\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript loop statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript data structures\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript error handling\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript regular expressions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003Esection 2- learn PHP\u0026nbsp;programming language\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis section will learn the basic structure of a web application and how a web browser interacts with a web server.

This course provides an in-depth overview of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). The EC2 service is an essential building block in becoming an AWS certified cloud practitioner. We will start with exploring key concepts relevant to EC2, followed by a hands-on practical guide to deploying compute resources on AWS. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe term \u201CScalable Cloud Computing\u201D has now become synonymous with Amazon Web Services. For nearly a decade, AWS has been powering some of the world\u2019s most popular websites and applications. Amazon EC2, is considered the computational backbone of AWS.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ETo illustrate how Amazon EC2 works, we explore the concept of virtualization. Virtualization is the process of creating a software-based virtual representation of a server. When we deploy an EC2 \u201CInstance\u201D we\u2019re creating a virtual representation of a physical server and it\u2019s resources.\u003Cstrong\u003E \u003C/strong\u003EThis includes: CPU, Memory (RAM), Storage, and network resources such as Bandwidth. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ESimilar to physical servers that you might find on-premises,\u003Cstrong\u003E \u003C/strong\u003Evirtual EC2 instances can also have different configurations. As a matter of fact, AWS offers the most comprehensive configuration options when it comes to deploying virtual servers.\u003Cstrong\u003E \u003C/strong\u003EThese configurations can easily be adapted to our resource needs, in real-time.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe level of customization a cloud provider can accommodate, will define the sophistication level of it\u2019s overall service. Not all cloud services were created equal. AWS, is known to have the highest level of configuration options when compared to just about any other service. The AWS platform caters to both micro and enterprise level clients, using one of the most scalable and advanced virtualization infrastructures available.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EBeyond the physical hardware customization and scalability, virtualization also accommodates the deployment of any operating system on the virtual machine. As you will see, we have the flexibility of deploying both Linux and Windows servers, using a variety of pre-configured virtual applications known as AMIs (Amazon Machine Images).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to a theoretical deep dive into Amazon EC2, this course will also provide you with practical hands-on experience in working with the key features of EC2.

In this course, you will learn how to effectively manage and optimize your storage on Amazon Web Services (AWS).
