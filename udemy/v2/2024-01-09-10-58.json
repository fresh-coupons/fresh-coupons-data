It assumes that you\u0027re new to the language, so it gets you started with basic functionality such as creating functions, creating variables, and calling these lines of code from your standard HTML pages. It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E*\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E javascript course contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript introduction\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript array\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript variables\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript functions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript objects\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript control statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript cookies\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript loop statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript data structures\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript error handling\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript regular expressions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/css-bootstrap-javascript-web-development-course/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4548492_0942.jpg","duration":"5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"66,078.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Beginner Full Stack Developers","Beginner Web Developer"],"tags":["CSS","JavaScript","Web Development"],"rating":{"count":732,"averageValue":"4.4"},"instructors":[{"name":"PROPER DOT INSTITUTE","url":"/user/vivek-dahibhate-2/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.4859157}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"85352350C6429B6F11A7","originalPrice":"\u20B91,999","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/no-oil-cooking-meat-recipes-no-cholesterol-fat-free-food/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":754112,"title":"Healthy living with \u0022No Oil\u0022 Recipes - Non Vegetarian","shortDescription":"Better Health.

In the course, we discuss all the necessary issues, work with examples and exercises, starting from the basics: what is SQL and how to install and run a local MySQL server on your home computer, how to use SQL itself from both the console and MySQL Workbench. Then we discuss the topic of CRUD: Create, Read, Update, Delete where we discuss all these activities in detail. The next stage will be text and aggregate functions where you will learn to modify the results of database queries. Next, an important step will be learning how to create queries with a logic layer and calling the appropriate conditions that will make the query result dependent on their fulfillment. Finally, we discuss the topic of relations - their types, how to create and invoke, handle them or activate events with triggers. At the end of the course, we will work on the data set in several tables connected by relations. In each section you will also find additional exercises that will allow you to check your knowledge and skills as well as notes summarizing the issues discussed.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/mysql-creating-and-managing-relational-databases/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/3208845_fb21_2.jpg","duration":"5.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"9,297.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["beginner database administrators","beginner database developers","students","people who need to organize their data systems","researchers","everyone interested"],"tags":["Database Management","Database Programming","MySQL","SQL"],"rating":{"count":75,"averageValue":"4.9"},"instructors":[{"name":"Krzysztof Raczynski","url":"/user/analogowy/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.85}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"NEWYEAR245","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"22 hours","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-microsoft-excel-pivot-tables-and-pivot-charts/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":2905398,"title":"The Complete Microsoft Excel Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts","shortDescription":"Excel Charts, Excel Analytics, Excel Pivot Table , Excel Pivot Charts, Excel Dashboard, Excel Data Analysis \u0026amp; Reporting","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERecent Student\u0027s Reviews\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGreat course with interactive dashboard, pivot charts, pivot table and exercises to help student understand the course - Clark Belle Ortega\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI never liked excel but I am actually enjoying to learn as you are teaching in a great way. \u0022Wow\u0022. -Preeti J.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eone of the best explained video on pivot table. thank you so much for providing this video - Pratapm537\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVery good course!
