This is the 1st part of your business that is visible to the world. This is made up of your proven product pages, branded store front, and basic automations (like email) that are all tested and proven to convert your customers.

It\u2019s the first customer acquisition channel that you master, which you can reliably depend on for sales. What\u2019s most important here is that you don\u2019t get distracted trying to get sales from 10 channels at once, before mastering one. Focus on only ONE branch until that is a repeatable and reliable source of sales for your business. ONE acquisition channel is enough to build a 6-figure, if not 7-figure business.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPillar 4: The Branches \u2013 Once you have at least one sustainable branch to your business you can begin to build out additional acquisition arms ( or funnels) of your business.

Simply put, If you want to access databases then yes, you need to know SQL.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is not really difficult to learn SQL. SQL is not a programming language, it\u2019s a query language. The primary objective where SQL was created was to give the possibility to common people to get interesting data from the database. It is also an English-like language so anyone who can use English at a basic level can write SQL queries easily.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESQL is one of the most sought-after skills by hiring employers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can earn good money\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHow much time does it take to learn SQL?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESQL is easy but no one can determine the learning time it takes. It totally depends on you. The method we adopted to help you learn SQL quickly starts from the basics and takes you to advanced level within hours. You can follow the same, but remember you can learn nothing without practicing it. Practice is the only way to learn SQL quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat\u0027s the difference between SQL and PostgreSQL?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESQL is a language. Specifically, the \u0022Structured Query Language\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPostgreSQL is one of several database systems, or RDMS (Relational Database Management System). PostgresSQL is one of several RDMS\u0027s, others of which are Oracle, Informix, MySQL, and MSQL.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of these RDMSs use SQL as their language. Each of them has minor variations in the \u0022dialect\u0022 of SQL that they use, but it\u0027s all still SQL.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhich is better, PostgreSQL or Oracle SQL?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth are excellent products with unique strengths, and the choice is often a matter of personal preference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPostgreSQL offers overall features for traditional database applications, it is open source and offers great support.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOracle Database has decades of experience and high levels of development expertise. It not only provides more transactions per second than PostgreSQL, but also arguably provides higher levels of security. However, many of Oracle\u2019s security features come at an added cost. Oracle is secure and ensures that user data is not tampered with through prompt updates.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth dialects are very popular today, but PostgreSQL has gained market share recently and is trending upwards because (some have claimed) it has features more suited to today\u2019s dynamic development requirements..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWho uses these databases?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are a few examples of companies that use PostgreSQL: Apple, BioPharm, Etsy, IMDB, Macworld, Debian, Fujitsu, Red Hat, Sun Microsystem, Cisco, Skype.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECompanies that use Oracle SQL:\u003Cstrong\u003E \u003C/strong\u003EGartner, Nike, Costco, Airbnb, eBay etc.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/postgresql-oracle-sql/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5013832_4a6d_4.jpg","duration":"9.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"9,496.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Working Professionals beginning their Data journey","Anyone curious to learn and compare both PostgreSQL and Oracle SQL","Students about to join their first corporate job"],"tags":["MySQL","Oracle SQL","PostgreSQL","SQL"],"rating":{"count":92,"averageValue":"4.4"},"instructors":[{"name":"Start-Tech Trainings","url":"/user/start-tech-academy-2/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.5},{"name":"Start-Tech Academy","url":"/user/start-tech-academy/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.5}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"DIWALIFREE24","originalPrice":"\u20B92,699","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/automate-restaurant-management-operations-with-ai-odoo/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":6003326,"title":"Automate Restaurant Management Operations with AI Odoo 17","shortDescription":"How to Optimize the Restaurant Supply Chain Management Solutions-Automation and Digitization with Best Practices.","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy study food and beverage management?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStudying food and beverage management will equip you with a comprehensive understanding of the food and beverage industry and the skills and knowledge needed to succeed in this dynamic and exciting field. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe curriculum typically covers menu planning and development, kitchen operations management, customer service, financial management, personnel management, marketing and promotions, and industry trends.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFood and Beverage AI Management: Gateway to a Rewarding Career\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA food and beverage manager is a person who oversees the operations of restaurants, bars, cafes, catering services, and other establishments that serve food and drinks to customers. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey are responsible for managing the staff, the menu, the budget, the inventory, the quality, the safety, and the customer satisfaction.

Below are some reasons why you should learn Machine learning in R\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. It\u2019s a popular language for Machine Learning at top tech firms. Almost all of them hire data scientists who use R. Facebook, for example, uses R to do behavioral analysis with user post data. Google uses R to assess ad effectiveness and make economic forecasts. And by the way, it\u2019s not just tech firms: R is in use at analysis and consulting firms, banks and other financial institutions, academic institutions and research labs, and pretty much everywhere else data needs analyzing and visualizing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Learning the data science basics is arguably easier in R than Python. R has a big advantage: it was designed specifically with data manipulation and analysis in mind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Amazing packages that make your life easier. As compared to Python, R was designed with statistical analysis in mind, it has a fantastic ecosystem of packages and other resources that are great for data science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Robust, growing community of data scientists and statisticians. As the field of data science has exploded, usage of R and Python has exploded with it, becoming one of the fastest-growing languages in the world (as measured by StackOverflow). That means it\u2019s easy to find answers to questions and community guidance as you work your way through projects in R.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Put another tool in your toolkit. No one language is going to be the right tool for every job. Like Python, adding R to your repertoire will make some projects easier \u2013 and of course, it\u2019ll also make you a more flexible and marketable employee when you\u2019re looking for jobs in data science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat are the major advantages of using R over Python?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs compared to Python, R has a higher user base and the biggest number of statistical packages and libraries available.
