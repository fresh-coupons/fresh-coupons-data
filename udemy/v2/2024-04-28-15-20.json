Some of the online communities for learning purposes are \u003Cstrong\u003EStackOverflow\u003C/strong\u003E, \u003Cstrong\u003EJava Forums\u003C/strong\u003E, etc. Also, there is a lot of resources like \u003Cstrong\u003EGeeksforGeeks\u003C/strong\u003E etc. available on the internet regarding Java.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E4. Java has an abundant API:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EJava has an abundant Application Programming Interface (API) that includes many Java classes, packages, interfaces, etc. This is useful for constructing applications without necessarily knowing their inside implementations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJava has mainly three types of API i.e. \u003Cstrong\u003EOfficial Java core API\u2019s, Optional official Java API\u2019s and Unofficial API\u2019s.\u003C/strong\u003E These API\u2019s overall are used for almost everything including networking, I/O, databases, media, XML parsing, speech synthesis, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E5. Java has multiple Open Source Libraries:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOpen-source libraries have resources that can be copied, studied, changed, shared, etc. There are multiple open-source libraries in Java such as \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJHipster, Maven, Google Guava, Apache Commons\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E, etc. that can be used to make Java development easier, cheaper and faster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E6. Java has Powerful Development Tools:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThere are many Integrated development environments (IDE\u2019s) in Java that provide various facilities for software development to programmers. Powerful Java IDE\u2019s such as \u003Cstrong\u003EEclipse, NetBeans, IntelliJ IDEA, etc.\u003C/strong\u003E play a big role in the success of Java.\u003Cbr\u003EThese IDE\u2019s provide many facilities such as debugging, syntax highlighting, code completion, language support, automated refactoring, etc. that make coding in Java easier and faster.\u003Cbr\u003EJava has created a base for the Android operating system and opted around \u003Cstrong\u003E90% of fortune 500 companies\u003C/strong\u003E to developing a lot of back-end applications. Also, it plays a great role in Apache Hadoop data processing, Amazon Web Services, and Windows Azure, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E7. Java is Free of Cost:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOne of the reasons Java is very popular among individual programmers is that it is available under the Oracle Binary Code License (BCL) free of charge. This means that Java is free for development and test environments, but for commercial purposes, a small fee is required.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E8. Java is Platform Independent:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EJava is platform-independent as the Java source code is converted to byte code by the compiler which can then be executed on any platform using the Java Virtual Machine. Java is also known as a WORA (write once, run anywhere) language because it is platform-independent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the development of most Java applications occurs in a Windows environment while they are run on a UNIX platform because of the platform-independent nature of Java.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E9. Java has great Documentation Support:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe documentation support for Java is excellent using \u003Cstrong\u003EJavadoc\u003C/strong\u003E which is the documentation generator for Java. It uses the Java source code to generate the API documentation in HTML format. So, Javadoc provides a great reference while coding in Java so that understanding the code is quite simple.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E10. Java is Versatile:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EJava is very versatile as it is used for programming applications on the web, mobile, desktop, etc. using different platforms.

The World Wide Web Consortium\u0027s XML 1.0 Specification of 1998 and several other related specifications - all of them free open standards - define XML. The design goals of XML emphasize simplicity, generality, and usability across the Internet. It is a textual data format with strong support via Unicode for different human languages. Although the design of XML focuses on documents, the language is widely used for the representation of arbitrary data structures such as those used in web services. Several schema systems exist to aid in the definition of XML-based languages, while programmers have developed many application programming interfaces (APIs) to aid the processing of XML data.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u0022\u003Cstrong\u003EXSD\u003C/strong\u003E (\u003Cstrong\u003EXML Schema Definition\u003C/strong\u003E), a recommendation of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), specifies how to formally describe the elements in an Extensible Markup Language (XML) document. It can be used by programmers to verify each piece of item content in a document. They can check if it adheres to the description of the element it is placed in. Like all XML schema languages, XSD can be used to express a set of rules to which an XML document must conform in order to be considered \u0022valid\u0022 according to that schema. However, unlike most other schema languages, XSD was also designed with the intent that determination of a document\u0027s validity would produce a collection of information adhering to specific data types. Such a post-validation \u003Cem\u003Einfoset\u003C/em\u003E can be useful in the development of XML document processing software.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat you\u0027ll learn from this course:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E- You will learn all the theory about how to use XML language correctly, as well as all about its general and specific syntaxes, according to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) official recommendations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- You will learn all the practice about how to code your XML files, using the elements, attributes and types - default and custom ones - from the referred XSD schemas, as well as how to test the correctness and validation of your XML instances against their referred XSD docs using Eclipse IDE automation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- You will adventure into the complete theory background about how to create your own XSD schema documents and master the details about XSD general and specific syntaxes, according to W3C official specifications.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- You will practice, through tens of examples, how to code your own XSD files, using the 3 design methods suggested by W3C, as well as how to take advantage of all main base elements, attributes and types (default W3C library/namespace) to create your own personalized XML/XSD components.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- You will have pretty clear what default and custom namespaces are, as well as prefixes, both at the XML instances as at the XSD documents. You\u0027ll learn how to import and include multiple XSD documents into one same XSD and also how to refer to multiple XSD documents from one same XML instance, nice and easy... even using your own personal brand as the prefix for customizing your code (in my case: danielpm1982).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- All this course\u0027s theory, as well as the good practices and techniques used, are based on the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and W3Schools contents, here with much better and complete explanations and practical examples.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- After doing this course, you\u0027ll understand much easier all the document types used at Web Services development, or any other application that uses XML and XSD (or WSDL).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- All source codes are available at my GitHub, as well as attached to each practice lecture, as a zip file. You can easily download, study, reuse and test them yourself, for learning purposes, and even create much better examples. This is how you learn: starting from the basics and evolving, through practicing, until proficiency. All at your own pace and time and re-watching any lecture as many times as you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Additional content, as WSDL and JSON theory and practical lectures, as well as lectures with sample Web Services projects, demonstrating the real world applicability of XML, XSD, WSDL and JSON, will be added incrementally within the next months, at this same course. But you can finish this course with the current content, as it is, and receive your Udemy Certification on that\u2026 and if you want, you may return later, watch the future extra content lectures (WSDL and JSON) and, at the end, receive another Udemy Certification with the updated content and course name. All students will be notified when any future content is added.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- This course is already composed of more than 10 hours, a workload greater than almost all other same-topic courses at Udemy.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPrerequisites:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E- If you wanna practice, you should have Eclipse IDE installed on your PC or notebook. But you can just watch the theory and practical lectures, at any device with internet access, in case you have no computer available at that moment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- No programming languages or frameworks are required for this course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- No silly or useless tests will be imposed onto you. You will know you got the content right when you implement your own code and test it successfully, as done at our practical lectures.

All related links, with W3C content, are attached to each theory lecture description.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat\u0027s the difference between taking this course and simply viewing W3Schools material at their own site ?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/strong\u003EAlthough the content is almost entirely referenced on W3C publications, this course offers much better, organized and understandable explanations about the content, and also a much greater set of examples, using Eclipse IDE, from the easiest to the most complex ones. At W3Schools site, for instance, you only find very simple snippets of code.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat\u0027s the difference between taking this course and the other XML/XSD courses at Udemy ?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E- No objection at all to those who may take more than one course. But this one has an innovative methodology, is more organized and complete (over 10 hours of theory and practices already), as well as it has much better examples, explained step by step, without any hurried 2-3 min lectures. It covers IN FULL everything that W3C suggests about XML and XSD.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- This course is organized similar to university or college lectures, with an average of 1h per lecture. The organization is oriented towards the content itself and not short time limited lectures. I think prioritizing the content on the curriculum organization contributes way better to cohesiveness as well as to the organization and consolidation of the content in anyone\u0027s brain. 2-3 min classes end up being a big confusion resulted from a too high fragmentation level of the content. Students always criticize on other courses that everything\u0027s too hastily delivered, as if the students already knew the subjects. Here, and differently from that, you\u0027ll see it\u0027s all nicely and easily delivered, and you won\u0027t get lost on the content, even if you never heard about XML or any structural or programming language before. You\u0027re free, though, to plan your own individual learning schedule. Just take note of the subject you last saw, and then continue from there when you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Finally, this course is divided into Theory and Practice lectures. You\u0027ll, thus, have multiple chances, from multiple explanation perspectives, to learn or complement the acknowledging of each topic, subtopics, practices, and so on. And, of course, at your own time, pace and individual needs. The access to this course will be forever yours (it doesn\u0027t expire) and you\u0027ll be able to review any lecture as much as you want. A big advantage of e-learning recorded lectures compared to live face-to-face attendance lectures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWelcome to the course !!

NFTs have gained significant attention in recent years, especially in the realms of digital art, collectibles, gaming, and virtual real estate, as they provide a way to establish scarcity and ownership in the digital world.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearning about Web3 and NFTs is important for companies and managers for several reasons:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnderstanding Emerging Technologies: Web3 and NFTs represent significant shifts in how we interact with the internet and digital assets.

I liked the background scenery as well in the exercises. Nature does connect us to our bodies like nothing else. I learned a lot. I came across a video about EFT Tapping on Facebook. There are many school districts teaching it to children as stress and anxiety effect so many children today. And this is leading to increased mental health issues. I felt that watching the video was clearly not enough information about EFT and somewhere in my searching this course popped up. I didn\u0027t hesitate to sign up because I have taken other courses through UDEMY and I would recommend them to anyone. I am a middle school teacher and it is my goal to bring EFT into my school. I showed the video I found to our assistant principal and she was very intrigued and wanted to know more. So now, thanks to Alan, I have that much more information to share with her. There are RESOURCES provided with this course! Thank you! I do wish there was a diagram that not only showed the Meridian points but the organs each one is connected to. It would make it easier to remember.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGloria Budz\t \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E If\u003C/strong\u003E you have been suffering from negative feelings or emotions\u0026nbsp; this is the course to help you beat that feeling of helplessness with a easy to learn and apply technique that I will teach and guide you through each exercise so that you will be able to change how you think and feel and become a more relaxed person in all areas of your life. The technique I will be teaching you is called EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique) it is a gentle tapping technique where when you tap on certain points on the body while thinking about a problem you reduce or eliminate the bad feelings attached to that problem. This technique may seem a little silly however the reason you are reading this is because what you have tried before has not worked whether that be medication or therapy. I am so confident you will get results from taking the time to learn and apply this technique that Udemy is offering you a 30 day money back guarantee so there is no risk or cost to you if what I teach you does not work. However as I have been using this technique for so many years with excellent results with my clients that I decided to create this course so I could reach out and help as many people as I can.\u0026nbsp; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESo what will I teach you\u003C/strong\u003E\u0026nbsp; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat is EFT\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe EFT Tapping points\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEFT Tapping Points and Energy Meridians they are connected to\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProof that mind and body are connected\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Setup Phrase\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Reminder Phrase\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Breathing Exercise \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet go negative emotions with EFT\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMopping up with EFT\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMopping up with EFT using color\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe terrible cost of unforgiveness\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEliminate anger towards yourself and others with EFT\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy Secret Tips\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdvanced EFT Technique\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBonus EFT Video Sessions \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.
