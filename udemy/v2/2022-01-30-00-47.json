life coach helps others define how they want to improve themselves, helps them develop a plan to do so and holds them accountable to implement the plan. Their role is actually quite simple. They help us answer three questions: What do I want to change about myself, How do I change,\u0026nbsp; How do I commit to changing, Whether it\u2019s being a better lawyer, a leader or manager or whether it\u2019s more personal, such as getting in shape, losing weight, being a better parent, change starts with identifying what you want to change about yourself, figuring out how to get from here to there and making that change a reality. Life coaches help you do this. They help you to get to know yourself better, define what you really want and work with you on how to get it. Successful individuals set goals and pursue them. When we feel stuck, we\u2019re in a rut, or we find ourselves asking, How did I get here? we know we need to make a change, but we have difficulty defining the change and have less of an idea of how to make it.\u0026nbsp; life coach helps you answer these questions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA life coach can lead you to water but can\u2019t make you drink.

This is where the best of intentions only get you so far. This is where it\u2019s you changing, ever so incrementally, step by step, inch by inch, making a new you. Your life coach can offer advice, motivation and inspiration but you\u2019re the one on the field. You\u2019re the one running and hustling, blocking and tackling, throwing and receiving, making the moves and making the plays.

Although some records suggest that chickens were raised around 3200 BC, archaeological evidence only goes back to about 2000 BC. It is considered that chickens originate from India, and that the red jungle fowl is an ancestor to today\u2019s modern chicken. The breeding of chickens in captivity dates back to at least 1400 BC in Egypt. But intensive poultry production only\u0026nbsp; before 7500 BCE. Chickens were brought to Sumer In Thebes, Egypt, the tomb of Haremhab, built about 1420 BCE, shows a depiction of a man carrying bowls of ostrich eggs and other large eggs,\u0026nbsp; arrived in Greece around 800 BCE, where the quail had been the primary source of eggs IN ancient Rome, eggs were preserved using a number of methods, and meals often started with an egg course The dried egg industry developed in the 19th century, before the rise of the frozen egg industry. In 1878, a company in St. Louis, Missouri started to transform egg yolk and white into a light-brown, meal-like substance by using a drying process.\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;intensive poultry production only began in the 20th century. Indeed, the past 100 years have seen an impressive growth, chiefly in the production of chickens and eggs, turkeys, ducks, and geese. It is the advent of vaccination for conditions such as Marek\u2019s disease, in addition to preproducing good quality day-old chicks starts with the breeder flock. Not only is the quality of the egg important, but also the health and nutritional status of the breeders are having an impact on day-old markable improvements in nutrition, genetics, and management, that has allowed the poultry industry to quickly develop since the late 1960s\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; In general we can divide the factors associated with chick quality in two categories: EGG RELATED FACTORS hatchery and brooding management factors (egg handling , incubation, chick processing and placement SOURCES OF CHICKENS Primary breeding companies supply the breed performance These white hybrid layers are capable of laying 324 eggs per hen housed at 72 weeks of age with a feed conversion of 3.04 pounds of feed per dozen or 1.91 kg feed per kg of egg.der stock chickens for various breeder/hatchery companies who then supply the day-old pullet chicks to be grown into laying hens housing system feeding program in general\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;lighting program\u0026nbsp; economy of layer farm indices layer health management vaccination program suggested vaccination program spray vaccine onovo vaccine hatchary vaccine fowl pox vaccine cleaning disinfection receiving baby chicks\u0026nbsp; automation in layer farm egg collection manure removal flock following rearing table postmortem\u0026nbsp; procedures serology how to take blood sample how to make Elisa test\u0026nbsp; Elisa software\u003C/p\u003E","language":"Ingl\u00E9s","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/master-layer-farm-management-the-business-of-millionaires/","imageUri":"https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4355500_374e.jpg?secure=FukE0vl0fe6fY_eZv2om8A%3D%3D%2C1643565280","duration":"3 horas","enrolledStudentsCount":"1.003 estudiantes","lastUpdated":"Fecha de la \u00FAltima actualizaci\u00F3n: 11/2021","targetAudiences":["any one interested in poultry business","begginer in business world"],"tags":["Ense\u00F1anzas y disciplinas acad\u00E9micas","Otras ense\u00F1anzas y disciplinas acad\u00E9micas","Habilidades de gesti\u00F3n"],"rating":{"count":1,"averageValue":"1.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"Mohamed AL ashram","url":"/user/mohamed-taha-288/","totalNumberOfStudents":6053,"totalNumberOfReviews":27,"averageRating":3.573528459259259}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"805A69A67F019B117CFA","originalPrice":"5.760\u00A0\u20B9","discountedPrice":"Gratis","expirationText":"4 giorni","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/copywriting-secrets-masterclass/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":2966782,"title":"Copywriting Secrets Course \u2013 Become A PRO Copywriter Expert","shortDescription":"Copywriting Secrets proven Business success Tactics from the master.

Remark, who found the fungal nature of favus in 1837 Berg who reported oral candidiasis in 1841 Wilkinson, who described vaginal candidiasis in 1849. Tinea versicolor was described clinically in 1846 by Eichstaedt, and its etiologic agent was identified in 1853. Beigel reported white Piedra in 1856 Piedra, which means \u0022stone\u0022 in Spanish, is an asymptomatic superficial fungal infection of the hair shaft. In 1865, Beigel first described Piedra in The Human Hair: Its Structure, Growth, Diseases, and Their Treatment; although, he may have been describing Aspergillus infection. Cerqueira, tinea nigra in 1891 In 1910 Raymond Sabouraud published his book Les Teignes, which was a comprehensive study of dermatophytic fungi. He is also regarded as father of medical mycology. In 1927, Nan Nizzi reported the description of the sexual state of Microspore gypsum. In 1927, Nannizzi reported the description of the sexual state of Microsporum gypseum the taxonomy of yeast fungi was described by Lodder and Kregervan Rij in 1952. The current classification of dermatophytes was published by Emmons in 1934 Finally, Gentles\u0027 successful treatment of tinea capitis with griseofulvin by in 1958 saved many patients with tinea capitis from permanent hair loss a common side effect after treatment with thallium importance of fungi Fungi inhabit almost every niche in the environment and humans are exposed to these organisms in various fields of life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E LEARN Harmful Effects of Fungi: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

Beneficial Effects of Fungi: 1. Decomposition - nutrient and carbon recycling . 2. Biosynthetic factories. The fermentation property is used for the industrial production of alcohols, fats, citric, oxalic and gluconic acids. 3. Important sources of antibiotics, such as Penicillin. 4. Model organisms for biochemical and genetic studies. Eg: Neurospora crassa 5. Saccharomyces cerviciae is extensively used in recombinant DNA technology, which includes the Hepatitis B Vaccine . 6. Some fungi are edible (mushrooms). 7. Yeasts provide nutritional supplements such as vitamins and cofactors. 8. Penicillium is used to flavour Roquefort and Camembert cheeses. 9. Ergot produced by Claviceps purpurea contains medically important alkaloids that help in inducing uterine contractions, controlling bleeding and treating migraine. 10.

Despite the fact that the concept of neuroplasticity is quite new, it is one of the most important discoveries in neuroscience. The fact is that neural networks are not fixed, but occurring and disappearing dynamically throughout our whole life, depending on experiences. While we repeatedly practice one activity such as a sequence of movements or a mathematical problem, neuronal circuits are being formed, leading to better ability to perform the practiced task with less waste of energy. Once we stop practicing a certain activity, the brain will redirect these neuronal circuits by a much known \u0027use it or lose it\u2019 principle.

These and other cognitive functions are performed by the vastly interconnected neural networks formed by the roughly 100 billion neurons of the brain. The precise patterns of connectivity among neurons within these networks determines their function, and through experience, these connectivity patterns change over time to enable acquisition of new skills. Indeed, one of the most impressive aspects of brain function is the ability to learn new cognitive skills, such as the ability to understand and speak a foreign language. During learning, connections between neurons change through a process known as synaptic plasticity, which plays a pivotal role in learning, While traditional learning brings about changes in neural networks through experience, synaptic plasticity can also be enhanced by activating neuromodulatory regions in the brain via peripheral neurostimulation. This program seeks to use peripheral neurostimulation to facilitate the release of neurotransmitters associated with components of learning, such as acetylcholine, dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine. By combining peripheral neurostimulation with conventional training practices, we can leverage endogenous neuronal circuitry to enhance learning by accelerating the tuning of neural networks responsible for cognitive functions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERecent success with this approach has been demonstrated in clinical rehabilitation studies, utilizing peripheral neurostimulation delivered through implanted electrodes.
