Google uses Dart to develop many of its main applications including Ads which as you can imagine must require quite a solid build.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDart is very flexible in the way it is compiled and executed, it is in fact the only programming language capable of compiling JIT (Just In Time \u2014 used during development) and AOT (Ahead Of Time \u2014 used when the app is released), it can also be compiled to Javascript in order to be run by browsers or straight to native code. This means its execution is \u003Cem\u003Efast.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks to its versatility Dart can be used for client or server-side development. The syntax looks like \u2018C\u2019 meaning it is statically typed so this provides more certainty on the types of values you are passing on, but it is also meant to be used in OOP, if you have a background in C you\u2019ll pick it up quick. Dart also shares some similarities with Javascript like the use of arrows and asynchronous functions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u2019s not forget about \u2018hot reload\u2019.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can test your code like if it was HTML and you were refreshing the page to see the changes. Yes, it is that easy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDart has been slept on by the dev community for too long but I think its time is coming with the mobile-first principle that is gaining such massive momentum.
