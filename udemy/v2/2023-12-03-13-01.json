They are sequential in nature. You\u0026nbsp; need to do the Part 1 of the Module, before going to Part 2, etc. The importance of this is explained in the first Introduction video lecture of Part 1. Please kindly listen and follow according,\u0026nbsp; as it is designed to steadily and incrementally break down your internal resistance on money in the most effective way possible. Your resistance is very powerful and has been built up and refined over decades. So do not rush to the other courses Part 2, 3, 4, \u0026amp; 5 in the Module. You\u0026nbsp; will simply not get the benefit of the entire 5-Part course Module.\u0026nbsp; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is important to follow the sequence so that you\u0026nbsp; can put yourself on the path to success and wealth creation as quickly and efficiently as possible. Yet in a genuine way with real effect and change. Mastering your Self in the wrong way has taken a lifetime, so its only natural that it will take at least a few weeks to press the reset button. This is not an overnight success.
