We cannot remember all the information all the time. Note-making is quite useful to students. At the time of examinations, it is not possible for the students to go through voluminous books. At that time, notes are quite helpful to them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote Making is a way of recording important details from a source. This source can be any paragraph, passage, book, article, meeting or any oral discussion. We have to read the passage carefully from beginning to end and find out the suitable title for the passage. Avoid using long sentence as heading or title.\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;Underlining the important sentences helps us to make headings and subheadings.\u0026nbsp; Heads and subheadings are to be numbered.\u0026nbsp; All the points are to be given a logical sequence.\u0026nbsp; Do not change the idea of message of the passage.\u0026nbsp; We should be brief, clear and specific.
