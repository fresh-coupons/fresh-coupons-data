There is a lot to get into when we are talking about building a project of this size, of course. So if you learned PHP, MySQL a little bit of PDO, and Bootstrap and want to train your skills you are in the right place. You are going to be exposed to a lot of different parts of web development areas and techniques and so on. This should be a rich experience for you if you are stuck with tutorials and do not know when to start when building projects.
