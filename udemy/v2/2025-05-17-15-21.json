I also included the files needed in different parts of the course for you to follow along with me step by step.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EHere is what you are going to learn, first of all, I am going to introduce you to the tools that we are going to be using in this course. And then we are going to build a full authentication system from scratch. While building this system I am going to introduce you to hashing and dehashing passwords. And then, we are going to build general and cool features inside our own app. It\u0027s going to be mainly on selecting and placing data. Right after this, we are going to work with genres and shows and we will build our following system to allow users to follow their new shows\u0027 updates. And then, we are going to let users comment and view episodes of the show and we are going to build our own views counter. We are going to finish the users\u0027 end by allowing users to view their followed shows and we are going to work with the search box. And now to the admins panel where we are going to let admins manage the web app by working with admins, episodes, shows, genres and more. Of course, there are a lot of things and functionlites to talk about in this course but I don\u0027t want to waste any more of your time.

The CRISPR-Cas9 system consists of two key molecules that introduce a change (mutation) into the DNA. These are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u2981\tan enzyme called Cas9. This acts as a pair of \u2018molecular scissors\u2019 that can cut the two strands of DNA at a specific location in the genome so that bits of DNA can then be added or removed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u2981\ta piece of RNA called guide RNA (gRNA). This consists of a small piece of pre-designed RNA sequence located within a longer RNA scaffold. The scaffold part binds to DNA and the pre-designed sequence \u2018guides\u2019 Cas9 to the right part of the genome. This makes sure that the Cas9 enzyme cuts at the right point in the genome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The guide RNA is designed to find and bind to a specific sequence in the DNA. The guide RNA has RNA bases that are complementary to those of the target DNA sequence in the genome. This means that, at least in theory, the guide RNA will only bind to the target sequence and no other regions of the genome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. The Cas9 follows the guide RNA to the same location in the DNA sequence and makes a cut across both strands of the DNA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. At this stage the cell recognizes that the DNA is damaged and tries to repair it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5.
