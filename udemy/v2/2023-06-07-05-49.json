This course is a comprehensive project based course where you will be fully guided step by step on how to build metaverse projects without having to write a single line of code. In the introduction session, you will be introduced to the basic fundamentals of metaverse, technologies behind metaverse, as well as some metaverse project ideas to build. Then, once you got into the project, you will extensively learn how to utilise three metaverse builder tools, the first one is Blockade Labs which is text to metaverse AI generator where you will be able to input text prompts and Blockade Labs will be able to generate you a 3D metaverse virtual reality space based on the given prompt. So, it is extremely similar to Midjourney or Stable Diffusion, the only difference here is Blockade Labs generates a 3D metaverse space instead of arts or images. Meanwhile, the second one is Metaverses IO which is no code builder platform where you can easily customise free metaverse template to build your own space, you will be guided step by step on how to use all features available on this platform as well as building and designing several interesting metaverse projects to make yourself more familiar with this tool. Lastly, the third metaverse builder tool that you will learn is Spatial IO which is actually pretty similar to Metaverse IO when it comes to features and functionalities, but Spatial IO concentrates more on virtual space design. Once all the metaverse projects have been built, we will continue by conducting testing to make sure the metaverse is comfortable to be used, easy to navigate from the perspectives of the user. Last but not least, the course will be ended by sharing several strategies that can be implemented to potentially monetise metaverse as well as some metaverse based business models you can consider to start.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, before getting into the course, we need to ask ourselves these questions: why should we learn about the metaverse? Why should we build a metaverse? I don\u2019t know about you but to me, it really seems that we are slowly moving and transforming into that direction as more and more companies starting to implement work from home policy, more and more schools, colleges, universities starting to offer online classes, and in overall, like it or not, the time we spend online in most cases is way longer compared to the time we spend offline. Therefore, by knowing and understanding how to build a metaverse, you will not only get a high demand skill set in today\u2019s economy but also you will be able to innovate your own product to fill the gap in the market. In addition to that, oftentimes people see metaverse as the main product, even though it is actually not, metaverse is simply just a platform or place to be on, just like social media, and let the people inside do what they want to do there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow are things you can expect to learn from this course:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn the basic fundamentals of metaverse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn the technologies behind metaverse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to use Blockade Labs and Skybox AI to generate metaverse background from text prompt\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to use Metaverses IO to build and customise a metaverse template\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to use Spatial IO to build metaverse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to customise avatar on Spatial IO\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to build a metaverse cinema\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to build a metaverse art gallery\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to add 3D objects to the metaverse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn several different ways to monetise metaverse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/metaverse-architect-building-virtual-space-with-no-code/","imageUri":"https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5361398_a6cd_2.jpg","duration":"2.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"55.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["People who are interested in building metaverse without code","People who are interested in creating virtual space to to hold virtual events"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":0,"averageValue":"0.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"Christ Raharja","url":"/user/christ-raharja/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":0}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"11B086051707D05EDBA7","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/leadership-voice-coaching/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":1474252,"title":"Voice Training - Vocal Coaching for Effective Leadership","shortDescription":"7 Minutes a Day to Communication Mastery with Proven Voice Training","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECommunicate like a LEADER.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EResearch proves that the greatest impact speakers have in any conversation comes not only from the words they say but from the sound of their voices.

It assumes that you\u0027re new to the language, so it gets you started with basic functionality such as creating functions, creating variables, and calling these lines of code from your standard HTML pages. It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM).

The primary focus of PEP 8 is to improve the readability and consistency of Python code.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPEP 8 exists to improve the readability of Python code. But why is readability so important? Why is writing readable code one of the guiding principles of the Python language?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs Guido van Rossum said, \u003Cstrong\u003E\u201CCode is read much more often than it is written.\u201D \u003C/strong\u003EYou may spend a few minutes, or a whole day, writing a piece of code to process user authentication. Once you\u2019ve written it, you\u2019re never going to write it again. But you\u2019ll definitely have to read it again. That piece of code might remain part of a project you\u2019re working on. Every time you go back to that file, you\u2019ll have to remember what that code does and why you wrote it, so readability matters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u2019re new to Python, \u003Cstrong\u003Eit can be difficult to remember what a piece of code does a few days, or weeks, after you wrote it\u003C/strong\u003E. If you follow PEP 8, you can be sure that you\u2019ve named your variables well. You\u2019ll know that you\u2019ve added enough whitespace so it\u2019s easier to follow logical steps in your code. You\u2019ll also have commented your code well. All this will mean your code is more readable and easier to come back to. As a beginner, following the rules of PEP 8 can make learning Python a much more pleasant task.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFollowing PEP 8 is particularly important if you\u2019re looking for a development job.\u003C/strong\u003E Writing clear, readable code shows professionalism.

Writing readable code here is crucial. Other people, who may have never met you or seen your coding style before, will have to read and understand your code.

A shell is the interactive prompt that appears when Linux boots up. It\u0027s also where users can enter commands to manage their systems. Linux administrators use bash scripting to speed up their work and make it more efficient. They can automate tasks, inspect and modify the system, and much more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBash enables Linux administrators to perform complex tasks quickly and easily. For example, network configuration files can be edited with ease using a text editor. Then those edits can be saved as a shell script for further modification or backup purposes. Bash also makes it easy to check system resources such as memory and storage space. Plus, it can be used for automated system maintenance such as stopping services, removing unwanted files.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBash scripting makes it easy to keep your Linux system secure and up-to-date with security patches and software updates. Most of these updates involve fixing bugs or adding new features to the system\u0027s core applications and libraries. Administrators can run scheduled updates and check for problems along the way via a cron job or other program tools. In addition, all security patches are automatically applied via automated scripts without any user intervention required. As a result, your system stays secure regardless of who\u0027s handling your server\u0027s update process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBash is an essential part of any professional Linux environment management strategy.
