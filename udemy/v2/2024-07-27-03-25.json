He makes every other course seem like a prologue and I know I am going to be the confident, well prepared speaker that I always sought to become. The magnitude of material and the pieces of golden wisdom are so practical to today\u0027s environment. It hardly seems possible that a teacher of this quality would be so giving and available to the average person like myself, when he is qualified to coach Kings and Dignitaries. Only one-third through the course and already my Charity fundraising efforts are more effective because I have gained skills to improve my communication, both my message and my delivery. The clarity of TJ Walker\u0027s delivery demonstrates his message in action. Follow him on Facebook and YouTube for greater depth if you find yourself improving from absorbing his work as I have. Do the assignments promptly and you will improve with each session. Worth the investment of time and that is what I value most, TJ WALKER delivered value with each session, and made the most of my time.\u0022\u0026nbsp;Debbie Tudor\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat others say about the instructor:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u201CTJ Walker\u0027s single-minded devotion to presentation has made him the #1 expert for executives seeking guidance on speaking to the public and media.\u0022 \u003Cem\u003EBob Bowdon, Anchor/Reporter, Bloomberg Television\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u201CTJ Walker is the leading media trainer in the world.\u0022 \u003Cem\u003EStu Miller, Viacom News Producer\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(TJ Walker\u0027s Media Training Worldwide) \u201CThe world\u0027s leading presentation and media training firm.\u0022\u003Cem\u003EGregg Jarrett, Fox News Channel Anchor\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/how-to-deliver-an-elevator-pitch/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/364026_36eb_2.jpg","duration":"10 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"27,404.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Entrepreneurs ","Job seekers","Executives"],"tags":["Communication Skills","Investor Pitching","Personal Branding"],"rating":{"count":195,"averageValue":"4.3"},"instructors":[{"name":"TJ Walker","url":"/user/tjwalker2/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.2},{"name":"Media Training Worldwide Digital","url":"/user/media-training-worldwide-digital/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.2}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"C17429D1EE67E49662F8","originalPrice":"\u20B92,299","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/public-speaking-for-college-students/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":363942,"title":"Public Speaking for College Students: Become a Great Speaker","shortDescription":"Public speaking may be the single most important skill for long-term success and you are unlikely to learn it in college","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp; \tImagine speaking to a classroom or even an auditorium full of students knowing that everyone understands you, remembers your key messages and feels you are a confident speaker.

So he is giving us an actual example of the very thing that he is talking about. His expressions and gestures are perfectly suited to the points he is making. And his pronunciation is very clear and easy to understand. Also his sentences are spoken with the emphasis in the right places. This course is designed for native speakers of English. The same basic principles could probably be applied in a course designed for non-native speakers. I would like to see such a course someday. I am really enjoying this course.

We will enter common adjusting entries into an adjusting entry Excel worksheet and into Quickbooks. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe course will then compare and contrast our different bookkeeping methods and show how those different bookkeeping decisions reconcile to the same numbers after the adjusting entry process. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, we will discuss whether or not to enter the year-end adjusting entries into our QuickBooks bookkeeping system and different options to do so. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to the instructional videos, this course will include downloadable\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u2022\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; QuickBooks Backup files\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u2022\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Excel practice files\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u2022\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Downloadable PDF Files\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe QuickBooks backup files are a great tool that allows us to jump ahead in the material or to rework material if we choose. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExcel practice files will be preformatted and will generally have at least two tabs, one tab with the completed work and a second tab with a preformatted worksheet we can fill in as we watch the instructional videos.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWho will we be learning from?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou will be learning from somebody who has technical experience in accounting concepts and in accounting software like QuickBooks, as well as experience teaching and putting together curriculum.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou will be learning from somebody who is a:\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u2022\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; CPA \u2013 Certified Public Accountant\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u2022\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; CGMA \u2013 Chartered Global Management Accountant\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u2022\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Master of Science in Taxation\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u2022\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; CPS \u2013 Certifies Post-Secondary Instructor\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u2022\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Curriculum Development Export\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a practicing CPA the instructor has worked with many technical accounting issues and helped work through them and discuss them with clients of all levels.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a CPA and professor, the instructor has taught many accounting classes and worked with many students in the fields of accounting, business, and business applications.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe instructor also has a lot of experience designing courses and learning how students learn best and how to help students achieve their objectives.

Merger: Two companies of relatively similar size combine forces to create a new, single entity. This is often a move for market expansion or gaining a competitive edge.  Acquisition: One company purchases a majority stake or all of another company. The acquiring company gains control of the acquired company\u0027s assets and operations. This can be done to enter new markets, eliminate competition, or gain new technology resources.","Key Pitfalls in M\u0026A  Culture Clash: Combining distinct company cultures can lead to employee conflicts, low morale, and a decline in productivity.  Overpaying: Enthusiasm can lead companies to overpay for an acquisition, resulting in financial losses down the line.  Poor Integration: Failure to smoothly integrate systems, processes, and teams creates operational chaos and hinders the potential of the combined entity.  Lack of Due Diligence: Insufficient research about the target company\u0027s financial health, legal standing, or market position might expose hidden liabilities and risks.  Loss of Focus: The complexity of the M\u0026A process can distract from core business operations, leading to neglected customers or missed opportunities.","Why is Learning About M\u0026A Important for Companies and Managers?  Strategic Growth: M\u0026A can be a powerful tool to expand into new markets, acquire new technologies, eliminate competitors, or increase market share significantly.

Broader Skillset: M\u0026A involves exposure to various aspects of business such as finance, valuation, negotiation, and legal, thus developing a more versatile skillset.
