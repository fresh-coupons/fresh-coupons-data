It assumes that you\u0027re new to the language, so it gets you started with basic functionality such as creating functions, creating variables, and calling these lines of code from your standard HTML pages. It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E* Javascript Course Contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Introduction\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Array\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Variables\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Functions\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Objects\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Control Statements\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Cookies\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Loop statements\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Data Structures\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Error Handling\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Regular Expressions\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESee you inside the course\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-for-beginners-complete-course/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4200368_f71e_5.jpg","duration":"2 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"85,124.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["For Javascript  Programming Beginners","For People New to Javascript","For People Who want to learn Javascript Fundamentals and later Transition into Web Development"],"tags":["JavaScript"],"rating":{"count":944,"averageValue":"4.2"},"instructors":[{"name":"PROPER DOT INSTITUTE","url":"/user/vivek-dahibhate-2/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.2166667}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"C1BBA21E4517E1BE473D","originalPrice":"\u20B91,299","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"3 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/cold-email-templates-guide-how-to-get-customers-using-email-tareq-hajj/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5196632,"title":"Cold Email Templates Guide: How to Get Customers Using Email","shortDescription":"Get the Proven Cold Email Templates Which Will Help You Get More Customers","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EAre you looking for new ways to generate leads?

The focus of the course will be on four key services, including: Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), AWS Storage Solutions, and Elastic Load Balancers (ELB) integrated with Auto Scaling Groups (ASG). \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAmazon EC2 is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It allows users to launch virtual machines (VMs) on demand and pay only for the compute resources they use. In this course, we will explore the different types of instances available, as well as how to launch, configure, and manage EC2 instances.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn addition to the EC2 service, we also explore AWS storage solutions including Elastic Block Store (EBS), Elastic File System (EFS), Snapshots, and Amazon Machine Images (AMIs). EBS is a block-level storage service for use with EC2 instances. It provides persistent storage for data that needs to be frequently accessed. EFS is a file-level storage service for use with EC2 instances. It allows users to create and configure file systems that can be accessed from multiple instances. Snapshots are point-in-time copies of EBS volumes that can be used for backup and recovery. AMIs are pre-configured virtual machine images that can be used to launch EC2 instances. In this course, we will explore the different storage options available and how to use them to manage data on the AWS platform.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOnce students have a handle on the foundations, we explore more intermediate topics relevant to workload distribution through the integration of ELBs and ASGs. Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs) are used to distribute incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances. They automatically scale to handle incoming traffic and can also be used to improve availability and fault tolerance. In this course, we will explore the different types of load balancers available, as well as how to configure and use them to distribute traffic across multiple instances.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWe will demonstrate how to integrate the ELBs with Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs) to ensure workloads are only distributed to healthy nodes within the EC2 service. ASGs allow users to automatically scale the number of EC2 instances in response to changing demand. They automatically launch and terminate instances based on predefined rules, ensuring that the number of instances is always sufficient to handle incoming traffic. In this course, we will explore how to configure and use ASGs to automatically scale the number of instances on the AWS platform.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThroughout the course, we will use hands-on exercises to help students gain practical experience with the AWS platform. Students will have the opportunity to launch and configure EC2 instances, create and manage storage volumes, configure load balancers and auto scaling groups, and work with other AWS services. By the end of the course, students will have a solid understanding of the AWS platform and will be able to use it to build scalable and reliable cloud-based applications.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-elastic-load-balancing-with-auto-scaling-groups/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4925158_0612.jpg","duration":"8 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"7,097.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Students interested in learning the foundations of AWS","Students interested in Cloud Computing","Students interested in exploring the Amazon EC2 Service","Students interested in exploring various EC2 Storage Solutions (EFS, EBS)","Students interested in setting up Highly Available cloud setups using ELBs, and ASGs on AWS"],"tags":["Cloud Computing","Amazon Elastic Block Store","AWS Elastic Load Balancing"],"rating":{"count":33,"averageValue":"4.4"},"instructors":[{"name":"YouAccel Training","url":"/user/youaccel/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.467742}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"YOUACCEL97668","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"2 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/net-reverse-engineering/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4597988,"title":"Reverse Engineering .NET For Beginners (Visual Basic)","shortDescription":"Learn Reverse Engineering .NET Applications / Program \u0026 Making Their Activator - From Zero To Hero","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EIn This Course , You Will Learn \u003Cstrong\u003E.NET Reverse Engineering\u003C/strong\u003E From Beginning.

In this course you will learn to harness the power of JavaScript, XML, AJAX, and React to build highly interactive web pages from scratch. We start with an introduction into the document object model, followed by an in-depth guide to the essentials of JavaScript. In the JavaScript section you will learn a number of concepts instrumental towards your journey as a developer. This includes working with variables, arithmetic operators, objects, functions, arrays, events, and loops. You will also learn the importance of JavaScript placement, while working with both internal and external JavaScript code components. Students learn the importance of operator precedence when performing simple and complex arithmetic operations. Furthermore, you will have the opportunity to work with conditional statements to perform comparisons between different operations. Once you have a handle on the foundations, we\u2019ll dive into a number of JavaScript development projects where you will have an opportunity to apply your new skills with practical hands-on exercises. This includes building an automated background color changer, and photo gallery complete with mouse overs and image transitions.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn the second section of the course we will explore XML and AJAX to demonstrate the power of asynchronous page updates. This means building web components that automatically update on a web page, without having to manually refresh. You will have an opportunity to work with both XML and AJAX in conjunction with JavaScript to build modern web app components such as a search suggest feature, and a pre-populated select menu.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOnce you have a foundational understanding of JavaScript and AJAX, we will dive into working with React, a powerful JavaScript library used for front-end UI development. The React section starts off with a hands-on project where you\u2019ll learn how to work with functional React components, props, Callback functions, OnClick Events, and the React State hook to build a fully functional calculator. From there we will dive into project number two, where you will build a connect-4 clone. Here we will cover more intermediate concepts including passing props, de-structuring, passing arguments to click events, various styling methods, and handling callbacks. You will also learn about the React key property, React lifecycle events, and conditional rendering. By the end you will have built a complete multi and single player connect-4 game board with built-in AI capabilities. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn the final section of the course we further unleash the power of React by building out a complete e-commerce site with multiple product categories, a product showcase, shopping cart feature, and much more. Here, we introduce a number of integral new concepts including: JSON server, Fetch API, and installing React router. These essential building blocks will be used to render the product categories, style the product list, and configure the product details page. From there we dive into styled components, refactoring the shop layout, and exploring the concept of \u201Ccontext\u201D in React. In the final stages of the project students will configure the shopping cart basket, and the checkout feature. We will also implement a product search feature, followed by in-depth exercises on validating input forms in React.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAs you can see this course covers a tremendous bit of ground. Best of all it\u2019s co-authored by Tim Maclachlan - a renowned senior full-stack developer with over 20 years of commercial development experience.

Build an E-Commerce Site, Calculator, and Connect4 Game.","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the Complete React Certification course. This course offers a comprehensive guide into one of the most powerful, modern JavaScript libraries available - ReactJS. Whether you are completely new to React, or you\u2019ve dabbled with it in the past, one thing\u2019s for sure - You\u2019ve likely interacted with a number of web applications that use the React library for building out user interface components. Some of the most well known examples include Netflix, Facebook, and Airbnb. Developed and maintained by Meta along with a community of independent developers, React remains free and open-source. React is a component based library built entirely on JavaScript, which makes it perfect for designing complex UI\u2019s. With React, developers can build encapsulated components that efficiently manage their own state and render UI updates specifically when data changes. For example, think of the automated content refresh feature you see on a twitter feed, or Facebook like button. Here, the state of the UI component changes on the page without having to manually refresh when the data is updated. This is just one small, yet powerful UI feature built into React.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThis course starts with exploring the foundations of React and its core use cases. We offer a concise definition of what React is and what it\u2019s not. From there, we explore the tools needed to get started along with an introduction into JSX, and Functional React components. Through a complete hands-on project you will learn a number of important concepts including react props, callbacks, OnClick Events and passing parameters within callback functions. By the end of module one you will have built a fully functional calculator, complete with display and numerical operators. We will also cover important topics such as the React State Hook, and Debugging.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn the second module students build out a multiplayer Connect-4 clone, with AI integration. Here we start with styling the individual game board components followed by advanced onClickEvents. This includes global, dynamic and inline styling. From there, we move on to passing props, destructing, and React children. Students will explore the React key property, along with Lifecycle events, game initialization, CSS variables, and conditional rendering. By the end, you will have built a complete Connect-4 game capable of automatically determining the winner in both a multi-player and AI based single player setting.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn module three we further unleash the power of React by building out a complete e-commerce site with multiple product categories, a product showcase, shopping cart feature, and much more. Here, we introduce a number of integral new concepts including: JSON server, Fetch API, and installing React router. These essential building blocks will be used to render the product categories, style the product list, and configure the product details page. From there we dive into styled components, refactoring the shop layout, and exploring the concept of \u201Ccontext\u201D in React. In the final stages of the project students will configure the shopping cart basket, and the integrated checkout feature. We will also implement a product search feature, followed by in-depth exercises on validating input forms in React.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAs you can see this course covers a tremendous bit of ground. Best of all it\u2019s authored by Tim Maclachlan - a renowned senior full-stack developer with over 20 years of commercial development experience. As a multi-faceted developer, Tim\u2019s core competencies include algorithmic, analytical and mobile development. To date, he\u2019s written hundreds of applications and worked in a number of industries from commercial aviation and military, to banking and finance. Tim has a genuine passion for teaching others how to become better coders and looks forward to interacting with his students.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWith that said, we hope you\u2019re just as excited about this course as we are, if so - hit the enroll button and let\u2019s get started.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/react-complete-developer-course-with-hands-on-projects/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4779652_766f_3.jpg","duration":"10.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"28,007.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Students interested in learning to Build Web Apps using React","Students interested in using JavaScript libraries for Building our Functional UI Components.","Students interested in interactive front-end development using React"],"tags":["React JS"],"rating":{"count":167,"averageValue":"4.3"},"instructors":[{"name":"YouAccel Training","url":"/user/youaccel/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.275862}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"YOUACCEL97668","originalPrice":"\u20B92,299","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"2 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/ccie-security/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5317600,"title":"CCIE Security v6.0, by dr Jonas Birch","shortDescription":"CCIE Security - Learn to master the art of firewalls and network security.

However, it\u0027s been in the past couple of years that 3D animation has risen to the top. Just look at all the movies that were nominated this year for an Academy Award and you\u0027ll see that most, if not all of them, are 3D. If you think about all those movies, for example, \u0022Life of Pi\u0022, \u0022Hugo\u0022, and \u0022Hayao Miyazaki\u0027s\u0022 movies (\u0022The Wind Rises\u0022 and \u0022Ponyo\u0022), they were all done in 3D.

It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables.
