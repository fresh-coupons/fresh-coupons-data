He\u0027s spot on regarding messaging (refining the three points you need to make) and how to prepare on short notice. Between the training videos and the PDF books included in the course, it\u0027s invaluable -- and affordable for just about anyone. I took a media training course in NYC which required me to fly in for three entire weekends over the course of three consecutive months; TJ Walker covered essentially the same content right here. I\u0027ve worked in radio/television as a producer/host and I\u0027ve been interviewed by national media outlets from Good Morning America to the New York Times, so I\u0027m picky; and I\u0027m typically critical of those I see out there passing themselves off as media training experts, especially since I do media training (on a much smaller scale) myself. TJ Walker is the real deal. Though the production values aren\u0027t high end and the lighting/background could use some tweaking, the content itself is top-notch. Whether you have only two hours or up to two days before your interview, you\u0027ll have a significantly better chance of success by investing part of that time in taking this\u0022 \u003C/em\u003ELinda Lowen\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u0027\u0027I faced a lot of tvs, Radio, and Phone interviews in recent months.

It assumes that you\u0027re new to the language, so it gets you started with basic functionality such as creating functions, creating variables, and calling these lines of code from your standard HTML pages. It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are practicals of:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E* Javascript Course Contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Array\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Variables\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Functions\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Objects\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Control Statements\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Cookies\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Loop statements\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESee you inside the course\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-practicals-crash-course/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4200228_c917_2.jpg","duration":"38 total mins","enrolledStudentsCount":"133,051.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["For Javascript  Programming Beginners","For People New to Javascript","For People Who want to learn Javascript Fundamentals and later Transition into Web Development"],"tags":["JavaScript"],"rating":{"count":1911,"averageValue":"4.3"},"instructors":[{"name":"PROPER DOT INSTITUTE","url":"/user/vivek-dahibhate-2/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.25}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"964DCAFFA069632961E7","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/data-quality-data-management-data-governance-certificate/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":6406727,"title":"Data Quality, Data Management \u0026 Data Governance Certificate","shortDescription":"The Complete Guide to Data Quality, Management \u0026 Governance for better business decisions, efficiency, and compliance.","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWelcome to Program: Data Quality, Management and Governance by MTF Institute\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECourse provided by \u003Cstrong\u003EMTF Institute of Management, Technology and Finance\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMTF\u003C/strong\u003E is the global educational and research institute with HQ at Lisbon, Portugal, focused on business \u0026amp;

While biologists have made great strides in discovering things on Earth, there are still many new things to learn. The first fundamental questions are: What is Life? What does it mean to have life? These inquiries are essential to the discoveries that biologists find every day. With such a vast scope of information, biologists must organize these discoveries that will stand the test of time. In this unit, we introduce the major topics that biologists study and the theories they use and apply to their work\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EBasic Chemistry\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENature is not based on one field of study. It incorporates biology, physics, chemistry, and other academic disciplines. Life is multidisciplinary and is driven by chemical processes. Since so many biology topics overlap with basic principles of chemistry, you need a basic understanding and appreciation of chemistry to fully understand biology. For example, in Unit 1, we discussed that the atom is the first part of the biological hierarchy. In this unit, we provide an understanding of this foundational level of organization.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBiological Molecules\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBiological molecules are the essential molecules needed for life. These molecules can be organic or inorganic. Organic chemistry is the study of carbon, which is an element that forms strong covalent bonds essential for the foundational structures of all living things. Water, salts, acids, and bases are mostly essential inorganic molecules that facilitate many biological processes. All organisms contain organic biological molecules \u2013 carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and nucleic acid \u2013 that are essential to life. This unit will help you understand the structures and functions of these organic molecules and how our body needs them to function properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003ECells and Cell Membranes\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECells are the smallest units of life. In this unit, we explore the characteristics, components, and functions of cells. Learning about the structures of cells allows us to see the similarities and differences among organisms. Bacteria, plant, animal, and fungus cells are similar in many ways and contain many of the same small structures known as organelles. However, some characteristics help distinguish whether a cell belongs to an animal, plant, fungus, or bacteria. For example, all plant cells contain cell walls, while animal cells lack this particular extracellular structure. The water within a cell that presses against the cell wall gives a plant its rigidity and your celery its crunch!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eclassification\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClassification is a fundamental concept in biology.

Where does all that biomass come from? How does it get the energy to grow? Photosynthesis is the fascinating process plants use to convert light energy to chemical energy.

Cellular division is divided into two phases: mitosis and cytokinesis. Mitosis involves the division of the nuclear chromosomes, while cytokinesis is the division of the cytoplasmic components into new daughter cells. Serious consequences, such as cancer, can occur if this cell cycle is disrupted in some way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003ECellular Reproduction: Meiosis\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeiosis is a specialized type of cellular reproduction that only occurs in the ovaries and testes and results in an egg or sperm, respectively.
