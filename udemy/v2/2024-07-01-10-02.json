This is a comprehensive project-based course where you will learn step-by-step how to perform advanced text mining techniques using natural language processing. Additionally, you will also build an optical character recognition system using several Python libraries like EasyOCR and Tesseract. The OCR system will have the capability of extracting text from various document types and images. This course perfectly combines text mining with computer vision, providing an ideal opportunity to practice your programming skills by building complex projects with real-world applications. In the introduction session, you will learn the basic fundamentals of text mining and optical character recognition, such as getting to know their use cases, how those technologies work, technical challenges and limitations. Then, in the next session, we will download text datasets from Kaggle, the data will contain hundreds or even thousands of unstructured text. Before starting the project, we will learn about basic text mining techniques like tokenization, stopwords removal, stemming, lemmatization, and text normalization. This section is very important as it provides you with a basic understanding of text mining. Afterward, we will start the project section, for text mining, we will have eight projects, in the first project, we will build named entity recognition system for news article, in the second project, we will create topic modeling system for academic research, in the third project, we will create news article classification and categorization using TF-IDF, in the fourth project, we will build text summarization system for research paper, in the fifth project, we will create keyword extraction system for searching engine optimization tool, in the sixth project, we will perform sentiment analysis on product review, in the seventh project, we will build plagiarism detection tool, and in the last project, we will create spam email classification system. In the next section, we will learn basic techniques required for OCR like image processing and region of interest identification. Meanwhile, for OCR, we will have three projects, in the first project, we will build a car license plate recognition system, in the second project, we will create a handwriting recognition system, and in the last project, we will build a receipts scanner system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, before getting into the course, we need to ask ourselves this question: why should we learn about text mining and optical character recognition? Well, here is my answer: Text mining and optical character recognition are essential for transforming unstructured text data into valuable insights, enabling businesses and researchers to analyze and interpret vast amounts of information efficiently. These technologies play a crucial role in automating data extraction and analysis processes, reducing manual effort and increasing accuracy. Additionally, in fields such as healthcare, finance, and legal, text mining and OCR are indispensable for managing large volumes of documents, extracting relevant information, and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements. Moreover, by mastering these techniques, we equip ourselves with the skills needed to develop advanced data-driven applications, ultimately enhancing our ability to solve complex real-world problems through data science and artificial intelligence\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow are things that you can expect to learn from this course:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn the basic fundamentals of text mining and its use cases\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn the basic fundamentals of optical character recognition and its use cases\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how text mining works.

The Django Software Foundation (DSF) is in charge of maintaining it as a free and open-source framework. The primary objective of Django is to simplify the development process of complex, database-driven websites.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA framework, in general, is a set of pre-written code and tools that provide a structure for building applications. It offers a foundation and common functionalities, allowing developers to focus on application-specific logic rather than dealing with low-level details. Django provides numerous built-in features and libraries that assist in handling common web development tasks, such as URL routing, form handling, authentication, and database management.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are several reasons why developers choose Django for web development. Firstly, Django emphasizes the concept of \u0022batteries included,\u0022 meaning it comes with a wide range of ready-to-use components, reducing the need for external libraries. This saves development time and effort. Additionally, Django promotes the use of reusable code through its modular design, enabling developers to build applications quickly and efficiently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDjango can be used to develop both static and dynamic websites. For static websites, Django can serve as a content management system (CMS) where developers can easily manage and update the site\u0027s content. For dynamic websites, Django\u0027s MVT pattern plays a crucial role. The MVT architecture separates the application logic into three components:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModel: Represents the data structure and database schema. It defines the data models, relationships, and interactions with the database.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EView: Handles the business logic and acts as an intermediary between the model and the template. It processes requests, retrieves data from the model, and prepares it for rendering.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETemplate: Defines the presentation logic and represents the user interface.

Django\u0027s built-in ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) simplifies database operations, providing an intuitive way to interact with the database without writing complex SQL queries.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall, Django\u0027s robust features, scalability, security measures, and its supportive community make it an excellent choice for building large-scale, database-driven websites efficiently and effectively.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/python-tutorials-for-by-navinreddy/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/1793080_8158_3.jpg","duration":"14 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"117,894.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Beginners who want to get into software development, web development, machine learning"],"tags":["Python"],"rating":{"count":9299,"averageValue":"4.6"},"instructors":[{"name":"Navin Reddy","url":"/user/navinreddy2/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.550296}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"TELUSKO_JUNE","originalPrice":"\u20B93,499","discountedPrice":"\u20B9599","expirationText":"5 hours","discountPercentage":83}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/master-class-in-data-driven-marketing-management/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":6040612,"title":"Master Class in Data Driven Marketing Management","shortDescription":"Complete guide applicable to Data Driven Marketing strategies, advantages, challenges and data driven processes","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EDescription\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETake the next step in your career! \u003C/strong\u003EWhether you\u2019re an up-and-coming professional, an experienced executive, aspiring manager, budding Professional.
