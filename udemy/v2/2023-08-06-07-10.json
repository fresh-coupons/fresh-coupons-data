What used to be distinct areas of the department have been rolled up under one umbrella. The talent management team is responsible for recruiting, hiring, developing, and retaining employees.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERecruiters are the heavy lifters in building any company\u2019s workforce. They\u2019re responsible for the total hiring process including posting positions on job boards, sourcing candidates through job fairs and social media, serving as the first-line contacts for running background checks to screen candidates, conducting the initial interviews, and coordinating with the hiring manager responsible for making the final selection. A recruiter\u2019s success is determined by several key metrics: the number of positions they fill each year, where candidates are coming from (e.g., job postings, social media, career fairs, etc.), the time it takes to fill positions, and reasons why an applicant wasn\u2019t hired. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEmployee relations or support is the area of the talent management team that is concerned with strengthening the employer-employee relationship. Human resources managers in this role study job satisfaction, employee engagement, organizational culture, and resolving workplace conflict. Gallup estimates that disengaged employees cost U.S. businesses a whopping $600\u002B billion each year in lost productivity, so this role is integral to the success of your business.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the company has a unionized workforce, this team will also work on labor relations, including negotiating collective bargaining agreements, creating managerial responses to union organizing campaigns, and interpreting labor union contract questions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe talent management group is also home to HR practitioners who focus on workforce planning and management. This area includes succession planning and retention efforts across the business, from the C-suite on down. When an employee resigns, retires, is fired or laid off, gets sick, or dies, the workforce planning team kicks into action.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.\tCompensation and Benefits\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn smaller companies the compensation and benefits roles can often be overseen by one or two human resources professionals, but companies with a larger workforce will typically split up the duties. HR functions in compensation include evaluating the pay practices of competitors and establishing the compensation structure. The compensation department is also responsible for creating job descriptions in tandem with department managers, as well as working with talent management on succession planning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the benefits side, HR practitioners are typically responsible for functions such as negotiating group health coverage rates with insurance carriers or coordinating with the company\u2019s 401(k) administrator. Of course, payroll is also part of the compensation and benefits area of HR, but many companies choose to outsource this function to a bookkeeper or payroll service provider. Those that don\u2019t generally put payroll practitioners in a separate team that works on the tactical process of generating payroll, with the compensation team focusing mainly on planning and strategy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.\tTraining and Development\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEvery company wants to see its employees thrive, which means providing them with all the tools they need to succeed. These tools aren\u2019t necessarily physical such as laptops, job-related software, or tools for a particular trade; they can include new employee orientation, leadership training programs, personal and professional development, and managerial training. Training and development (sometimes called learning and development) is an integral part of the HR team. Depending on the type of employee role played at the company, the training team might be responsible for building out instructional programs that have a direct effect on the success of the business. Today, many colleges and universities offer degrees in training and development; an instructional design degree would also be helpful in this role.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.\tHR Compliance\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELegal and regulatory compliance is a critical component of any HR department. Employment and labor laws are highly complex, and having a team devoted to monitoring this ever-changing landscape is essential to keeping companies out of trouble with federal, state, and local governments\u2019 laws. When a business is out of compliance, it can result in applicants or employees filing claims based on discriminatory hiring and employment practices or hazardous working conditions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe HR compliance team is also heavily involved\u2014working in tandem with other HR practitioners\u2014in developing all company policy that makes up the employee handbook. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5.\tWorkplace Safety\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA large focus area for HR is developing and supporting safety training and maintaining federally mandated logs in the event injuries or fatalities happen at work.

Either you are preparing yourself to enter into the field of automotive service, or you are expanding your skills to include automotive electrical systems. In either case, congratulations on selecting one of the most fast-paced segments of the automotive industry. Working with the electrical systems can be challenging, yet very rewarding; however, it can also be very frustrating at times. For many people, learning electrical systems can be a struggle. It is my hope that I am able to present the course to you in such a manner that you will not only understand electrical systems, but will excel at it. There are many ways the theory of electricity can be explained, and many metaphors can be used. Some compare electricity to a water flow, while others explain it in a purely scientific fashion. Everyone learns differently. I am presenting electrical theory in a manner that I hope will be clear and concise. If you do not fully comprehend a concept, then it is important to discuss it with your instructor. Electricity is somewhat abstract; so if you do have questions, be sure to ask me in Udemy ask section.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy Become an Electrical System Technician? \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the past, it was possible for technicians to work their entire careers and be able to almost completely avoid the vehicle\u2019s electrical systems. They would specialize in engines, steering/ suspension, or brakes. Today, there is not a system on the vehicle that is immune to the role of electrical circuits. Engine controls, electronic suspension systems, and anti-lock brakes are common on today\u2019s vehicles. Even electrical systems that were once thought of as being simple have evolved to computer controls. Headlights are now pulse-width modulated using high side drivers and will automatically brighten and dim based on the light intensity of oncoming traffic. Today\u2019s vehicles are equipped with twenty or more computers, laser-guided cruise control, sonar park assist, infrared climate control, fiber optics, and radio frequency transponders and decoders. Simple systems have become more computers reliant. For example, the horn circuit on the 2008 Chrysler 300C involves three separate control modules to function. Even the tires have computers involved, with the addition of tire pressure monitoring systems!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday\u2019s technician must possess a full and complete electrical background to be able to succeed.

Whenever they dismantle something, they can reassemble it how it was. Whenever they say that they need to investigate the hood, they can really get the darn thing open. Furthermore, when they need to change a level, they don\u0027t endure ten minutes attempting to sort out which end of the raise is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFortunately, you don\u0027t need to be brought into the world with a wrench in your grasp to know how to fix things \u2014 even things as apparently convoluted as a vehicle.

All things considered, in the event that you couldn\u0027t actually sort out some way to open the hood, how might you check the oil or the coolant level? That is the reason I start this course with the essentials: straightforward positions that you\u0027ll have to do over and over \u2014 like opening the hood, lifting a vehicle, and replacing a tire. I likewise incorporate guidelines for filling the gas tank yourself (it\u0027s less expensive than full-administration), a reliable technique for dismantling anything and assembling it back once more, and security pointers that each technician \u2014 experienced and amateur \u2014 ought to notice.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/car-repair-auto-mechanic-training/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4624160_7f02_9.jpg","duration":"7.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"43,081.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Beginner Car Mechanics","Auto Mechanic Course Learners","Car Mechanic Training Course","Car Mechanic Training","Automotive Repair Training","Online Auto Mechanic Course","Auto Repair Class","Car Mechanic School"],"tags":["Car Repair"],"rating":{"count":774,"averageValue":"3.8"},"instructors":[{"name":"OCSALY Academy | 230.000\u002B Students","url":"/user/online-academy-of-computer-science/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.047244}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"ELECTRICIAN-TRAIN","originalPrice":"\u20B92,699","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/android-kotlin-development/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5088334,"title":"Android App Development in 34 Hours : MobDevOps\u002B Android 13","shortDescription":"You don\u0027t need 34\u002B hours for learning kotlin!

This course covers an extensive amount of material and by the end you will be proficient enough with AWS to gain an entry level position in cloud administration.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe curriculum starts off with exploring AWS account registration, billing and multi-factor authentication. We then explore more advanced account security through AWS identity and access management (IAM). IAM is an integral part of AWS that facilitates the management of users, groups, and security policies that control AWS resources. Here, we explore the creation of IAM users with varying degrees of account access. This includes user groups, permission policies, and IAM roles for EC2.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOnce students have a firm understanding of IAM, we dive into the backbone of AWS by exploring EC2 instance deployment and configuration. EC2 is a core service of AWS that facilitates the launch of virtual servers (called instances) within the AWS cloud console. We cover how to launch and configure EC2 instances, including choosing the right instance type and setting up security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic. We also explore remote instance administration using PuTTY and Terminal to issue server commands and manage instances from any remote location. Students learn to deploy and assign elastic IP addresses along with the creation of Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) to save instance state and quickly launch new instances with replicated configurations.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAfter completion of the EC2 module, we jump into AWS storage solutions where we explore various storage types including, block, file and object storage. More specifically students learn to harness the power of the Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) and the Amazon Elastic File System (EFS). We demonstrate how to deploy and configure multiple EBS volumes and attach them to existing instances for maximum scalability. Students also learn to design and deploy seamlessly scalable storage systems using EFS. We demonstrate how to mount multiple instances to a single EFS endpoint for centralized access to data files. We complete the module by showcasing the power of EBS snapshots and Amazon Machine Images for efficient instance deployment and backups.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EFrom this point, the course branches into more intermediate concepts by exploring elastic load balancing (ELB), Auto Scaling Groups (ASG), and Route 53. Student will learn to deploy a highly available architecture that auto scales based on real-time traffic workload and instance health checks. Traffic will be routed directly through Amazons Route 53 DNS service, with customized domain names and pre-configured hosted zones.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EBy the end of this course, you will have a solid understanding of how to use AWS to build and deploy your own cloud-based infrastructure. You will be able to launch and configure EC2 instances, store and manage data in the cloud, and use services like ELB and ASG to scale your infrastructure to meet the needs of your applications.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIf you\u0027re excited about expanding your knowledge in AWS and the field of cloud computing, hit the enroll button and let\u0027s get started.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-beginner-to-intermediate-ec2-iam-elb-asg-route-53/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5029488_f4fc_5.jpg","duration":"9.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"13,257.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Students interested in Cloud Computing with AWS","Students interested in learning the foundations of Amazon Web Services","Students interested in administering AWS accounts using Identity and Access Management (IAM)","Students interested in securing AWS accounts by assigning Access Privileges to IAM Users","Students interested in deploying Virtual Servers on AWS","Cloud Computing Enthusiasts looking to gain knowledge on using AWS","Students interested in learning about the Amazon EC2 Service","Students interested in learning various AWS Storage Solutions for EC2 (EBS, EFS)","Students interested in learning Dynamic Scaling, Elastic Load Balancing, and Auto Scaling Groups","Students interested in Managing Domain hosted zones using Amazon Route 53"],"tags":["Cloud Computing","Amazon EC2"],"rating":{"count":52,"averageValue":"4.4"},"instructors":[{"name":"YouAccel Training","url":"/user/youaccel/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.5}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"YOUACCEL28041","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"1 day","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-cypress/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":2853582,"title":"Cypress Basics","shortDescription":"Everything you need to know about Cypress Basics","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EHave you always wanted to learn how to do use Cypress but don\u2019t know where to start?\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould you like to Test apps with Cypress?\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen Cypress Basics is for you!\u0026nbsp; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHi, I\u2019m your instructor Josh Werner and I\u2019ll be leading you through this course.\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECypress is in-demand skill in 2022.\u0026nbsp; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe course begins with the basics.

To get a better idea of the possible demand for used cars in your area, you\u2019ll need to crunch some numbers. By knowing the number of used cars sold in your area every year and month , you can estimate what percentage of the market you will be likely to be able to corner and reach. By locating the average profit per vehicle, you can get an approximate idea of how much profit and money your dealership able to make per year. While the groundwork associated with opening a dealership can be time-consuming, expensive, and demanding, the real test of your dealership\u2019s viability doesn\u2019t begin until after you open your doors to the public. Without the right management of your dealership, all the effort you put into laying the foundation will be wasted. While each state has its own rules and regulations, there are several important universal aspects of operating a car dealership and tips on how you can get the most out of your investment. Your customers are the single most important factor in the success or failure of your business, so taking the time to identify who they are and what they care about is absolutely vital. Take a look at the types of cars you plan on selling, then do some research to determine the age, gender, and income level of the average individual who owns those types of vehicles. Later down the line, this will allow you to tailor your marketing and advertising efforts toward those who are most likely to be interested in what you have to offer.

The goal of computer forensics is to perform a structured investigation and maintain a documented chain of evidence to find out exactly what happened on a computing device and who was responsible for it. Computer forensics -- which is sometimes referred to as computer forensic science essentially is data recovery with legal compliance guidelines to make the information admissible in legal proceedings. The terms digital forensics and cyber forensics are often used as synonyms for computer forensics. Digital forensics starts with the collection of information in a way that maintains its integrity. Investigators then analyze the data or system to determine if it was changed, how it was changed and who made the changes. The use of computer forensics isn\u0027t always tied to a crime. The forensic process is also used as part of data recovery processes to gather data from a crashed server, failed drive, reformatted operating system (OS) or other situation where a system has unexpectedly stopped working.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy is computer forensics important?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the civil and criminal justice system, computer forensics helps ensure the integrity of digital evidence presented in court cases.
