This course delves deeper than just teaching you how to say a simple greeting or basic nouns, it actually aims to get you engaged and involved in speaking and writing in the language as soon as your first day through interactive video lessons and lectures, and resources only available to students in this course. In this course, you also won\u0027t be bogged down by overly complex technical lingo or terminologies, nor will you learn things that aren\u0027t applicable to most Spanish learners (as is often taught in a classroom setting). So whether you have no prior experience with Spanish, know a decent amount, or are just looking for a refresher, this is an essential course for you as it\u0027s made for those who want to actually get started on confidently holding conversations in\u0026nbsp;Spanish and feeling comfortable breaking through the barrier of their Spanish knowledge by going beyond rote memorization.
