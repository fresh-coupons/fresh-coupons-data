Linux is typically packaged in a Linux distribution. Distributions include the Linux kernel and supporting system software and libraries, many of which are provided by the GNU Project. Many Linux distributions use the word \u0022Linux\u0022 in their name, but the Free Software Foundation uses the name \u0022GNU/Linux\u0022 to emphasize the importance of GNU software, causing some controversy. Linux has grown to become a major force in computing - powering everything from the New York Stock Exchange to mobile phones, supercomputers, and consumer devices.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPopular Linux distributions include Debian, Fedora, and Ubuntu. Commercial distributions include Red Hat Enterprise Linux and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server. Desktop Linux distributions include a windowing system such as X11 or Wayland and a desktop environment such as GNOME or KDE Plasma. Distributions intended for servers may omit graphics altogether or include a solution stack such as LAMP.
