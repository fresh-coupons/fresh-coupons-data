You will Learn from the best Business and Make Profit !","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EThere\u2019s a HUGE difference between simply operating a used car dealership business and operating a profitable used car dealership. To get a better idea of the possible demand for used cars in your area, you\u2019ll need to crunch some numbers. By knowing the number of used cars sold in your area every year and month , you can estimate what percentage of the market you will be likely to be able to corner and reach. By locating the average profit per vehicle, you can get an approximate idea of how much profit and money your dealership able to make per year. While the groundwork associated with opening a dealership can be time-consuming, expensive, and demanding, the real test of your dealership\u2019s viability doesn\u2019t begin until after you open your doors to the public. Without the right management of your dealership, all the effort you put into laying the foundation will be wasted. While each state has its own rules and regulations, there are several important universal aspects of operating a car dealership and tips on how you can get the most out of your investment. Your customers are the single most important factor in the success or failure of your business, so taking the time to identify who they are and what they care about is absolutely vital. Take a look at the types of cars you plan on selling, then do some research to determine the age, gender, and income level of the average individual who owns those types of vehicles. Later down the line, this will allow you to tailor your marketing and advertising efforts toward those who are most likely to be interested in what you have to offer. Make sure to base any of your conclusions regarding your target clients on real actionable data; don\u2019t simply make assumptions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/car-flipping-earn-money-from-selling-used-cars-ocsaly/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4741312_7b69_3.jpg","duration":"1.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"22,942.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Beginner Used Car Business Leaders"],"tags":["Car Flipping"],"rating":{"count":74,"averageValue":"4.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"OCSALY Academy | 210.000\u002B Students","url":"/user/online-academy-of-computer-science/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.03125}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"19USD_JUNE2029","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"2 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/wordpress-and-hosting-for-beginners/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4685108,"title":"Create a WordPress website with Hostinger!","shortDescription":"Build your own WordPress website in a few steps.

It was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994. The PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group. PHP originally stood for \u003Cem\u003EPersonal Home Page\u003C/em\u003E, but it now stands for the recursive initialism \u003Cem\u003EPHP: Hypertext Preprocessor\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPHP code is usually processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module, a daemon, or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. On a web server, the result of the interpreted and executed PHP code \u2013 which may be any type of data, such as generated HTML or binary image data \u2013 would form the whole or part of an HTTP response. Various web template systems, web content management systems, and web frameworks exist which can be employed to orchestrate or facilitate the generation of that response. Additionally, PHP can be used for many programming tasks outside of the web context, such as standalone graphical applications and robotic drone control. Arbitrary PHP code can also be interpreted and executed via a command-line interface (CLI).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe standard PHP interpreter, powered by the Zend Engine, is free software released under the PHP License. PHP has been widely ported and can be deployed on most web servers on almost every operating system and platform, free of charge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe PHP language evolved without a written formal specification or standard until 2014, with the original implementation acting as the \u003Cem\u003Ede facto\u003C/em\u003E standard which other implementations aimed to follow. Since 2014, work has gone on to create a formal PHP specification.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs of January 2021, 72% of PHP websites use discontinued versions of PHP, i.e. PHP 7.2 or lower, which are no longer supported by The PHP Development Team. A large additional fraction uses PHP 7.3, which is only (up to December 6, 2021) \u0022supported for critical security issues only.\u0022 Over 40% of all PHP websites use version 5.6 or older, which not even Debian supports (Debian 9 supported version 7.0 and 7.1).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBeginner Friendliness\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEasy to Get Started With\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPHP was designed to make web development easier, and many beginners find it effortless to pick up and get started with. In fact, PHP code was so easy to pick up, many non-programmers end up being able to hack PHP code together without truly understanding the code. While good programmers will never copy and paste code they don\u0027t understand, this speaks volumes about how easy it is to pick up PHP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe latest version of PHP (PHP8) has fixed a lot of inconsistencies and fatal errors as well.
