Internal, external, executive briefings, 1:1, and more. The methods you learn in this course are applicable to any situation where you want people to gather together and produce a specific outcome. Client meetings are no different. By the end of the client meeting something will be different from when the meeting started. The clients may be better informed, decisions have been made, or a deal struck. Now, this solution won\u2019t stop clients being upset or magically solve problems with the work.

By giving you a simple, repeatable model to follow every time you need to have a meeting. Few meetings are ever the same. Every meeting has a different topic, purpose, audience, and expected output. The key to having great meetings is to make sure you know what those things are before you get into the room or onto the zoom call.
