There is a lot to get into when we are talking about building a project of this size, of course. So if you learned PHP, MySQL a little bit of PDO, and Bootstrap and want to train your skills you are in the right place. You are going to be exposed to a lot of different parts of web development areas and techniques and so on. This should be a rich experience for you if you are stuck with tutorials and do not know when to start when building projects. Also, there are going to be a lot of bugs along the way and we are going to solve them together, so be prepared for some real coding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E Let\u0027s take a quick deep dive into what we are going to be building. The first thing naturally is the config part of the app and then the fully validated customizable authentication system, and then we are going to create a full profile system, and while we are at it we are going to learn how to update it. after that, we are going to get into a very serious part and that is the job posting that\u0027s when we are going to do a lot of validation because only the companies are going to create the jobs, show, delete, and update them. And then we are going to take a look at another important part and that is applying for jobs and that\u0027s only going to be for job seekers and we will implement the categories system and we will take care of various forms of general parts inside the website like displaying certain data, validations and search input and so on. And of course, there is a lot more to add to this.
