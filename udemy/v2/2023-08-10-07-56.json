This is basically an extensive project based course where you will be guided step by step on how to build a cryptocurrency price tracking website using Wordpress alongside with Cryptocurrency Widgets plugin which is a Wordpress plugin that was specifically designed to create cryptocurrency market price tracker just like Coinmarketcap and Coingecko. In addition, Cryptocurrency Widgets plugin is also supported by CoinGecko API, therefore, the price data that will be displayed on the Wordpress website will be reliable and most up to date data. In the introduction session, you will learn the basic fundamentals of Wordpress and get to know more about Cryptocurrency Widgets which is the plugin that will be utilised in this project. Then, you will also get to know the general overview of the project that we are going to build as well as all features that will be included. Before getting to the main section of the course, you will be guided step by step on how to set up all necessary tools like creating an account on Taste WP which is Wordpress testing platform that we are going to use and also installing the plugin that we need for this project. Once we are ready, you will learn step by step on how to build the crypto price tracker website from scratch, we will go over how to import the price columns and how to change the currency. After the website has been built, we are going to be conducting testing to make sure that the crypto price tracking website has been fully functioning and also easy to use from the user\u2019s perspective. There will be four main testing objectives that will be emphasised in this course, those are functionality testing, user experience testing, compatibility testing, and performance testing. Once the website has been tested and passed all the required criteria, you are going to get to know more about affordable domain and hosting options. Hopefully, this particular section will enable you to make informed decisions about which hosting service you want to use. At the end of the course, you will also learn how to monetise your cryptocurrency price tracking website, we will go over several strategies such as displaying ads, premium ICO, and subscription based model.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, before getting into the course, we need to ask ourselves this question: why should we learn or even build a cryptocurrency price tracking website? Well, there are many answers to that question but in my opinion, cryptocurrency, web 3.0, and blockchain have been growing very rapidly in the past few years, hence, the demand for crypto tracking websites will always be there. If you were thinking about creating the exact clone of Coinmarketcap or Coingecko, then most likely, it will not work since they have already dominated the market a long time even before you started however if you have new creative ideas and try to combine those innovations with crypto price tracker system in your website, I am pretty sure you have a good chance to succeed. Besides crypto, learning how to build and design websites using Wordpress is also a high demand skill to have in today\u2019s market as more and more companies are transforming toward massive scale digitalisation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow are things that you can expect to learn from the course:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearning the basic fundamentals of Wordpress \u0026amp; Cryptocurrency Widgets plugin\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearning how to build Wordpress website using TasteWP\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearning how to create a fully animated cryptocurrency price ticker on Wordpress\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearning how to add cryptocurrency price list with detailed information, such as market cap, supply, transaction volume, etc\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearning how to add multi-currency tabs on Wordpress\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConducting testing on the website with four main testing objectives, those are functionality testing, user experience testing, performance testing, and compatibility testing\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGetting to know more about affordable domain \u0026amp; hosting provider options\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearning how to integrate ads to Wordpress website\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearning how to monetise cryptocurrency price tracking website\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/building-cryptocurrency-price-tracker-website-with-wordpress/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5484248_8459.jpg","duration":"2 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"1,242.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["People who are interested in building cryptocurrency price tracking website","People who are interested in building \u0026 designing Wordpress website"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":0,"averageValue":"0.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"Christ Raharja","url":"/user/christ-raharja/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":0}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"945FC8A4F7FA50B7F8F7","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"3 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/facebook-ads-launch-pro-advertising-campaigns/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4793900,"title":"Facebook Ads 2023: Launch Your Best Advertising Campaign","shortDescription":"Move from simple to compelling advertising campaigns with Facebook Ads and increase your value in the business","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELooking for a promotion in the marketing field or switching to a new job?

Electronics differs from classical electrical engineering in that it uses active devices to control electron flow via amplification and rectification, whereas classical electrical engineering only uses passive effects such as resistance, capacitance, and inductance to control electric current flow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EElectronics covers an extremely broad range of technology. Initially, the term referred to the study of electron behaviour and movement, particularly as observed in the first electron tubes. With advances in knowledge about the fundamental nature of electrons and how the motion of these particles could be utilised, it came to be used in a broader sense. Many scientific and technical disciplines now deal with various aspects of electronics. The development of key devices such as transistors, integrated circuits, lasers, and optical fibres has resulted from research in these fields. As a result, a wide range of electronic consumer, industrial, and military products can now be manufactured. Indeed, the world is in a state of flux.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EElectronic systems design is concerned with the multidisciplinary design of complex electronic devices and systems such as cell phones and computers. The topic ranges from the design and development of an electronic system (new product development) to ensuring its proper function, service life, and disposal. Electronic systems design is thus the process of defining and developing complex electronic devices to meet the user\u0027s specified requirements.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaboratory experimentation is an important part of the development of electronic devices due to the complexity of electronics theory. These experiments are used to test or validate the engineer\u0027s design and to identify errors. Historically, electronics labs were made up of physical electronics devices and equipment, but in recent years, the trend has shifted to electronics lab simulation software such as CircuitLogix, Multisim, and PSpice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIn this MOQ\u003C/strong\u003E,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou will be able to take the basic questions of electronics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo that you can test your knowledge in basic electronics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EGreat!
