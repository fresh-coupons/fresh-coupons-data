Soerin guided me through the different research phases, from the literature review until the conclusion and recommendations. By asking probing questions instead of immediately giving the answers to my questions, Soerin not only contributed to a thesis that I\u2019m proud of, but also made me a better researcher. The recommendations that Soerin gave during his review of my thesis drafts were helpful and often formed the basis of new insights. When I hit a block while working on a factor analysis, Soerin helped me via a Skype session during which he looked at my SPSS and SmartPLS output live. Because of his enthusiasm, positive attitude and \u201Ccan do\u201D mentality, my interactions with Soerin were always pleasant and motivating.\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ESoerin, many thanks for your support!\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKevin \u003Cbr\u003EMaster of Science in Accountancy\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u0022I would definitely recommend Soerin as thesis advisor. Not only does Soerin help with the students plan for research, he also helps to\u0026nbsp;improve the plan by making recommendations for advanced research (and additional analyses). Soerin is a very\u0026nbsp;fine coach and works very structured, which triggers the students to be passioned. Soerin is easily accessible and responsive to questions and / or ambiguities. Soerin is\u0026nbsp;certainly willing to help the students when problems occur. Soerin has a lot of knowledge, not only in the content but also in the structure and design of the study. He may also communicate this knowledge in a proper way, so that things are understandable for others. Soerin reviewed the thesis very detailed, by making comments in Word. The review notes will be clear and transparent. Soerin is very keen on the support of your written pieces with appropriate citations. He also helps to make your writing style \u0027journal proof\u0027. He gives examples (references to pieces from other papers) and make suggestions to improve your writing style. Soerin motivates others to \u201Cget the best out of yourself\u201D. Upon reviewing my thesis also noticed me that Soerin always reviewed with the why question. With this, he triggers another to think even more about the background of the texts are written. I\u2019am very positive about the contact times I had with Soerin, he shares his information with great passion, he is patient and takes his time to help you with questions or ambiguities. I don\u2019t have any improvement points for Soerin as thesis advisor.

While this thesis was outside his field, he provided me valuable feedback on the most crucial parts of my thesis, which were the main relevance between the\u0026nbsp;research question and subquestions, applied thesis methodology and theoretical structure in order to achieve consistency between title, problem, purpose and research questions. I\u2019ve also asked him to review my Final Conclusion \u0026amp; Recommendations. While his profession is in accountancy, his tips and key notes were very helpful and motivated me to finetune my thesis in some certain aspects such as re-production of my research findings and used theoretical literature. I think it is a real added value to let your thesis review by a professional teacher, who reviews dozens of master thesis a week. At the end I would really recommend anyone to let it reviewed by Soerin, which will motivate you to take the extra mile to finish your thesis on time\u003C/em\u003E\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJessica\u003Cbr\u003EMaster in Law\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#4\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022\u003Cem\u003EI hereby would like to recommend Soerin\u0026nbsp;as thesis supervisor / mentor in writing.\n\n Not for your ego but as a huge benefit for future students.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThe reason why I would recommend him is because I believe he sees\u0026nbsp;himself failing when a student fails.

Multiple programs to analyse but also multiple ways to analyse. To connect the dots for a student in times they need it the most is a comfortable action. For example: In my experience I was stuck in an analysis and he\u0026nbsp;did not tell me the answer, but showed me a door which made me think of how to deal with a hurdle.\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EImprovement can be accomplished on the areas of stopping a student when a student is only focussed on deadlines and less on quality of previous handed in parts of the thesis.

Below are some reasons why you should learn Deep learning in R\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\t1. It\u2019s a popular language for Machine Learning at top tech firms. Almost all of them hire data scientists who use R. Facebook, for example, uses R to do behavioral analysis with user post data. Google uses R to assess ad effectiveness and make economic forecasts. And by the way, it\u2019s not just tech firms: R is in use at analysis and consulting firms, banks and other financial institutions, academic institutions and research labs, and pretty much everywhere else data needs analyzing and visualizing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\t2. Learning the data science basics is arguably easier in R. R has a big advantage: it was designed specifically with data manipulation and analysis in mind. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\t3. Amazing packages that make your life easier. Because R was designed with statistical analysis in mind, it has a fantastic ecosystem of packages and other resources that are great for data science. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\t4. Robust, growing community of data scientists and statisticians. As the field of data science has exploded, R has exploded with it, becoming one of the fastest-growing languages in the world (as measured by StackOverflow). That means it\u2019s easy to find answers to questions and community guidance as you work your way through projects in R.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\t5. Put another tool in your toolkit. No one language is going to be the right tool for every job. Adding R to your repertoire will make some projects easier \u2013 and of course, it\u2019ll also make you a more flexible and marketable employee when you\u2019re looking for jobs in data science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat is the difference between Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPut simply, machine learning and data mining use the same algorithms and techniques as data mining, except the kinds of predictions vary. While data mining discovers previously unknown patterns and knowledge, machine learning reproduces known patterns and knowledge\u2014and further automatically applies that information to data, decision-making, and actions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDeep learning, on the other hand, uses advanced computing power and special types of neural networks and applies them to large amounts of data to learn, understand, and identify complicated patterns.

According to Stackoverflow JavaScript is the most popular programming language used by professional developers today. Even back-end developers choose JavaScript more often than not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E 2) It\u2019s in your browser\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJavaScript is, without question, the default language of the internet. You need to look no further than your browser for proof since JavaScript was most likely used to develop it. Since browsers are a necessary part of any user\u2019s online experience, it\u2019s easy to see why JavaScript is so significant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E3) JavaScript also exists outside of the internet\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJavaScript has many uses that go beyond its traditional internet roles. It powers smart televisions, works with the internet of things (IoT), creates native apps for iOS and Android, and builds cross-platform desktop apps, to name a few.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E4) JavaScript is Ideal for Newbies\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince it\u2019s already installed on every web browser today, JavaScript spares the rookies from the chore of setting up a development environment. Newcomers can just jump in and start coding. It\u2019s one of the most accessible entries into coding available, a value-add for beginners. There is also a large online community that offers support and advice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, JavaScript is an excellent tool for beginning programmers who want to expand their skill set into other languages. JavaScript supports valuable skills such as object-oriented, functional, and imperative styles of programming. Beginner developers, in turn, can apply these skills to any new language they want to learn, like Python, Java, or C\u002B\u002B.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E5) JavaScript is Easy to Learn\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot only is it a natural language to use, but JavaScript is also easy to pick up.

Do you want to do user-side (front-end) coding? You can do it in conjunction with Angular. Are you more interested in the server-side (back-end)? Bring Node.js into the mix and you can do that, too!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also create desktop, mobile, and web apps with Electron, React Native, and React.

I am Sam Rao and welcome to my C4-D fundamentals course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis course takes you through, step by step into the fine art of becoming a proficient 3D animator. The software of choice is Cinema 4D, a software becoming increasingly popular in the Broadcast and Motion Graphics industry. Each and every topic is generously interspersed with explanatory graphics which complement the material being taught. Care has been taken that keyboard shortcuts are highlighted where they have been used, and also there is a brief recap of the start of each new session of what was covered earlier. The course consists of primarily video lectures, as this was deemed the format most easily absorbed by new learners. The course does not need advanced knowledge of computers or knowledge of 2D animation or even animation principles. Each new lecture may contain some portions of the earlier lecture, so it is advised that the lectures or sessions be followed in sequence. And some topics have projects also include, but the introductory series does not. The first few chapters deal with topics that are relevant to modeling while the following series covers materials, lighting, render settings and Animation.\u0026nbsp; I hope you enjoy this relevant and practical course and do the projects that are given at the end of some chapters of this exciting and industry relevant course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will be doing all the other parts of Cinema 4D, namely lighting, Materials, Textures, Rendering and animation in later modules.
