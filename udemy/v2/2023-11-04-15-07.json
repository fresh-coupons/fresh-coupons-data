Do children today use their imaginations as much as we did when we were kids? Do you see your children spinning incredible tales and stories in their fantasy play as we used to when we played \u201Ccops and robbers\u201D or \u201Chouse\u201D? Or does your child\u2019s fantasy play seem to consist only of repetitive movements which have no story to them? I am sure you are aware of such a situation\u2026 Nowadays children are no longer as creative as they once were.\u0026nbsp; We live in an era obsessed with numbers, data, and test scores, especially as they apply to our kids and their education.\u0026nbsp; Seeing the decline in creativity should make us concerned about our children\u2019s capacities to innovate, problem-solve, and navigate new and unfamiliar situations. \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the world of child development, you may hear the phrases like \u201Ccritical thinking skills\u201D and \u201Ccreative problem-solving abilities\u201D when referring to goals for your child\u2019s cognitive development. What we are really talking about is\u2026 imagination. The way to create human beings with imagination is to provide them with opportunities to develop it for themselves when they are very young. These opportunities are found in one place and one place only\u2026 that is, play. Played with paints, playing with play dough, costumes, glue, and crayons. Making a mess. Exploring the woods. Splashing in a puddle. Wondering at a caterpillar you notice inching by you. Pretending to be a bird, gliding through the sky. All of these involve a great deal of imagination and development of their creative skills to many folds.\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, as parents, we must first learn the process of creative learning which we can offer to our kids.

The unique feature of Random forest is supervised learning. What it means is that data is segregated into multiple units based on conditions and formed as multiple decision trees.

In addition to a theoretical deep dive, the course demonstrates how to install, configure, and secure LAMP stack on Ubuntu for hosting dynamic, database driven web apps. We offer a detailed segment on server security, where students will configure both software and network firewalls for their instance using strict firewall policies, UFW and custom SSH ports. At this stage students will also learn to scale their servers both vertically and horizontally using application load balancers. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe second half of the course provides a comprehensive guide to Amazon Web Services. We start with demonstrating how to setup, secure, and navigate an AWS account. This includes setting up billing alerts and multi-factor authentication. From there, we take a deep dive into AWS Identity and Access management for enhanced account security, and the management of user accounts for various AWS services. Here we explore IAM User management and permissions, IAM Groups, IAM Policies, and access key rotation. Following the IAM section, we\u2019ll jump into the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) service. In this module students lean to deploy virtual instances on AWS using Amazon Machine Images, Elastic IPs, and Launch Templates. We will also explore IAM roles for EC2, EC2 Security Groups, SSH key pair authentication, and remote administration using both terminal and EC2 Instance connect.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAs you can see this course covers a tremendous bit of ground and we hope you\u2019re just as excited about this course as we are, if so - hit that enroll button and let\u2019s get started.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-and-linode-the-ultimate-guide-to-cloud-computing-iaas/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4874958_fd10.jpg","duration":"13 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"31,377.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Students interested in Cloud Computing","Students interested in Deploying and Configuring Remote Instances","Students interested in the Foundations of Linux","Students interested in the Foundations of Web Server Software (Apache \u0026 NGINX)","Students interested in Server Security (Network \u0026 Hosted Firewalls, UFW)","Students interested in learning the Foundations of AWS (IAM, EC2)"],"tags":["Amazon AWS","Cloud Computing","LAMP Stack","Cloud Architecture"],"rating":{"count":159,"averageValue":"4.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"YouAccel Training","url":"/user/youaccel/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.2}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"YOUACCEL92684","originalPrice":"\u20B92,499","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"3 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/html-css-certification-course-for-beginners/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":2410956,"title":"HTML \u0026 CSS - Certification Course for Beginners","shortDescription":"Lean the Foundations of HTML \u0026 CSS to Create Fully Customized, Mobile Responsive Web Pages","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the \u003Cstrong\u003EHTML \u0026amp; CSS \u2013 Certification Course for Beginners\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/strong\u003EThis two part series provides an in-depth look at the fundamentals of coding in HTML and CSS.

React, also known as React JS, is a powerful JavaScript library used for building custom, interactive user interfaces using UI components. Some of the most well known examples of organizations using React for their front-end include Netflix, Facebook, and Airbnb. Developed and maintained by Meta along with a community of independent developers, React remains free and open-source. React is a component based library built entirely on JavaScript, which makes it perfect for designing complex UI\u2019s. With React, developers can build encapsulated components that efficiently manage their own state and render UI updates specifically when data changes. For example, think of the automated content refresh feature you see on a twitter feed, or facebook like button. Here the state of the UI component changes on the page, without having to manually refresh when the data is updated. This is just one small, yet powerful feature of React.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThrough a complete hands-on project, this course will teach you all the fundamental principles of React that you must know to become a proficient React developer. We start right from the basics, including the tools needed to get started. From there we dive into JSX, functional components, props, callbacks, and various OnClick events. By this stage, the calculator will have a complete visual display, coupled with functional arithmetic operations. Students then move on to passing parameters in Callback functions, using the React State Hook, and debugging.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn addition to the hands-on React module, we also offer a comprehensive overview of JavaScript for those who need a refresher. Here we start with introducing students to the document object model (DOM) which defines the logical structure of HTML documents. From there we dive into JavaScript to demonstrate various methods in which DOM elements can be manipulated to add interactivity to static components. We start right from the basics, which includes JavaScript placement, and data output. From there we move on to variable declaration, arithmetic operations, operator precedence, data types, and objects. Once the foundations are covered, we move on to more complex operations using Arrays, Conditional Statements, JavaScript comparison operators, booleans and loops.

With this course you have the opportunity to relive this fond childhood memory by building a connect-4 clone using React. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EReact, also known as React JS, is a powerful JavaScript library used for building custom, interactive user interfaces using UI components. Some of the most well known examples of organizations using React for their front-end include Netflix, Facebook, and Airbnb. Developed and maintained by Meta along with a community of independent developers, React remains free and open-source. React is a component based library built entirely on JavaScript, which makes it perfect for designing complex UI\u2019s. With React, developers can build encapsulated components that efficiently manage their own state and render UI updates specifically when data changes. For example, think of the automated content refresh feature you see on a twitter feed, or Facebook like button. Here the state of the UI component changes on the page, without having to manually refresh when the data is updated. This is just one small, yet powerful feature of React.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThrough a complete hands-on project, this course will teach you all the fundamental principles of React that you must know to become a proficient React developer. We start with the tools needed to get started with React, along with instructions on creating the Connect-4 game board. From there we dive in to React OnClick Events, Passing Props, Destructing, React Children, and Passing Arguments. With a solid understanding of the foundations, students move on to various styling techniques for the game components, along with Dynamic classes, and handling callbacks. Here we\u2019ll explore inline, global, and dynamic styling coupled with dynamic classes. We will then move on to the React State Hook, React Key Property and initializing the game modules. Students then tackle more intermediate concepts including the logical components of calculating a winner, determining a draw, and React Lifecycle events. In the last module, we explore the implementation of AI for automated move suggestions, and single player games.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn addition to the hands-on React module, we also offer a comprehensive overview of JavaScript for those who need a refresher. Here we start with introducing students to the document object model (DOM) which defines the logical structure of HTML documents. From there we dive into JavaScript to demonstrate various methods in which DOM elements can be manipulated to add interactivity to static components. We start right from the basics, which includes JavaScript placement, and data output. From there we move on to variable declaration, arithmetic operations, operator precedence, data types, and objects. Once the foundations are covered, we move on to more complex operations using Arrays, Conditional Statements, JavaScript comparison operators, Booleans and loops. Here students will learn to unleash the true power of JavaScript to render different outcomes based on user interaction. We will explore the use of functions to efficiently handle repetitive tasks and JavaScript events to handle output based on actions and occurrences. The section will conclude with a hands-on project where students will implement their knowledge to build a web based photo gallery and background color changer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/build-a-connect-4-clone-in-react-javascript-foundations/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4789918_7294.jpg","duration":"5.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"33,267.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Students interested in learning how to build interactive web pages using JavaScript","Students interested in learning ReactJS","Students interested in front-end UI Development using React","Students interested in learning JavaScript Foundations"],"tags":["JavaScript","React JS"],"rating":{"count":115,"averageValue":"4.3"},"instructors":[{"name":"YouAccel Training","url":"/user/youaccel/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.3421054}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"YOUACCEL92684","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"3 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-identity-and-access-management-iam-foundations/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4366436,"title":"AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) Foundations","shortDescription":"Setup and Configure Multiple Users in an AWS account using IAM.

If a table shows distribution of students in two sections according to the marks obtained by them, then how to use that data to form two frequency polygons on the same graph.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. When the large amount of data is to be presented, we can condense the data in to groups and these groupings are called \u201Cclasses\u201D or \u201Cclass-intervals\u201D and their size is called the class-size or class width. In each of these groupings/classes, the least number is called the lower class limit and the greater number is called the upper class limit. In the case of histogram, the data has to be in the form of continuous class intervals. In the case of frequency polygon, it is not necessary for the data to be in continuous class intervals.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/introduction-to-histogram-and-frequency-polygon/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5464636_e904.jpg","duration":"1 total hour","enrolledStudentsCount":"2,692.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Students and any individual who enjoys learning about various mathematical\u00A0concepts"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":6,"averageValue":"4.5"},"instructors":[{"name":"Prabh Kirpa Classes","url":"/user/prabh-kirpa-classes/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.5833335}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"3E008398191E0E60AA75","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/from-zero-to-hero-computer-virus-detection-and-eradication/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5426078,"title":"Cyber Defender\u0027s Journey: Virus  Detection and Elimination","shortDescription":"Becoming a Hero in the Battle  Against Malware","longDescription":"\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat is the meaning of a computer virus?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy is computer virus named after the biological virus?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhether antivirus software can uncover all computer viruses?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlmost all viruses are attached to an executable file.

We then explore more advanced account security through AWS identity and access management (IAM). IAM is an integral part of AWS that facilitates the management of users, groups, and security policies that control AWS resources. Here, we explore the creation of IAM users with varying degrees of account access. This includes user groups, permission policies, and IAM roles for EC2.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOnce students have a firm understanding of IAM, we dive into the backbone of AWS by exploring EC2 instance deployment and configuration. EC2 is a core service of AWS that facilitates the launch of virtual servers (called instances) within the AWS cloud console. We cover how to launch and configure EC2 instances, including choosing the right instance type and setting up security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic. We also explore remote instance administration using PuTTY and Terminal to issue server commands and manage instances from any remote location. Students learn to deploy and assign elastic IP addresses along with the creation of Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) to save instance state and quickly launch new instances with replicated configurations.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAfter completion of the EC2 module, we jump into AWS storage solutions where we explore various storage types including, block, file and object storage. More specifically students learn to harness the power of the Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) and the Amazon Elastic File System (EFS). We demonstrate how to deploy and configure multiple EBS volumes and attach them to existing instances for maximum scalability. Students also learn to design and deploy seamlessly scalable storage systems using EFS. We demonstrate how to mount multiple instances to a single EFS endpoint for centralized access to data files. We complete the module by showcasing the power of EBS snapshots and Amazon Machine Images for efficient instance deployment and backups.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EFrom this point, the course branches into more intermediate concepts by exploring elastic load balancing (ELB), Auto Scaling Groups (ASG), and Route 53. Student will learn to deploy a highly available architecture that auto scales based on real-time traffic workload and instance health checks. Traffic will be routed directly through Amazons Route 53 DNS service, with customized domain names and pre-configured hosted zones.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EBy the end of this course, you will have a solid understanding of how to use AWS to build and deploy your own cloud-based infrastructure. You will be able to launch and configure EC2 instances, store and manage data in the cloud, and use services like ELB and ASG to scale your infrastructure to meet the needs of your applications.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIf you\u0027re excited about expanding your knowledge in AWS and the field of cloud computing, hit the enroll button and let\u0027s get started.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-beginner-to-intermediate-ec2-iam-elb-asg-route-53/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5029488_f4fc_5.jpg","duration":"9.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"20,096.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Students interested in Cloud Computing with AWS","Students interested in learning the foundations of Amazon Web Services","Students interested in administering AWS accounts using Identity and Access Management (IAM)","Students interested in securing AWS accounts by assigning Access Privileges to IAM Users","Students interested in deploying Virtual Servers on AWS","Cloud Computing Enthusiasts looking to gain knowledge on using AWS","Students interested in learning about the Amazon EC2 Service","Students interested in learning various AWS Storage Solutions for EC2 (EBS, EFS)","Students interested in learning Dynamic Scaling, Elastic Load Balancing, and Auto Scaling Groups","Students interested in Managing Domain hosted zones using Amazon Route 53"],"tags":["Cloud Computing","Amazon EC2"],"rating":{"count":94,"averageValue":"4.6"},"instructors":[{"name":"YouAccel Training","url":"/user/youaccel/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.5875}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"YOUACCEL17268","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"\u20B9529","expirationText":"5 hours","discountPercentage":34}}},"freeCourses":{}}
