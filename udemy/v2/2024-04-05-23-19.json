Did you build a couple of projects with PHP and MySQL, but you still think you are inexperienced and you are missing out on a lot of things when coming to developing bigger projects? If yes, then this course is the right resource for you. This course is very digestible and informative and it was created specifically to enhance your coding skills and knowledge not just in PHP and MySQL, but overall in developing web projects. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is what we are going to do in this course. Naturally, we are going to get started by setting up the right tools for our projects. And after that, we are going to build our first simple yet very interesting project and that\u0027s a URL shortening service. The second project will be about sending emails in PHP and that\u0027s very important because it\u0027s a feature that almost every website has. The next project will be the starting of something big because it\u0027s an authentication system where I am going to teach you how to develop a login and a register page, how to hash and de-hash passwords, how to do validation and so much more. After this, we are going to build a comments system and this will be the biggest project in this course. We will begin first by doing a post system and then we will grab comments for every post that we have of course we will use Ajax-JQuery for inserting, deleting, and showing comments. after that, we will integrate a rating system into the previous two projects to make a bigger project. So, I will show how to download a JQuery plugin, how to integrate it and how to use it to do the rating system for every post, and so on. And the rating system is going to be implemented of course using Ajax-JQuery. The upcoming project is going to be also created with Ajax and JQuery and that\u0027s a live search system and we will combine it with our big project. The last project will be about building a weather app. All we are going to do is set up a form, allow the user to enter a city, and then give him the current degree of this city. So we will use an API to grab the current degree for this city.

I found this course created by TJ Walker a perfect introduction to the world of media training. I wanted to learn, not only what a media trainer does, but also what steps I would have to take in order to become a successful media trainer--TJ discusses all this in a clear and concise manner, in a tone that is welcoming and never alienating. The only constructive critique I would give would be concerning the technical form of the presentation, more specifically the video quality and picture aesthetic. Going by the current standard as it applies to video, everything we view is in high definition. Having said that, I believe the video quality could be improved upon as well as the backdrop which I found to be a bit generic and outdated. I found these minor flaws to be slightly distracting and given the high caliber of the speaker and the information being presented I believe these aspects detracted, if only marginally, from the quality of the product.\u0022\u0026nbsp;\u003C/em\u003ENick Cisik\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u00225 Stars!

This includes identifying open ports and services, as well as any vulnerabilities that can be exploited. Open ports are potential entry points for attackers, so it is important to understand which ones are exposed and what type of traffic they allow. This information can be gathered using tools.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOnce you know information about the target, you can start to attack it. In this course you will learn how to launch passwords attacks and how to setup a backdoor. A password attack is a type of brute force attack that attempts to guess passwords. Common methods include dictionary attacks, where a list of common words is used as the basis for guessing, and brute force attacks, where every possible combination of characters is tried. Password attacks can be very effective, especially if the passwords are weak or easily guessed.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ESetting up a backdoor on a system allows an attacker to gain access even if the system is properly secured. This can be done by placing a malicious program on the system that gives the attacker remote access, or by modifying an existing program to give the attacker access. Backdoors can be difficult to detect, so it is important to be aware of them when assessing security threats.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/ethical-hacking-network-exploitation-basics/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4672476_b5f7.jpg","duration":"1 total hour","enrolledStudentsCount":"28,027.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Beginner Ethical Hackers"],"tags":["Ethical Hacking"],"rating":{"count":251,"averageValue":"3.8"},"instructors":[{"name":"Peter A","url":"/user/peter-1943/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":3.8076923}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"FANTASTIC","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"\u20B9449","expirationText":"5 hours","discountPercentage":44}}},"freeCourses":{}}
