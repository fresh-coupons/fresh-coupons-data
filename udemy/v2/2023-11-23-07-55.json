According to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, small and midsize companies suffer more losses due to fraud than their larger counterparts. Experts estimate that companies lose 5% to 6% of their annual revenue to fraud, so every company should have a comprehensive fraud prevention program. A fraud prevention program is not difficult to implement. It simply consists of education, investigation, and proactive prevention policies. Since employees are the most likely to report issues or any fraudulent activities, you certainly want to give them both the knowledge and the tools to help your company weed out any instances that may be taking place. And while fraud prevention efforts are designed to stop employee fraud, note that any investigations of suspected instances of fraud or employee theft may also act as a deterrent to other employees who may be either committing or contemplating fraud. The bulk of your company\u0027s fraud prevention efforts should be focused on the creation and implementation of proactive preventive techniques. This includes establishing internal controls and putting into place policies and procedures that are specifically designed to prevent fraud. One of the best ways to develop prevention policies may include utilizing an experienced anti-fraud professional. Make sure to find one who is experienced and has investigated numerous instances in order to help you to develop the most relevant and most effective anti-fraud controls.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/corporate-fraud-regulations-control/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5621770_4bfa.jpg","duration":"2 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"1,472.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Bankers, Accountants, Stakeholders of a company, Anyone who wants to learn about fraud control"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":2,"averageValue":"4.3"},"instructors":[{"name":"EDUCBA Bridging the Gap","url":"/user/premananda-suna/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.5}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"EDUCBABF19","originalPrice":"\u20B91,999","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/customer-analytics-training-for-beginners/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4725694,"title":"Customer Analytics Training for Beginners","shortDescription":"Understand how data is used to find out customer behavior and to create more effective business strategies.","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003ECustomer analytics is the technology that helps organizations unlock details about their customers and find insights that can expand their businesses and increase their return on investment in such endeavors.

Two fundamental principles of Islamic banking are the sharing of profit and loss and the prohibition of the collection and payment of interest by lenders and investors. In Islamic banking, the banks do not collect interests from creditors. Instead, they earn money using equity participation systems and share profits and losses. Islamic finance is practiced in many Muslim countries and is extremely popular among Islamic communities, as some conventional banking practices might be against Shariah. Islamic finance is considered more ethical than conventional banking, as it believes that a bank and its clients should make profits and losses together. Hence, it does not just focus on maximizing the bank\u2019s wealth. Also, Islamic finance practices consider the best interests of the Muslim community.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIslamic banking development can be attributed to some conventional banking theories and practices which go against and hurt the sentiments of the Muslim communities. Hence, Islamic finance was developed by inventing methods that are Sharia-compliant. Sharia is the Islamic law present in the Quran\u2019s teachings. Creating practices that align with the Muslim culture and beliefs encourages many to take up banking. Islamic finance is so strictly followed that banks look to religious leaders and scholars for guidance.

Traditional ways to succeed no longer work and you have to look beyond them to achieve greater success. Leading is an important trait that can be used in development of an organization. To initiate decisions that are translated in to concrete actions can be done only by true leaders who can fore see all kinds of situations. Managers must guide and motivate their people to achieve newer heights and become an asset to the company. A leader must direct, influence and motivate employees to perform essential tasks. At times of emergency, every manager must act as a leader to overcome business crisis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA good leader guides, instructs and motivates his fellow assistants and helps them work better. The skills, effectiveness and capacity of a great leader depend on how he manages his subordinates in times of crisis. He should work together along with other co workers to benefit the organization he is working in.Great leaders have the capacity to influence the subordinates in a positive way and get the work done in lesser time with the collective efforts of each employee. Leadership qualities are necessary in each individual, especially in people who are in managerial positions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EManagerial leadership can be seen in different dimensions in the modern day organizations.
