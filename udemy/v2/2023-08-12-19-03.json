Employees used to get annual performance reviews as part of the performance management process. In recent years, research has shown that frequent feedback is more effective than annual reviews, so many companies have dropped the annual review model for regular manager check-ins and informal feedback sessions.

This is a project based course where you will learn step by step on how to build a news channel and to create news videos with fully animated and super realistic AI powered news anchors. This course will give you a whole new perspective about how artificial intelligence is more than capable of revolutionising journalism. In addition, you will also be amazed by how far AI can automate news videos creation by speeding up the editing process as well as replacing human news anchors with a hyper realistic artificial intelligence powered news anchor as the substitution which can be very useful for independent journalist who want to keep their identity secret due to privacy or safety reasons. In the introduction session, you will learn several aspects where AI can be utilised to create news videos, such as converting news scripts to audio and producing animated news anchors to present the news. Then, you will continue by getting to know several news sources like Google News, AP News, and Reuters as well as learning how to check the potential bias and reliability of the news. This part is very crucial to make sure the news you are planning to cover are actually factual. Afterward, you will get to know several news topic ideas that you should consider and it is really recommended for you just to pick one and concentrate on that one topic. Once you have chosen your news topic, we will enter the main part of the course where you will be guided step by step on how to create and edit news video from scratch using AI tools like HeyGen, HourOne, and Paradiso AI. Those tools will enable you to convert text to audio as well as to integrate the audio with the fully animated news anchors. Once the video has been created and ready to be uploaded, we will go over comprehensive analysis on which social media platform that you should be uploading to. In that section, we will be mainly focusing on Youtube and Tiktok since those two platforms have the most audience and also the best options for video based contents. Last but not least, at the end of the course, you will learn several different ways to monetise your news channel and how to potentially turn this side hustle into a sustainable media business.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, before getting into the course, we need to ask this question to ourselves: why should we build a news channel? Well, if you were asking this question five or ten years ago, at that time, there had not been a lot of independent journalist yet and most of journalists work for media companies, nonetheless, the situation is totally different nowadays, as the rise of independent journalism in the past few years, more and more news channels are created on social media platforms like Youtube and Tiktok. Therefore, anybody can be an independent journalist nowadays and it is very possible to combine it with content creation. The advancement of artificial intelligence technologies in the past couple years also contributed very significantly where today you can even create news channels and upload videos where you are reporting news without showing your face since you can replace it with AI powered news anchors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow are things that you can expect to learn from the course:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to automate news videos creation process using AI\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to analyse and check if the news is unbiased, neutral, accurate, and factual\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to convert news articles from Google News, AP News, and Reuters into news scripts using ChatGPT\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to customise AI powered news anchors avatars\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to create a hyper realistic news videos with AI powered news anchor using HeyGen\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to create a hyper realistic news videos with AI powered news anchor using HourOne\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to create a hyper realistic news videos with AI powered news anchor using Paradiso AI\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to create breaking news intro using Canva\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to add subtitles automatically and edit news videos using Veed IO\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFull comprehensive analysis on which social media platform is the best to host your content videos: comparing Yotube vs Tiktok\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn several different strategies to monetise news videos and how to potentially turn this side hustle into a news channel business\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/automating-journalism-make-news-channel-with-ai-news-anchor/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5489852_b307.jpg","duration":"2.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"399.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Journalists who are interested to use AI to automate their news content creation process","People who are interested in starting a news channel or news agency"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":0,"averageValue":"0.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"Christ Raharja","url":"/user/christ-raharja/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":0}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"599C1794466BC765765E","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-practice-exam-new/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4567644,"title":"AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Practice Exams 2023","shortDescription":"Full 6 Practice Exams with explanation | Pass the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner CLF-C01 Exam","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe fastest and easiest way to pass the AWS Cloud Practitioner exam\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to this comprehensive practice test for the \u003Cstrong\u003EAWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Exam\u003C/strong\u003E.

It is a complex and multidisciplinary field that draws on elements of geography, history, political science, economics, and sociology.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGeopoliticians study the physical features of the Earth, such as its landforms, climate, and natural resources, as well as the human factors that shape these features, such as population density, economic development, and political institutions. They then use this knowledge to analyze the distribution of power and influence in the world, and to predict how changes in the global landscape might affect the future of international relations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHistorical knowledge is important for geopolitics because it helps us to understand how past events have shaped the current political landscape. For example, the Cold War had a profound impact on the geopolitical order of the world, and its legacy continues to shape the way that countries interact today. By understanding the history of geopolitics, we can better understand the forces that are driving current events, and we can make more informed predictions about the future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are some examples of how historical knowledge is important for geopolitics:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe location of important natural resources, such as oil and gas, can have a significant impact on the geopolitical balance of power. For example, the control of the Strait of Hormuz, which is a major shipping route for oil, is a major geopolitical issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe distribution of population can also be a factor in geopolitics. For example, countries with large populations, such as China and India, are often seen as having a greater potential for power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe history of political institutions can also be important for geopolitics.

This is basically an extensive project based course where you will be guided step by step on how to build a cryptocurrency price tracking website using Wordpress alongside with Cryptocurrency Widgets plugin which is a Wordpress plugin that was specifically designed to create cryptocurrency market price tracker just like Coinmarketcap and Coingecko. In addition, Cryptocurrency Widgets plugin is also supported by CoinGecko API, therefore, the price data that will be displayed on the Wordpress website will be reliable and most up to date data. In the introduction session, you will learn the basic fundamentals of Wordpress and get to know more about Cryptocurrency Widgets which is the plugin that will be utilised in this project. Then, you will also get to know the general overview of the project that we are going to build as well as all features that will be included. Before getting to the main section of the course, you will be guided step by step on how to set up all necessary tools like creating an account on Taste WP which is Wordpress testing platform that we are going to use and also installing the plugin that we need for this project. Once we are ready, you will learn step by step on how to build the crypto price tracker website from scratch, we will go over how to import the price columns and how to change the currency. After the website has been built, we are going to be conducting testing to make sure that the crypto price tracking website has been fully functioning and also easy to use from the user\u2019s perspective. There will be four main testing objectives that will be emphasised in this course, those are functionality testing, user experience testing, compatibility testing, and performance testing. Once the website has been tested and passed all the required criteria, you are going to get to know more about affordable domain and hosting options. Hopefully, this particular section will enable you to make informed decisions about which hosting service you want to use.

Well, there are many answers to that question but in my opinion, cryptocurrency, web 3.0, and blockchain have been growing very rapidly in the past few years, hence, the demand for crypto tracking websites will always be there. If you were thinking about creating the exact clone of Coinmarketcap or Coingecko, then most likely, it will not work since they have already dominated the market a long time even before you started however if you have new creative ideas and try to combine those innovations with crypto price tracker system in your website, I am pretty sure you have a good chance to succeed.
