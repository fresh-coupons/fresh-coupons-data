To run a business at optimal capacity, you need to reduce or eliminate waste from processes and improve production flow. In this course, you\u0027ll learn about Lean strategies to reduce waste by determining which operations add value and which don\u0027t. You\u0027ll explore the concept of continuous flow, and discover how to balance work processes to make production flow more efficient.

And in any business, one of the heaviest drains on profitability is waste. Lean waste can come in the form of time, material, and labor. But it may also be related to the utilization of skill-sets as well as poor planning. In lean manufacturing, waste is any expense or effort that is expended but which does not transform raw materials into an item the customer is willing to pay for. By optimizing process steps and eliminating waste, the only true value is added at each phase of production.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday, the Lean Manufacturing model recognizes 8 types of waste within an operation; seven originally conceived when the Toyota Production System was first conceived, and an eighth added when the lean methodology was adopted within the Western World.

However, MySQL and PHP are often swapped for alternative software solutions such as MariaDB, and Python. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe course starts with a detailed overview on setting up and configuring an instance remotely using terminal and terminal emulators such as PuTTY. Here, students learn the foundations of Linux and various Linux distributions such as Ubuntu to securely power web servers. Students will learn various Linux maintenance and directory commands, coupled with user account configuration and disabling root user access. From there, we dive into the foundations of database management systems and explore the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases. We also explore the two main database transaction standards, including ACID and CAP theorem. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOnce students have a solid understand on the foundations of cloud computing, we demonstrate how to securely install and configure LAMP Stack on Ubuntu.

This module will help you to understand the complex theory behind the Delta Wye transformer connection as I aim to build your strong concept through phasor diagrams. After this module you will be able to draw Delta Wye connection of transformer. By the end of this part, you will have a strong idea on voltage phasor diagram for delta connected transformer.

This section will teach you how Wye connection is made on windings of transformer, what are different ways to configure Wye connection. To give you a better understanding of Wye Wye transformer connection, I discussed the difference of line and phase current in both windings of transformer.

It entails understanding political ideas, ideologies, institutions, policies, processes, and behavior, as well as groups, classes, government, diplomacy, law, strategy, and war.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAugust Comte opined that theories are the conceptual lenses through which we can sort out the plethora of facts that we confront daily. In fact, without theories, we might not be able to identify something as a fact at all. There are some features of a good theory. The first virtue is parsimony which implies frugality. A theory should be parsimonious to forgo unnecessary speculation and confusing details. The second feature of a sound theory is accuracy. Theories must be sufficiently detailed to allow for accurate assessments and explanations of the world. An elegant theory simply yet precisely interprets, describes, explains, or predicts some aspect of the world. However, these virtues are mostly identified as features of scientific theories. The explanatory and predictive behavior of natural sciences is not found in social sciences as too many uncontrolled and unforeseen forces affect political and social life and that is why social and political practices are seldom replicable. In light of these problems, some experts have argued that social scientists should not try to mimic the natural sciences; instead, they should develop their own standards and procedures. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor theorists of social and political life, therefore, the ability to feel and think in ways similar to the object of study is a crucial component of their task. In the West, political theory emerged out of political philosophy on one hand, and political thought, on the other. But it should be remembered that political theory is different from both. It differs from political philosophy in the sense that it is less formal and atomistic and less concerned to establish logical relationships between individual political concepts. Political theory is different from political thought by being less historical in focus. Thus, political theory is an essentially mixed mode of thought. It not only embraces deductive argument and empirical theory but combines them with normative concern, so acquiring a practical, action-guiding character. It is an attempt to arrive at a comprehensive, coherent, and general account of the sorts of things that we talk about when we discuss politics. A good political theorist is able to move between social conditions and political concepts. Political theory must involve a good deal of knowledge of political practice. Another aspect of political theory is that it is always defined by the specific situations and problems political thinkers have witnessed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo understand political theory, we need to understand both the history of ideas on which the thinkers draw and the problems they considered themselves to be facing and to which their work was addressed.

It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables.
