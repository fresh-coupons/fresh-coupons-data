The course starts right from the basics, where we explore various cloud computing service models. This includes infrastructure as a service, platform as a service, and software as a service. From there students gain hands-on experience with creating and administering remote virtual instances, complete with Ubuntu, Apache, MariaDB, and PHP. Students will learn the difference between popular web servers like Apache and NGINX, along with a detailed overview of various database management systems. This includes both SQL and NoSQL databases, in addition to database transaction standards such as ACID and CAP Theorem. In addition to a theoretical deep dive, the course demonstrates how to install, configure, and secure LAMP stack on Ubuntu for hosting dynamic, database driven web apps. We offer a detailed segment on server security, where students will configure both software and network firewalls for their instance using strict firewall policies, UFW and custom SSH ports. At this stage students will also learn to scale their servers both vertically and horizontally using application load balancers. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe second half of the course provides a comprehensive guide to Amazon Web Services.

Here we explore IAM User management and permissions, IAM Groups, IAM Policies, and access key rotation. Following the IAM section, we\u2019ll jump into the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) service. In this module students lean to deploy virtual instances on AWS using Amazon Machine Images, Elastic IPs, and Launch Templates.

Course for any who want to develop the knowledge of art therapy","The importance of knowledge of art therapy and work-life balance for managers, employers, and HR managers cannot be overstated. Both concepts play a significant role in promoting the well-being and productivity of employees, which ultimately benefits the organization as a whole. Here\u0027s how they are interconnected and how learning about art therapy can increase the quality of life:","Stress Reduction and Mental Health Support:  Managers, employers, and HR managers need to recognize that the modern workplace can be a source of stress and mental health challenges for employees. Long hours, tight deadlines, and high expectations can lead to burnout and decreased job satisfaction.  Art therapy provides a creative and expressive outlet for employees to manage stress, cope with anxiety, and process their emotions. It can be a valuable tool in promoting mental well-being and resilience.","Enhanced Creativity and Problem-Solving:  Creativity is a valuable asset in the business world. Managers and employers can benefit from the knowledge of art therapy in fostering creativity and innovation among their teams.  Engaging in creative activities through art therapy can help employees think outside the box, approach challenges with fresh perspectives, and come up with innovative solutions.","Improved Communication and Team Building:  Effective communication and team collaboration are essential for any organization\u0027s success. Art therapy can facilitate better interpersonal skills and teamwork.  Learning about art therapy can help managers and HR professionals incorporate team-building exercises that encourage collaboration, trust, and empathy, thus fostering a more harmonious work environment.","Work-Life Balance:  Managers and HR managers play a pivotal role in creating a workplace culture that values work-life balance. This includes promoting flexible work hours, encouraging vacation days, and recognizing the importance of personal time.  Knowledge of work-life balance strategies can result in higher employee retention, increased motivation, and a healthier work environment. Art therapy can be part of these strategies as a way to de-stress and recharge outside of work.","Employee Well-being and Job Satisfaction:  Employee well-being directly impacts job satisfaction and, consequently, an organization\u0027s overall success. Managers and HR managers should prioritize their employees\u0027 overall quality of life.  Art therapy can contribute to a higher quality of life by providing individuals with a sense of purpose, self-expression, and a means of exploring and addressing personal challenges. When employees are happier and healthier, they are more likely to be engaged and productive in their roles.","Incorporating knowledge of art therapy and work-life balance into managerial practices can lead to a more supportive, creative, and fulfilling work environment.
