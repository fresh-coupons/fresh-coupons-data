React, also known as React JS, is a powerful JavaScript library used for building custom, interactive user interfaces using UI components. Some of the most well known examples of organizations using React for their front-end include Netflix, Facebook, and Airbnb. Developed and maintained by Meta along with a community of independent developers, React remains free and open-source. React is a component based library built entirely on JavaScript, which makes it perfect for designing complex UI\u2019s. With React, developers can build encapsulated components that efficiently manage their own state and render UI updates specifically when data changes. For example, think of the automated content refresh feature you see on a twitter feed, or facebook like button. Here the state of the UI component changes on the page, without having to manually refresh when the data is updated. This is just one small, yet powerful feature of React.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThrough a complete hands-on project, this course will teach you all the fundamental principles of React that you must know to become a proficient React developer. We start right from the basics, including the tools needed to get started. From there we dive into JSX, functional components, props, callbacks, and various OnClick events. By this stage, the calculator will have a complete visual display, coupled with functional arithmetic operations. Students then move on to passing parameters in Callback functions, using the React State Hook, and debugging.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn addition to the hands-on React module, we also offer a comprehensive overview of JavaScript for those who need a refresher. Here we start with introducing students to the document object model (DOM) which defines the logical structure of HTML documents. From there we dive into JavaScript to demonstrate various methods in which DOM elements can be manipulated to add interactivity to static components. We start right from the basics, which includes JavaScript placement, and data output. From there we move on to variable declaration, arithmetic operations, operator precedence, data types, and objects. Once the foundations are covered, we move on to more complex operations using Arrays, Conditional Statements, JavaScript comparison operators, booleans and loops. Here students will learn to unleash the true power of JavaScript to render different outcomes based on user interaction. We will explore the use of functions to efficiently handle repetitive tasks and JavaScript events to handle output based on actions and occurrences. The section will conclude with a hands-on project where students will implement their knowledge to build a web based photo gallery and background color changer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/build-a-custom-e-commerce-site-in-react-javascript-basics/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4789922_401f.jpg","duration":"7 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"27,682.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Students interested in learning the Foundations of JavaScript","Students interested in learning the Foundations of ReactJS Library","Students interested in Building Interactive UI Components using React","Students interested in learning how to build a fully customized E-Commerce Site in React"],"tags":["JavaScript","React JS"],"rating":{"count":99,"averageValue":"4.2"},"instructors":[{"name":"YouAccel Training","url":"/user/youaccel/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.2234044}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"YOUACCEL52279","originalPrice":"\u20B91,999","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"2 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-bootstrap-react-bootcamp-with-hands-on-projects/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4789952,"title":"Complete Bootstrap \u0026 React Bootcamp with Hands-On Projects","shortDescription":"Learn to Build Responsive, Interactive Web Apps using Bootstrap and React.","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the Complete Bootstrap and React Bootcamp. This course teaches students how to create modern, interactive web pages using the Bootstrap framework and React JavaScript library. The course starts with an introduction into Bootstrap with a focus on its reputation in the development community as the number one choice for mobile-first front-end web frameworks. Bootstrap is a well documented collection of reusable code written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We start with exploring the foundations of Bootstrap, including embedding it into projects, and building out the basic Bootstrap page structure. From there we catapult into the infamous Bootstrap grid system, along with the commonly used three column web page layout. After the introductory topics, students learn to work with a number of components from typography, tables and image styling right up to wells, alerts, and buttons. As part of the course we demonstrate how to build out intricate navigation menus using dropdown, collapse, accordion, and pill menus. We will also cover form styling, carousels, modals, scrollspy and just about every other Bootstrap component that\u2019s instrumental to your journey as a front-end developer. The module concludes with a hands-on project, where students will use a Bootstrap theme to build a stunning web page from scratch.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn the second section of the course, we explore React. React, also known as React JS, is a powerful JavaScript library used for building custom, interactive user interfaces using UI components. Similar to Bootstrap, React is a well documented free and open source library. The project was founded by Meta and a network of independent developers. In this section, students learn how to use the React library through a series of hands-on projects. The React section of this course starts off with a hands-on project where you\u2019ll learn how to work with functional React components, props, Callback functions, OnClick Events, and the React State hook to build a fully functional calculator. From there we will dive into project number two, where you will build a connect-4 clone. Here we will cover more intermediate concepts including passing props, destructuring, passing arguments to click events, various styling methods, and handling callbacks. You will also learn about the React key property, React lifecycle events, and conditional rendering. By the end you will have built a complete multi and single player connect-4 game board with built-in AI capabilities. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn the final section of the course we further unleash the power of React by building out a complete e-commerce site with multiple product categories, a product showcase, shopping cart feature, and much more. Here, we introduce a number of integral new concepts including: JSON server, Fetch API, and installing React router. These essential building blocks will be used to render the product categories, style the product list, and configure the product details page. From there we dive into styled components, refactoring the shop layout, and exploring the concept of \u201Ccontext\u201D in React. In the final stages of the project students will configure the shopping cart basket, and the checkout feature. We will also implement a product search feature, followed by in-depth exercises on validating input forms in React.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAs you can see this course covers a tremendous bit of ground. Best of all it features Tim Maclachlan - a renowned senior full-stack developer with over 20 years of commercial development experience. As a multi-faceted developer, Tim specializes in algorithmic, analytical and mobile development.

Sustainable Development Goal 16: Promote Just, Peaceful, and Inclusive Societies, calls for all Member States to promote peaceful co-existence among people. Some of its primary targets include reducing arms flows and combatting organized crime, as well as significantly reducing all forms of violence worldwide.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday more than 600 million young people live in volatile and conflict-prone areas. Young people are disproportionately affected by the multiple and often interlinked forms of violence such as political violence, organized crime and terrorist attacks which exact human, social and economic costs. In the past decade, the recruitment of young people into violent and extremist groups has led some to view youth as a threat to global security and stability. However, research shows that the number of young people who actively participate in violence is a small minority, while the vast majority of youth are not prone to violence, despite the injustices, deprivations and abuse they can confront daily, particularly in conflict zones. Moreover, a growing body of evidence suggests that they can and do play active roles as agents of positive and constructive change, and the recently adopted Security Council Resolution 2250 on Youth, Peace and Security highlights this fact. It is a formal recognition of the positive role youth can play in the maintenance of international peace and security.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe maintenance of global peace and security is a cross cutting issue that is critical to achieving all the Sustainable Development Goals. Several UN offices are involved in the promotion and maintenance of international peace and security including: the Security Council, General Assembly, Secretary-General, Departments of Peacekeeping Operations, Field Support and Political Affairs and the Peacebuilding Support Office. Universities and institutions of higher learning are also important actors because they educate future leaders and peacemakers, who will shape the course of peace building in the world.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/peace-and-conflict-resolution/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4040440_6fd1.jpg","duration":"3.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"6,559.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Teachers","B.A","M.A","Working Professionals","Researchers","Laywers"],"tags":["Conflict Management"],"rating":{"count":21,"averageValue":"4.2"},"instructors":[{"name":"Dr. Swati Chakraborty","url":"/user/swati-chakraborty-5/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.1363635}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"PEACE_623","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"2 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/install-nginx-php-mysql-ssl-wordpress-on-ubuntu/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":1844490,"title":"Install NGINX, PHP, MySQL, SSL \u0026 WordPress on Ubuntu","shortDescription":"Learn to Install \u0026 Configure NGINX on Ubuntu 18.04.

The development by Kary Mullis in 1986of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Especific segments of DNA spawned another revolution.Recombinant DNA technology, PCR, and other molecular\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etechnologies are leading to an ever-increasing number ofexciting discoveries that are furthering our knowledge of\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebasic biological functions and will lead to improvementsin the quality of human life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E In recent years, the sequencing of the genomes ofa large number of viruses and organisms has changed thescope of experiments performed by geneticists.

\u0026nbsp;he best way to start a poultry enterprise is to begin modestly and let the business build its increases\u0026nbsp; It is believed that poultry production started in Asia over 3000 years ago. Although some records suggest that chickens were raised around 3200 BC, archaeological evidence only goes back to about 2000 BC. It is considered that chickens originate from India, and that the red jungle fowl is an ancestor to today\u2019s modern chicken. The breeding of chickens in captivity dates back to at least 1400 BC in Egypt. But intensive poultry production only\u0026nbsp; before 7500 BCE. Chickens were brought to Sumer In Thebes, Egypt, the tomb of Haremhab, built about 1420 BCE, shows a depiction of a man carrying bowls of ostrich eggs and other large eggs,\u0026nbsp; arrived in Greece around 800 BCE, where the quail had been the primary source of eggs IN ancient Rome, eggs were preserved using a number of methods, and meals often started with an egg course The dried egg industry developed in the 19th century, before the rise of the frozen egg industry. In 1878, a company in St. Louis, Missouri started to transform egg yolk and white into a light-brown, meal-like substance by using a drying process.\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;intensive poultry production only began in the 20th century. Indeed, the past 100 years have seen an impressive growth, chiefly in the production of chickens and eggs, turkeys, ducks, and geese. It is the advent of vaccination for conditions such as Marek\u2019s disease, in addition to preproducing good quality day-old chicks starts with the breeder flock. Not only is the quality of the egg important, but also the health and nutritional status of the breeders are having an impact on day-old markable improvements in nutrition, genetics, and management, that has allowed the poultry industry to quickly develop since the late 1960s\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; In general we can divide the factors associated with chick quality in two categories: EGG RELATED FACTORS hatchery and brooding management factors (egg handling , incubation, chick processing and placement SOURCES OF CHICKENS Primary breeding companies supply the breed performance These white hybrid layers are capable of laying 324 eggs per hen housed at 72 weeks of age with a feed conversion of 3.04 pounds of feed per dozen or 1.91 kg feed per kg of egg.der stock chickens for various breeder/hatchery companies who then supply the day-old pullet chicks to be grown into laying hens housing system feeding program in general\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;lighting program\u0026nbsp; economy of layer farm indices layer health management vaccination program suggested vaccination program spray vaccine onovo vaccine hatchary vaccine fowl pox vaccine cleaning disinfection receiving baby chicks\u0026nbsp; automation in layer farm egg collection manure removal flock following rearing table postmortem\u0026nbsp; procedures serology how to take blood sample how to make Elisa test\u0026nbsp; Elisa software\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/master-layer-farm-management-the-business-of-millionaires/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4355500_374e.jpg","duration":"5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"15,635.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["any one interested in poultry business","begginer in business world"],"tags":["Management Skills"],"rating":{"count":52,"averageValue":"4.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"Mohamed AL ashram","url":"/user/mohamed-taha-288/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.4}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"9A79EA1D742896FE308E","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-css-megacourse-beginner-to-expert/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5399948,"title":"Complete CSS Megacourse: Beginner to Expert","shortDescription":"Learn how to master CSS and create stunning web designs with this project-based course!","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELearn CSS Fundamentals for Beautiful Web Designs!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDesign like a pro!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave you ever wanted to create stunning websites and web applications that look beautiful and function flawlessly?
