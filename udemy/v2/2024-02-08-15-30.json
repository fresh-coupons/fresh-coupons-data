Organizational Culture: HR plays a significant role in shaping the company\u0027s culture. A positive culture can improve employee satisfaction, motivation, and overall performance.  Strategic Planning: HR professionals contribute to the company\u0027s strategic planning by aligning HR practices with the organization\u0027s goals, ensuring that human capital is leveraged effectively.","For Individuals Building a Career:  Career Opportunities: Understanding HRM principles can open up career opportunities in HR departments of various companies, consulting firms, or as an independent HR consultant.  Soft Skills Development: HRM involves honing soft skills such as communication, conflict resolution, and interpersonal skills, which are valuable in any career.","Career Advancement: HR knowledge can help individuals advance in their careers, especially if they aim for leadership or managerial roles where people management skills are critical.  Problem-Solving: HR professionals often deal with complex issues, requiring problem-solving skills. Learning HRM equips individuals with these skills that are transferable to other roles.","Understanding Workplace Dynamics: Understanding HRM helps individuals navigate workplace dynamics, making it easier to build relationships, resolve conflicts, and thrive in their current positions.

This is a comprehensive project based course where you will learn step by step on how to create captivating 3D models using advanced AI technologies. This course will give you a whole new perspective about the future of 3D modeling and game design. You will be fascinated by how far artificial intelligence has advanced in the past couple of years to the point where you can write a simple text prompt to produce high quality 3D models and even more exciting you can also animate those 3D models using AI. In the introduction session, you will learn about AI applications in 3D animations and understand how it can help 3D animators to automate the process of creating and animating 3D models. Then, we are going to start the project section. Firstly, you will learn to create 3D models from text using several AI tools like Tripo AI, Avaturn, Luma AI, Sloyd AI, and MasterPiece X. The process will be very simple, all you need to do is to write the prompt describing how the 3D model should look like, then in less than a minute AI will generate the 3D model. In the next section, you will learn to convert 2D images to hyper realistic 3D models using AI tools like Meshy AI, Alpha 3D, Leia Pix. Afterward, in the third project section, you will learn to animate 3D models using several AI tools like Anything World, Krikey AI, and Charmed AI. After that, you will also learn to create 3D game assets using several AI tools like Layer AI, Scenario, and Game Generator. Meanwhile, in the fifth section, you will perform motion capture using Deep Motion. Then, you will also learn to build virtual reality using Skybox AI. In the last section, you will build a 3D avatar chatbot that has the capability of talking to your web visitor. Then, you will also integrate the 3D avatar chatbot to your website. Can you imagine, you are able to add a super realistic 3D digital human avatar to answer questions from your customers on your website. Well, this is definitely much better compared to regular chatbots that communicate through text messaging systems. At the end of the course, we are going to talk about several important aspects that we need to pay close attention to when creating 3D animations using AI, such as realistic physics and dynamics, cross platform integration, file format compatibility, and context alignment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirstly, before getting into the course, we need to ask this question to ourselves: why should we utilize generative AI for creating 3D animations? Well there are many reasons why and let me answer it from the perspective of 3D animators and game designers, firstly, finding new ideas and design inspirations can be very time consuming. In addition to that, the process of transforming those ideas into 3D models can be quite challenging. Generative AI can help you to automate and speed up the process without reducing the quality of the 3D models. Can you imagine how long it will take you to do 3D modeling, sculpting, rigging, and adding animation to the 3D models? Well, that process is going to take a while. Therefore, outsourcing some part of the work to AI will certainly be a good idea and it will help you to be more productive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow are things that you can expect to learn from this course:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn about AI applications in 3D animations and game assets creation\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to create 3D models using Luma AI, Tripo AI, Sloyd AI, and MasterPiece X\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to transform yourself into 3D avatar using Ready Player Me and Avaturn\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to convert 2D image to 3D model using Meshy AI and Alpha 3D\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to convert 2D image to 3D animation using Leia Pix\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to animate 3D models using MasterPiece X, Charmed AI, and Anything World\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to create 3D animation video using Krikey AI\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to create game assets with Layer AI, Scenario, and Game Generator\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to perform motion capture using Deep Motion\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to build virtual reality using Skybox AI\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to build 3D avatar chatbot using Chattier and integrate the chatbot to website\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/creating-3d-animations-game-asset-avatar-chatbot-with-ai/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5799350_ad51.jpg","duration":"2 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"986.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["People who are interested in creating 3D models, 3D animations, and game assets using AI","People who are interested in building interactive 3D avatar chatbot"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":0,"averageValue":"0.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"Christ Raharja","url":"/user/christ-raharja/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":0}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"F6AE34C73DDBA53A5CFC","originalPrice":"\u20B91,999","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/linux-desktop-automation/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":2267006,"title":"Linux Desktop Automation","shortDescription":"Use Bash Scripting to Automate the Desktop","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to automate your Linux desktop with Bash scripting. \u00A0This includes moving the mouse, windows, clicking around or even login to systems remotely (over ssh) and take over the desktop all from a bash script.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you want to move your bash scripting to the next level and automate the Linux desktop?\u00A0enroll today!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/linux-desktop-automation/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2267006_1a16_3.jpg","duration":"44 total mins","enrolledStudentsCount":"24,078.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Linux users that want to automate their Desktop with Bash scripts","Intermediate Linux users"],"tags":["Bash Shell"],"rating":{"count":104,"averageValue":"4.3"},"instructors":[{"name":"Peter A","url":"/user/peter-1943/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.5}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"YOURTIME","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/ultimate-character-design-course/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5562054,"title":"Ultimate Character Design Course with Adobe Illustrator","shortDescription":"Master Character Design in Adobe Illustrator: From Sketch to Digital Art.","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EUnlock your creative potential and master character design with Adobe Illustrator in record time!

As people interact with your business, integration methods like the Conversions API and Facebook pixel share those events with Facebook. Events help power your Facebook ads so you can reach a more relevant audience, provide a more personalized ad experience and optimize your ad campaigns towards better business outcomes. Events take place either as a result of Facebook ads (paid) or organic reach (unpaid).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELearn How to Use, Setup \u0026amp; Optimise Meta Aggregated Events\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFacebook\u2019s Aggregated Event Measurement is a protocol that allows for measurement of web events from iOS 14 users. Aggregated Event Measurement limits domains to 8 conversion events that can be prioritized for conversion optimization. So, please, learn with me Facebook Ads \u0026amp; Instagram Ads for 2022. If you optimize your ads for non-prioritized events, your ads won\u2019t deliver to and report on people who are opted-out of tracking on their Facebook or Instagram apps on an iOS 14.5 or later device. Facebook solution is analogous to Apple\u2019s Private Click Measurement, but it is designed to solve for key advertiser use cases not addressed by Apple\u2019s proposal. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELearn Reach Ads for your Local Business\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reach objective maximizes the number of people who see your ads and how often they see them. Choose this objective if you want to build brand awareness, change brand perception or show your ad to as many people in your audience as possible. With this objective, you can choose to maximize your reach or impressions for the entire duration of your campaign.
