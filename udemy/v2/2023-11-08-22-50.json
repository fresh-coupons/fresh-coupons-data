For example, if there is a rise in temperature it will also lead to a rise in the sales of ice creams. This is called positive correlation. Correlation analysis deals with relationship among variables. The correlation coefficient lets researchers to measure if there is a possible linear relationship between two variables measured on the same subject. The values of the correlation coefficient are always between -1 and \u002B1. There are different types of correlation coefficients used for different situation. The most common is the Pearson correlation coefficient. This chapter contains more details about the correlation theory and explains its types in detail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInterpretation of SAS Output\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe output produced by PROC CORR in SAS gives a lot of useful information. The output contains information regarding the list of variables included in the analysis. Next it provides a list of simple statistics for each variable in the analysis. This list contains the number of observations, mean, standard deviation, sum, minimum and maximum. One list contains each variable and their label. Finally the correlation measures are provided in the output. The output will be named \u201CPearson Correlation Coefficient\u201D by default.

Forensic accounting is the investigation of fraud or financial manipulation by performing extremely detailed research and analysis of financial information. Forensic accountants are often hired to prepare for litigation related to insurance claims, insolvency, divorces, embezzlement, fraud, skimming, and any type of financial theft. Forensic accountants or auditors take a unique focus on performing their work. Typically, when a person with forensic experience is called in to examine financial records, it is due to suspicion of fraud, evaluation of assets, or even to track down fundamentally incorrect accounting.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/forensic-accounting-fraud-detection-and-investigation/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5615328_42e9.jpg","duration":"3 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"1,127.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Students, Professionals, Accountants, Tax professionals, Anyone who wants to understand forensic accounting"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":2,"averageValue":"5.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"EDUCBA Bridging the Gap","url":"/user/premananda-suna/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":5}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"EDUCBABF22","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/derivatives-forward-contracts/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5619116,"title":"Derivatives - Forward Contracts","shortDescription":"Learn about the Derivative market and understanding the forward contracts and its relationship with interest rates","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EThe course discusses about the Derivative market and understanding the forward contracts and its relationship with interest rates.

A forward contract can be used for hedging or speculation, although its non-standardized nature makes it particularly apt for hedging. A forward contract, often shortened to just forward, is a contract agreement to buy or sell an asset at a specific price on a specified date in the future. Since the forward contract refers to the underlying asset that will be delivered on the specified date, it is considered a type of derivative. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA forward contract is an agreement between two parties to trade a specific quantity of an asset for a pre-specified price at a specific date in the future.

It identifies who has power and accountability, and who makes decisions. It is, in essence, a toolkit that enables management and the board to deal more effectively with the challenges of running a company. Corporate governance ensures that businesses have appropriate decision-making processes and controls in place so that the interests of all stakeholders (shareholders, employees, suppliers, customers and the community) are balanced. Good corporate governance can benefit investors and other stakeholders, while bad governance can lead to scandal and ruin. Governance refers to the set of rules, controls, policies, and resolutions put in place to direct corporate behavior. A board of directors is pivotal in governance, while proxy advisors and shareholders are important stakeholders who can affect governance. Communicating a company\u0027s corporate governance is a key component of community and investor relations. For instance, Apple Inc.\u0027s investor relations site profiles its corporate leadership (the executive team and board of directors) and provides information on its committee charters and governance documents, such as bylaws, stock ownership guidelines, and articles of incorporation. Most successful companies strive to have exemplary corporate governance. For many shareholders, it is not enough for a company to be profitable; it also must demonstrate good corporate citizenship through environmental awareness, ethical behavior, and other sound corporate governance practices.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/corporate-governance-us-and-uk-markets/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5621750_ba49.jpg","duration":"2.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"1,096.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Bankers, Accountants, Stakeholders of a company, Anyone who wants to learn about corporate governance"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":0,"averageValue":"0.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"EDUCBA Bridging the Gap","url":"/user/premananda-suna/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":0}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"EDUCBABF22","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/private-equity-course-for-beginners-peq101/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5592954,"title":"Private Equity Course for Beginners (PEQ101)","shortDescription":"The course will deep dive you through the concepts of private equity training and its various components.","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EThe training is very appropriate from the viewpoint of fund managers as it will give them an idea as to what all points to consider, bid-ask spread, exit routes in the investment process, term sheets, and their importance and process to bridge the gap in bid-ask.

According to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, small and midsize companies suffer more losses due to fraud than their larger counterparts. Experts estimate that companies lose 5% to 6% of their annual revenue to fraud, so every company should have a comprehensive fraud prevention program. A fraud prevention program is not difficult to implement. It simply consists of education, investigation, and proactive prevention policies. Since employees are the most likely to report issues or any fraudulent activities, you certainly want to give them both the knowledge and the tools to help your company weed out any instances that may be taking place. And while fraud prevention efforts are designed to stop employee fraud, note that any investigations of suspected instances of fraud or employee theft may also act as a deterrent to other employees who may be either committing or contemplating fraud. The bulk of your company\u0027s fraud prevention efforts should be focused on the creation and implementation of proactive preventive techniques. This includes establishing internal controls and putting into place policies and procedures that are specifically designed to prevent fraud. One of the best ways to develop prevention policies may include utilizing an experienced anti-fraud professional.

CART is a predictive algorithm used in Machine learning and it explains how the target variable\u2019s values can be predicted based on other matters. It is a decision tree where each fork is split into a predictor variable and each node has a prediction for the target variable at the end. Classically, this algorithm is referred to as decision trees, but on some platforms like R they are referred to by the more modern term CART. The CART algorithm provides a foundation for important algorithms like bagged decision trees, random forest and boosted decision trees.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs the name suggests, CART (Classification and Regression Trees) can be used for both classification and regression problems. The difference lies in the target variable. That is, With classification, we attempt to predict a class label. In other words, classification is used for problems where the output (target variable) takes a finite set of values, e.g., whether it will rain tomorrow or not. Meanwhile, regression is used to predict a numerical label. This means your output can take an infinite set of values, e.g., a house price.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDecision Trees are an important type of algorithm for predictive modeling machine learning. The classical decision tree algorithms have been around for decades and modern variations like random forest are among the most powerful techniques available. In this post you will discover the humble decision tree algorithm known by it\u2019s more modern name CART which stands for Classification And Regression Trees. The web is full of apps that are driven by data. All the e-commerce apps and websites are based on data in the complete sense. There is database behind a web front end and middleware that talks to a number of other databases and data services. But the mere use of data is not what comprises of data science. A data application gets its value from data and in the process creates value for itself. This means that data science enables the creation of products that are based on data. This course includes learning decision tree modeling which are used by data scientists or people who inspire to be the data scientist.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Decision Tree Algorithm is one of the popular supervised type machine learning algorithms that is used for classifications. This algorithm generates the outcome as the optimized result based upon the tree structure with the conditions or rules. The decision tree algorithm associated with three major components as Decision Nodes, Design Links, and Decision Leaves. It operates with the Splitting, pruning, and tree selection process. It supports both numerical and categorical data to construct the decision tree. Decision tree algorithms are efficient for large data set with less time complexity.

Statistical knowledge is required to understand the logical interpretations of the Decision tree. As we have seen the decision tree is easy to understand and the results are efficient when it has fewer class labels and the other downside part of them is when there are more class labels calculations become complexed.

The decision tree can be represented by graphical representation as a tree with leaves and branches structure. The leaves are generally the data points and branches are the condition to make decisions for the class of data set. Decision trees in R are considered as supervised Machine learning models as possible outcomes of the decision points are well defined for the data set. It is also known as the CART model or Classification and Regression Trees.

A decision tree is non- linear assumption model that uses a tree structure to classify the relationships. The Decision tree in R uses two types of variables: categorical variable (Yes or No) and continuous variables. The terminologies of the Decision Tree consisting of the root node (forms a class label), decision nodes(sub-nodes), terminal node (do not split further). The unique concept behind this machine learning approach is they classify the given data into classes that form yes or no flow (if-else approach) and represents the results in a tree structure. The algorithm used in the Decision Tree in R is the Gini Index, information gain, Entropy. There are different packages available to build a decision tree in R: rpart (recursive), party, random Forest, CART (classification and regression). It is quite easy to implement a Decision Tree in R.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor clear analysis, the tree is divided into groups: a training set and a test set.

An IPO allows a company to raise equity capital from public investors. The transition from a private to a public company can be an important time for private investors to fully realize gains from their investment as it typically includes a share premium for current private investors. Meanwhile, it also allows public investors to participate in the offering.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first step in the IPO process is for the issuing company to choose an investment bank to advise the company on its IPO and to provide underwriting services. Underwriting is the process through which an investment bank (the underwriter) acts as a broker between the issuing company and the investing public to help the issuing company sell its initial set of shares. After the IPO is approved by the SEC, the effective date is decided. On the day before the effective date, the issuing company and the underwriter decide the offer price (i.e., the price at which the shares will be sold by the issuing company) and the precise number of shares to be sold. Deciding the offer price is important because it is the price at which the issuing company raises capital for itself. After the issue has been brought to the market, the underwriter has to provide analyst recommendations, after-market stabilization, and create a market for the stock issued. The final stage of the IPO process, the transition to market competition, starts 25 days after the initial public offering, once the \u201Cquiet period\u201D mandated by the SEC ends.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/fund-raising-through-ipos-and-fpos/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5621716_e72a.jpg","duration":"3 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"1,104.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Students and Professionals"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":4,"averageValue":"4.9"},"instructors":[{"name":"EDUCBA Bridging the Gap","url":"/user/premananda-suna/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.875}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"EDUCBABF22","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/credit-research-analysis-and-credit-ratings-for-beginners/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5613818,"title":"Credit Research Analysis and Credit Ratings for Beginners","shortDescription":"Credit Research | Credit Ratings | Credit Models | Credit worthiness of a company | and many more","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EUnderstand Credit analysis process for various sectors like real estate, manufacturing, Construction etc. also learn the Credit report writing techniques.

This course teaches students how to create modern, interactive web pages using the Bootstrap framework and React JavaScript library. The course starts with an introduction into Bootstrap with a focus on its reputation in the development community as the number one choice for mobile-first front-end web frameworks. Bootstrap is a well documented collection of reusable code written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We start with exploring the foundations of Bootstrap, including embedding it into projects, and building out the basic Bootstrap page structure. From there we catapult into the infamous Bootstrap grid system, along with the commonly used three column web page layout. After the introductory topics, students learn to work with a number of components from typography, tables and image styling right up to wells, alerts, and buttons. As part of the course we demonstrate how to build out intricate navigation menus using dropdown, collapse, accordion, and pill menus. We will also cover form styling, carousels, modals, scrollspy and just about every other Bootstrap component that\u2019s instrumental to your journey as a front-end developer. The module concludes with a hands-on project, where students will use a Bootstrap theme to build a stunning web page from scratch.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn the second section of the course, we explore React. React, also known as React JS, is a powerful JavaScript library used for building custom, interactive user interfaces using UI components. Similar to Bootstrap, React is a well documented free and open source library. The project was founded by Meta and a network of independent developers. In this section, students learn how to use the React library through a series of hands-on projects. The React section of this course starts off with a hands-on project where you\u2019ll learn how to work with functional React components, props, Callback functions, OnClick Events, and the React State hook to build a fully functional calculator. From there we will dive into project number two, where you will build a connect-4 clone. Here we will cover more intermediate concepts including passing props, destructuring, passing arguments to click events, various styling methods, and handling callbacks. You will also learn about the React key property, React lifecycle events, and conditional rendering. By the end you will have built a complete multi and single player connect-4 game board with built-in AI capabilities. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn the final section of the course we further unleash the power of React by building out a complete e-commerce site with multiple product categories, a product showcase, shopping cart feature, and much more. Here, we introduce a number of integral new concepts including: JSON server, Fetch API, and installing React router. These essential building blocks will be used to render the product categories, style the product list, and configure the product details page. From there we dive into styled components, refactoring the shop layout, and exploring the concept of \u201Ccontext\u201D in React. In the final stages of the project students will configure the shopping cart basket, and the checkout feature. We will also implement a product search feature, followed by in-depth exercises on validating input forms in React.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAs you can see this course covers a tremendous bit of ground. Best of all it features Tim Maclachlan - a renowned senior full-stack developer with over 20 years of commercial development experience.

Linear programming also makes the basic foundation behind complex optimization tools like Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) and Column generation. In this course, we will study the basic theoretical concepts related to linear programming. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe course is organized as follows. In the first section, we will introduce linear programming, and we will explore the convexity and types of optimalities. Then, in the second section, we will build up on the basics to learn ways to solve the linear program using the simplex method. We will then explore the concept of linear programming duality. We will also go through some of the hardest-to-understand concepts like strong duality, complementary slackness, and Farkas\u0027 lemma. Furthermore, we try to understand these concepts in an easy-to-follow way. This allows one to obtain lower bounds on the minimization problem and provide proof of optimality or Infeasibility. In the last section, we will explore how to perform sensitivity analysis (the effects of changing parts of a linear program). At the end of each section, there are assignments to help you evaluate your knowledge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you would have noticed, this course doesn\u0027t explore modeling optimization problems as a linear program much.

React, also known as React JS, is a powerful JavaScript library used for building custom, interactive user interfaces using UI components. Some of the most well known examples of organizations using React for their front-end include Netflix, Facebook, and Airbnb. Developed and maintained by Meta along with a community of independent developers, React remains free and open-source. React is a component based library built entirely on JavaScript, which makes it perfect for designing complex UI\u2019s. With React, developers can build encapsulated components that efficiently manage their own state and render UI updates specifically when data changes. For example, think of the automated content refresh feature you see on a twitter feed, or facebook like button. Here the state of the UI component changes on the page, without having to manually refresh when the data is updated. This is just one small, yet powerful feature of React.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThrough a complete hands-on project, this course will teach you all the fundamental principles of React that you must know to become a proficient React developer. We start right from the basics, including the tools needed to get started. From there we dive into JSX, functional components, props, callbacks, and various OnClick events. By this stage, the calculator will have a complete visual display, coupled with functional arithmetic operations. Students then move on to passing parameters in Callback functions, using the React State Hook, and debugging.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn addition to the hands-on React module, we also offer a comprehensive overview of JavaScript for those who need a refresher. Here we start with introducing students to the document object model (DOM) which defines the logical structure of HTML documents. From there we dive into JavaScript to demonstrate various methods in which DOM elements can be manipulated to add interactivity to static components. We start right from the basics, which includes JavaScript placement, and data output. From there we move on to variable declaration, arithmetic operations, operator precedence, data types, and objects. Once the foundations are covered, we move on to more complex operations using Arrays, Conditional Statements, JavaScript comparison operators, booleans and loops. Here students will learn to unleash the true power of JavaScript to render different outcomes based on user interaction. We will explore the use of functions to efficiently handle repetitive tasks and JavaScript events to handle output based on actions and occurrences. The section will conclude with a hands-on project where students will implement their knowledge to build a web based photo gallery and background color changer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/build-a-custom-e-commerce-site-in-react-javascript-basics/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4789922_401f.jpg","duration":"7 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"39,618.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Students interested in learning the Foundations of JavaScript","Students interested in learning the Foundations of ReactJS Library","Students interested in Building Interactive UI Components using React","Students interested in learning how to build a fully customized E-Commerce Site in React"],"tags":["JavaScript","React JS"],"rating":{"count":157,"averageValue":"4.4"},"instructors":[{"name":"YouAccel Training","url":"/user/youaccel/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.325}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"YOUACCEL54835","originalPrice":"\u20B91,999","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}}},"freeCourses":{}}
