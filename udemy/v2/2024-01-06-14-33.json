In this course and in under 9 hours, you are going to learn how to build an amazing e-commerce web app. It\u0027s a pretty decent size project. We are going to get going first by setting up the database and I already prepared the design with bootstrap for us. After this, we are going to display the products neatly and dynamically and we going to build the most challenging part of this project which is the cart. In the cart, there are going to be a lot of details like adding products updating and deleting from the cart, and showing the number of products in it and that\u0027s all going to be done without refreshing the page with Ajax-JQuery of course. And after all of this, we are simply going to process the payment with stripe and we are going to checkout and place orders finally. At the end of this whole process, we are going to give users the products that they paid for. This is the main function of this web app. Surely there is going to be an authentication system, a category system, and more on the users\u0027 side.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThere is also a cool and very practical admin panel, where we are going to handle general functions about our user\u0027s side.
