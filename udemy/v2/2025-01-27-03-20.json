That means that most project managers are likely to use spreadsheet software such as LibreOffice Calc or Microsoft Excel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the main reasons that project managers do not use project management software is the lack of support from an organisation. Learning how to use spreadsheets to create effective management tools means that you will not have this problem. There will be no need to use expensive software that nobody knows how to use!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProjects require ongoing monitoring and tracking. You will already understand this but have you got the skills to work with spreadsheets and create something effective? By the end of this course, the answer will be \u2018yes\u2019.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the essential tools you, and your project team, are going to need is the project tracker. The project tracker is a critical tool to monitor and manage various aspects of a project. You will use this tool to monitor progress, tasks, schedules, and resources. There are various software solutions out there but being able to create a tracker enables you to build something specific to your project.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA project tracker is an invaluable tool that will help you and your team stay organised. The tracker is also an effective communication tool. You can communicate to your team how progress is going and highlight any issues with tasks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou will learn how to plan the layout, add formatting, and include conditional formatting to your project tracker. This will provide you with an excellent visual presentation of your tasks, schedules, resources, and progress. Your team will easily be able to view the progress of the project and have no difficulties in understanding the information.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe course also provides additional tools that will complement the project tracker. The first tool is the plan. You will need to create a project plan before building the tracker. This will enable you to plan the tasks, deliverables, milestones, and outcomes of the project. From the plan, the project tracker can be developed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother essential tool is the project budget. You will learn how to create one. The project budget should be used to complement the project tracker. The project tracker focuses on the general management of schedules and resources. The budget focuses on cost analysis and budget control, the financial management of the project.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe course includes tutorials that will teach you how to create a project status report. You will learn what the status report is and why it is essential for communication. Think of the project status report as a snapshot of the project tracker.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnrolling on this course will allow you to progress through easy-to-follow tutorials broken down into short video lengths. You will easily be able to learn at your own pace. This course will take you through each step of creating a professional project tracking tool. You will also be provided with spreadsheet templates that you can review and play around with. However, it is recommended that you learn how to build a project tracker from scratch to improve your spreadsheet development skills.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe tutorials feature LibreOffice Calc as the spreadsheet software of choice. However, Microsoft Excel has the same functionality and you will be able to create the tools shown in the tutorials. The navigation may be a little different but you will be expected to have spreadsheet experience before enrolling on this course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe course is not going to teach you all about project management. There will be several tutorials included that will teach you about the jargon associated with project tracking such as deadlines, deliverables, milestones, and risk management. But you should already have a good understanding of project management in practice either through experience or studies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis course is all about you developing spreadsheet skills that most modern organisations will be looking for. Enrol now and add those essential IT skills to your resume.
