It assumes that you\u0027re new to the language, so it gets you started with basic functionality such as creating functions, creating variables, and calling these lines of code from your standard HTML pages. It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are practicals of:\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E* Javascript Course Contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Array\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Variables\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Functions\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Objects\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/css-and-javascript-crash-course/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4271184_7325_2.jpg","duration":"1 total hour","enrolledStudentsCount":"125,061.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["For CSS And Beginners","For People Who want to learn CSS Fundamentals and later Transition into Web Designing","For People New to CSS And Javascript"],"tags":["CSS","JavaScript"],"rating":{"count":1965,"averageValue":"4.2"},"instructors":[{"name":"PROPER DOT INSTITUTE","url":"/user/vivek-dahibhate-2/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.2642856}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"ED40C6798C79F8CA3F0B","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/unleash-your-full-potential-learn-english-now/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":6289829,"title":"Unleash Your Full Potential: Learn English Now!","shortDescription":"Your Journey to English Fluency Starts Here I Interchange Fifth Edition Unofficial","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELevel Up Your English Skills!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis English course is designed to help you improve your language skills and gain confidence in real-world communication.

This includes choosing between traditional media (TV, radio, print) and digital media (online ads, social media, email marketing).  Creative Development: Crafting the content and visuals of the advertisements. This includes writing compelling copy, designing visuals, and ensuring consistency with the brand\u0027s messaging and identity.  Budgeting: Allocating financial resources for advertising campaigns. This involves determining how much money to spend on each campaign and allocating funds to different media channels.  Execution: Implementing the advertising plan, which includes negotiating with media outlets, launching campaigns, and monitoring their progress.  Evaluation and Analysis: Assessing the effectiveness of advertising campaigns through various metrics and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). This involves analyzing consumer response, sales data, and other relevant factors to measure the campaign\u0027s success.  Adjustment and Optimization: Based on the evaluation, advertising management may involve making adjustments to future campaigns. This could include refining the target audience, adjusting messaging, or reallocating budget to more successful channels.","Effective advertising management requires a combination of creativity, market knowledge, and analytical skills. It plays a critical role in helping organizations connect with their target audience, build brand awareness, and achieve marketing objectives. The field is dynamic, with professionals adapting to changes in consumer behavior, technology, and media trends to stay ahead in the competitive landscape."],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":230,"averageValue":"4.4"},"instructors":[{"name":"MTF Institute of Management, Technology and Finance","url":"/user/mtfinstitute/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.39}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"C2D90D5C11F876CAD994","originalPrice":"\u20B91,989","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"1 day","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-etsy-now/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4964994,"title":"Learn Etsy Now: Print-on-Demand with Etsy for Beginners","shortDescription":"Learn how to easily set up and launch your own Etsy store on the Etsy Marketplace for your online business step-by-step!","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EEtsy is one of the largest global online marketplaces on the Internet where you can find an unimaginable amount of unique shops and items made for every type of customer.

A successful manager is now expected to act as a leader, a mentor, and a coach, guiding their team members towards individual and collective success. This paradigm shift highlights the significance of coaching techniques in the realm of managerial responsibilities.","The Transformation of Managerial Roles  Evolving Leadership Expectations  The traditional image of a manager as a stern authority figure has given way to a more holistic view of leadership. Managers are now expected to serve as role models, motivators, and mentors to their teams. This shift stems from the recognition that employees perform at their best when they feel valued, supported, and empowered.  The evolution of leadership expectations can be traced back to the changing dynamics of the modern workplace. In the past, managers were primarily responsible for enforcing rules and ensuring productivity. However, as organizations began to realize that employee engagement and satisfaction were crucial for success, a transformation in managerial roles ensued.  Today, managers are not just tasked with overseeing tasks and projects; they are expected to inspire and empower their teams. This shift is partly a response to the changing nature of work itself. In a knowledge-based economy, where creativity, innovation, and adaptability are paramount, traditional top-down management no longer suffices.","Coaching as a Leadership Skill  Coaching has emerged as a pivotal leadership skill that fosters personal and professional growth. We\u0027ll explore how coaching techniques, such as active listening, constructive feedback, and goal-setting, can empower managers to become effective leaders who inspire and guide their teams towards excellence.  Coaching is not a one-size-fits-all approach; it is a dynamic and personalized method of leadership. Effective coaches adapt their style to the needs and preferences of individual team members. They actively listen to understand the unique challenges and aspirations of each employee, fostering a sense of trust and rapport.  Moreover, coaching is not merely about providing solutions but guiding employees to discover answers themselves. This approach instills a sense of ownership and accountability in team members. It encourages them to take the initiative, think critically, and develop problem-solving skills\u2014a valuable asset in today\u0027s fast-paced, ever-changing business landscape.  Coaching also plays a crucial role in setting and achieving goals. Effective managers use coaching techniques to collaboratively define clear, actionable objectives with their team members. This process not only aligns individual efforts with organizational goals but also empowers employees to track their progress and make necessary adjustments along the way.","Coaching Knowledge for Career Development  Career Development in the Modern Workplace  Career development is a top priority for employees. Discover how coaching knowledge equips managers with the tools to help team members navigate their career paths, set meaningful goals, and continually improve their skills.  Career development has evolved from being a peripheral concern to a central focus in the modern workplace. In an era marked by rapid technological advancements and industry disruptions, employees recognize the importance of continuous learning and skill enhancement to remain relevant and competitive.  This heightened emphasis on career development places managers at the forefront of helping their team members chart their professional journeys. Coaching knowledge equips managers with the ability to provide guidance that is not only aligned with the organization\u0027s needs but also tailored to the aspirations of individual employees.  One of the key advantages of coaching in career development is its ability to facilitate self-awareness. Effective coaches help employees identify their strengths, weaknesses, interests, and values. Armed with this self-knowledge, employees can make informed career decisions that align with their passions and long-term goals.","The Manager as a Career Development Partner  Explore the responsibilities of middle and top managers in preparing and mentoring personal development plans for their team members. Learn how these plans can align with organizational objectives and create a win-win situation for both employees and the company.  Managers who actively engage in career development become indispensable partners in their employees\u0027 professional growth. They play a pivotal role in creating personalized development plans that leverage individual strengths and address areas needing improvement.  These development plans not only benefit the employees but also the organization. By aligning individual development goals with the company\u0027s strategic objectives, managers ensure that every team member\u0027s growth contributes to the overall success of the business.  Furthermore, coaching techniques are instrumental in fostering a growth mindset within teams.
