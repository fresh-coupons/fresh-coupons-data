This is a comprehensive project-based course where you will learn step by step on how to perform complex analysis and visualization on infectious diseases datasets. This course is a perfect combination between biostatistics and Python, equipping you with the tools and techniques to tackle real-world challenges in public health. The course will be mainly concentrating on three major aspects, the first one is data analysis where you will explore the infectious diseases data from multiple perspectives, the second one is time series forecasting where you will be guided step by step on how to forecast the spread of infectious diseases using STL model, and the third one is public health policy where you will learn how to make a data driven public health policy based on epidemiological modeling. In the introduction session, you will learn the basic fundamentals of biostatistics, such as getting to know more about challenges that we commonly face when analyzing biostatistics data and statistical models that we will use, for instance STL which stands for seasonal trend decomposition. Then, you will continue by learning how to calculate infectious disease transmission using Kermack-McKendrick equation, this is a very important concept that you need to understand before getting into the coding session. Afterward, you will also learn several factors that can potentially accelerate the spread of infectious diseases, such as population density, healthcare accessibility, and antigenic variation. Once you have learnt all necessary information about biostatistics, we will start the project. Firstly, you will be guided step by step on how to set up Google Colab IDE. Not only that, you will also learn how to find and download infectious diseases dataset from Kaggle. Once, everything is ready, we will enter the main section of the course which is the project section The project will be consisted of three main parts, the first part is to conduct exploratory data analysis, the second part is to build forecasting model to predict the spread of the diseases in the future using time series model, meanwhile the third part is to perform epidemiological modelling and use the result to develop a public health policy to slow down the spread of the infectious disease.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, before getting into the course, we need to ask this question to ourselves: why should we learn biostatistics, particularly infectious diseases analysis? Well, there are many reasons why, firstly, if you are interested in working in the public health or healthcare industry, having biostatistics knowledge would be very beneficial and help you to level up your career. In addition to that, you will also learn a lot of valuable skill sets that can be implemented in other projects, for example, time series decomposition can be used to forecast stock, real estate, commodity, and cryptocurrency markets. Last but not least, this course will also train you to be a better public health policy maker as you will extensively learn how to make data driven decisions and take other external factors into consideration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow are things that you can expect to learn from this course:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn the basic fundamentals of biostatistics and infectious disease analysis\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to calculate infectious disease transmission rate using SIR model\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn several factors that accelerate the spread of infectious disease, such as population density, herd immunity, and antigenic variation\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to find and download datasets from Kaggle\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to clean dataset by removing missing rows and duplicate values\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to detect potential outliers using Z score method\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to find correlation between population and disease rate\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to analyze infected patient demographics\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to map infectious disease per county using heatmap\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to analyze infectious disease yearly trend\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to perform confidence interval analysis\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to forecast infectious disease rate using time series decomposition model\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to do epidemiological modeling using SIR model\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to perform public health policy evaluation\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-biostatistics-analyzing-infectious-diseases-data/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5623864_3824.jpg","duration":"3 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"1,228.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["People who are interested in learning biostatistics","People who are interested in analysing infectious disease dataset"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":0,"averageValue":"0.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"Christ Raharja","url":"/user/christ-raharja/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":0}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"A417897BE7BEF79A58CC","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/curso-de-manualidades-y-bolitas-navidenas/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":2060237,"title":"Curso de Manualidades y Bolitas Navide\u00F1as","shortDescription":"Aprende a realizar manualidades y bolitas navide\u00F1as para decorar tu casa e iniciar tu propio negocio.","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u00BFTE GUSTAR\u00CDA SORPRENDER A FAMILIARES Y AMIGOS CON REGALOS ORIGINALES Y HECHOS A MANO, Y A LA VEZ INICIAR UN NEGOCIO EN ESTA TEMPORADA NAVIDE\u00D1A?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EEsta temporada navide\u00F1a es el momento perfecto para comenzar a elaborar y crear adornos de Navidad que sus amigos y familiares seguramente recordar\u00E1n. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EEn este curso aprender\u00E1s a elaborar bolitas de decoraci\u00F3n para tu \u00E1rbol de Navidad.

CART is a predictive algorithm used in Machine learning and it explains how the target variable\u2019s values can be predicted based on other matters. It is a decision tree where each fork is split into a predictor variable and each node has a prediction for the target variable at the end. Classically, this algorithm is referred to as decision trees, but on some platforms like R they are referred to by the more modern term CART. The CART algorithm provides a foundation for important algorithms like bagged decision trees, random forest and boosted decision trees.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs the name suggests, CART (Classification and Regression Trees) can be used for both classification and regression problems. The difference lies in the target variable. That is, With classification, we attempt to predict a class label. In other words, classification is used for problems where the output (target variable) takes a finite set of values, e.g., whether it will rain tomorrow or not. Meanwhile, regression is used to predict a numerical label. This means your output can take an infinite set of values, e.g., a house price.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDecision Trees are an important type of algorithm for predictive modeling machine learning. The classical decision tree algorithms have been around for decades and modern variations like random forest are among the most powerful techniques available. In this post you will discover the humble decision tree algorithm known by it\u2019s more modern name CART which stands for Classification And Regression Trees. The web is full of apps that are driven by data. All the e-commerce apps and websites are based on data in the complete sense. There is database behind a web front end and middleware that talks to a number of other databases and data services. But the mere use of data is not what comprises of data science. A data application gets its value from data and in the process creates value for itself. This means that data science enables the creation of products that are based on data. This course includes learning decision tree modeling which are used by data scientists or people who inspire to be the data scientist.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Decision Tree Algorithm is one of the popular supervised type machine learning algorithms that is used for classifications. This algorithm generates the outcome as the optimized result based upon the tree structure with the conditions or rules. The decision tree algorithm associated with three major components as Decision Nodes, Design Links, and Decision Leaves. It operates with the Splitting, pruning, and tree selection process. It supports both numerical and categorical data to construct the decision tree. Decision tree algorithms are efficient for large data set with less time complexity.

It handles high dimensional data without the need any pre-processing or transformation of the initial data and allows parallel processing for quicker results. The unique feature of Random forest is supervised learning. What it means is that data is segregated into multiple units based on conditions and formed as multiple decision trees. These decision trees have minimal randomness (low Entropy), neatly classified and labeled for structured data searches and validations. Little training is needed to make the data models active in various decision trees.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe success of Random forest depends on the size of the data set. More the merrier. The big volume of data leads to accurate prediction of search results and validations. The big volume of data will have to be logically split into subsets of data using conditions exhaustively covering all attributes of data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDecision trees will have to be built using these sub-sets of data and conditions enlisted. These trees should have enough depth to have the nodes with minimal or nil randomness and their Entropy should reach zero. Nodes should bear labels clearly and it should be an easy task to run through nodes and validate any data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe need to build as many decision trees as possible with clearly defined conditions, and true or false path flow. The end nodes in any decision tree should lead to a unique value. Each and every decision tree is trained and the results are obtained. Random forest is known for its ability to return accurate results even in case of missing data due to its robust data model and sub-set approach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny search or validation should cover all the decision trees and the results are summed up. If any data is missing the true path of that condition is assumed and the search flow continues till all the nodes are consumed.

It is similar to Arduino but smaller and more powerful in terms of\u0026nbsp;hacking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstalling backdoors, exfiltrating documents, or capturing credentials is incredibly easy with a seemingly innocent USB drive called the USB\u0026nbsp; Rubber Ducky. An Expert hacker with a few minutes, photographic memory,\u0026nbsp; and perfect typing accuracy can use a few well-crafted keystrokes to hack virtually anything they have physical access to. However, the proper hardware can do the same thing every time on demand without fail.\u0026nbsp; That\u2019s where the Rubber Ducky and other Human Interface Devices (HID)\u0026nbsp; come into play. They inject keystrokes at superhuman speeds, violating computers\u0027 inherent trust in humans by posing as a keyboard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this class, we\u2019ll learn more about what HID attacks are, how they work,\u0026nbsp; the social engineering that can be involved in their deployment, and how to use them in your Pen-testing engagements. Keyboards announce themselves to computers as HID devices and are in turn automatically recognized and accepted. We\u0027ll program a microcontroller in Arduino to take advantage of this by acting as an HID device. We can then create scripts that run when the device is plugged into a target computer. All at only a fraction of the cost of the more well-branded USB Rubber\u0026nbsp; Ducky!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStudents will learn to use a low-cost Digispark to program their payloads for use in Ethical Hacking and Penetration testing. We\u0027ll go over creating more advanced loads, including tracking payloads that run in the background, as well as Rickroll payloads that can be used with permission from friends and family to demonstrate how HID attacks work. Additionally, students learn to automate nearly anything on an unattended device which can be extremely useful when you need to run the same commands on a series of computers.\u0026nbsp; That\u2019s how the Original USB Ruber Ducky was invented. Hak5 founder\u0026nbsp; Darren Kitchen, while working as a sysadmin, got tired of typing the same commands to fix printers and network shares, again and again, and the device evolved out of laziness. He programmed a development board to emulate the typing for him - and thus the keystroke injection attack was born.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0647\u0644 \u0635\u0646\u0627\u0639\u0647 \u062C\u0647\u0627\u0632 \u0631\u0627\u0628\u0631 \u062F\u0643\u064A\u061F\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u062F\u0639\u0646\u0627 \u0646\u062A\u0639\u0631\u0641 \u0639\u0644\u0649\u0026nbsp;

We live in an era of sound bites and 140 character messages, but good writing still matters when it comes to marketing your business.

If you\u2019ve ever read a poorly-written copy, you know the opposite occurs. You find you\u2019re not focused on the message but rather the awkwardness of the statement or the careless choice of words.

They\u2019re busy. They have other media competing for their attention. Make it easy and enjoyable for them to glide through your paragraphs. Good writing is simple. It\u2019s easy to understand. It lacks unnecessary complexity. The vocabulary is varied but not pretentious. Weed out extra words to improve clarity. Get rid of redundancies, cliches and fluff. Delete energy-sapping words like: very, really, just, quite and rather. What makes writing even more interesting than its style is its substance. Focus on content over craft. Deliver your message in its purest form. Your content will pack more power and inspire a greater response.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Art of Persuasion Begins With Good Copy\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThink of your copy\u2013whether for an ad, brochure or website\u2013as your secret salesperson.

In today\u2019s media-rich world, there\u2019s no shortage of messages competing for your customers\u2019 attention.

Those are all basic questions that you\u2019ll be considering for each new client you get and the answers will help inform your copywriting for that client. In addition to those skills, you need to have a desire to learn. So much of copywriting involves research and learning about your clients and their industries.

The design and implementations are by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike and Ken Thompson.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGo is a very good choice for learning a programming language because it was developed by some of the same people who created the C programming language, Unix, and UTF-8 - some of the most influential contributions to computer science. With Go Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson created a modern programming language that can easily run on multiple processors in parallel, works smoothly in different environments, and makes it easy for programmers to write programs with a very streamlined and user-friendly syntax.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy did Google develop a new programming language?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn Google\u0027s words, \u0022\u003Cem\u003EGo was born out of frustration with existing languages and environments for systems programming.

Programmers who could were choosing ease over safety and efficiency by moving to dynamically typed languages such as Python and JavaScript rather than C\u002B\u002B or, to a lesser extent, Java. Go is an attempt to combine the ease of programming of an interpreted, dynamically typed language with the efficiency and safety of a statically typed, compiled language. It also aims to be modern, with support for networked and multicore computing. \u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EFinally, working with Go is intended to be fast: it should take at most a few seconds to build a large executable on a single computer. To meet these goals required addressing a number of linguistic issues: an expressive but lightweight type system; concurrency and garbage collection; rigid dependency specification; and so on. These cannot be addressed well by libraries or tools; a new language was called for.\u003C/em\u003E\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my humble opinion, Go is the best programming language you can learn today.
