When delays occur, they can disrupt project timelines, increase costs, and impact overall project quality. To address these disruptions, contractors and project owners may file an Extension of Time (EOT) claim. An EOT claim formally requests additional time to complete the project beyond the original deadline, aiming to account for delays not attributable to the contractor\u2019s actions. Properly managing and documenting these claims is crucial for mitigating disputes and ensuring fair adjustments to project schedules.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConstruction claims are formal requests or demands for compensation or adjustments arising from disputes or issues encountered during a construction project. These claims typically involve disagreements over the project\u0027s scope, cost, or schedule, and they can arise between various parties, such as the contractor, subcontractors, suppliers, and the project owner.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn This Course You Can Get Idea about,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat Do We Mean by Delay and Disruption?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDefinitions in Delay and Disruption Analysis\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDelay Analysis and its Methodologies\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFIDIC Claims and Extension of Time Provisions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScenario - Delay Analysis In Action\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFIDIC Resources\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnderstanding and managing construction claims is vital for ensuring that construction projects run smoothly and disputes are resolved efficiently.

Did you build a couple of projects with PHP and MySQL, but you still think you are inexperienced and you are missing out on a lot of things when coming to developing bigger projects? If yes, then this course is the right resource for you. This course is very digestible and informative and it was created specifically to enhance your coding skills and knowledge not just in PHP and MySQL, but overall in developing web projects. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is what we are going to do in this course. Naturally, we are going to get started by setting up the right tools for our projects. And after that, we are going to build our first simple yet very interesting project and that\u0027s a URL shortening service. The second project will be about sending emails in PHP and that\u0027s very important because it\u0027s a feature that almost every website has. The next project will be the starting of something big because it\u0027s an authentication system where I am going to teach you how to develop a login and a register page, how to hash and de-hash passwords, how to do validation and so much more. After this, we are going to build a comments system and this will be the biggest project in this course. We will begin first by doing a post system and then we will grab comments for every post that we have of course we will use Ajax-JQuery for inserting, deleting, and showing comments. after that, we will integrate a rating system into the previous two projects to make a bigger project. So, I will show how to download a JQuery plugin, how to integrate it and how to use it to do the rating system for every post, and so on. And the rating system is going to be implemented of course using Ajax-JQuery. The upcoming project is going to be also created with Ajax and JQuery and that\u0027s a live search system and we will combine it with our big project. The last project will be about building a weather app. All we are going to do is set up a form, allow the user to enter a city, and then give him the current degree of this city. So we will use an API to grab the current degree for this city.

I found this course created by TJ Walker a perfect introduction to the world of media training. I wanted to learn, not only what a media trainer does, but also what steps I would have to take in order to become a successful media trainer--TJ discusses all this in a clear and concise manner, in a tone that is welcoming and never alienating. The only constructive critique I would give would be concerning the technical form of the presentation, more specifically the video quality and picture aesthetic. Going by the current standard as it applies to video, everything we view is in high definition. Having said that, I believe the video quality could be improved upon as well as the backdrop which I found to be a bit generic and outdated. I found these minor flaws to be slightly distracting and given the high caliber of the speaker and the information being presented I believe these aspects detracted, if only marginally, from the quality of the product.\u0022\u0026nbsp;\u003C/em\u003ENick Cisik\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u00225 Stars!
