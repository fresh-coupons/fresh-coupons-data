Managers can offer insights into effective communication, conflict resolution, and building positive relationships, which can significantly impact an employee\u0027s overall quality of life.  In times of personal crisis or uncertainty, such as major life transitions or unexpected challenges, employees may turn to their managers for guidance. Managers trained in coaching can provide a supportive and non-judgmental space for employees to explore their feelings, identify potential solutions, and develop action plans to address these challenges.","coaching techniques have become indispensable in the modern workplace, particularly within the roles of managers and leaders. These skills not only drive career development and internal education but also play a crucial role in supporting the mental health and well-being of employees.  As we navigate an ever-changing professional landscape, organizations that recognize the importance of coaching will not only foster a culture of continuous improvement but also cultivate a loyal and motivated workforce. Managers who embrace coaching as a core aspect of their leadership style will not only elevate their own careers but also become catalysts for the success of their teams and organizations as a whole.  By understanding and implementing coaching techniques effectively, managers can truly transform the workplace into an environment where individuals thrive, careers flourish, and holistic well-being is nurtured."],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":161,"averageValue":"4.5"},"instructors":[{"name":"MTF Institute of Management, Technology and Finance","url":"/user/mtfinstitute/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.32}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"094F5AD4E3E8705512F9","originalPrice":"\u20B91,699","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"1 day","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/software-development-engineering-excellence-master-course/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5663806,"title":"Master in Software Architecture, Engineering and Development","shortDescription":"Best Course for software engineer / developer and team lead for best practices in programming, application security etc","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWant to become Excellent\u0026nbsp; in Software Development\u0026nbsp; but don\u2019t know what to do and how?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake a look at this course where you will\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENot only learn what to do to become Excellent in Software Development but also learn\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHow to adopt the Software Development Excellence Practices from Global Software Leaders.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EPreview many lectures for free to see the content for yourself\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00B7\u003Cstrong\u003EGet Udemy\u2019s 30 days Money Back Guarantee\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGet 4 bonus lectures of my new courses every month through educational announcements\u0026nbsp; in your email\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEnroll for free in my any other course using the coupon link in my YouTube channel videos from time to time subject to availability\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy exposure to Software Development Excellence started when I came in contact with great software development companies like CISCO etc who came to IIM Udaipur to recruit management students to help them maintain and build on their excellence\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI came to know about their requirements from the management students to drive excellence in Software Development\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI went on a journey to discover the best practices following by researching not only the companies visiting IIM Udaipur but also the Best Software Development Companies globally like GitHub, Netflix, Amazon Web Services, Spotify, Google and Microsoft\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI bring in this course my learnings from this journey and sharing with you how can you also become Excellent in Software Development\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELook at what other students like you are saying about this course\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Comprehensive and Insightful Guide to Mastering Software Development.
