It assumes that you\u0027re new to the language, so it gets you started with basic functionality such as creating functions, creating variables, and calling these lines of code from your standard HTML pages. It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are practicals of:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E* Javascript Course Contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Array\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Variables\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Functions\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Objects\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Control Statements\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Cookies\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Loop statements\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESee you inside the course\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-practicals-crash-course/","imageUri":"https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4200228_c917_2.jpg","duration":"38 total mins","enrolledStudentsCount":"111,817.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["For Javascript  Programming Beginners","For People New to Javascript","For People Who want to learn Javascript Fundamentals and later Transition into Web Development"],"tags":["JavaScript"],"rating":{"count":1369,"averageValue":"4.2"},"instructors":[{"name":"PROPER DOT INSTITUTE","url":"/user/vivek-dahibhate-2/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.173077}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"69650C783A083EB49B42","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/guesstimates-and-case-interviews-excellence/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4716500,"title":"Guesstimates \u0026 Business Consulting Case Analysis  Excellence","shortDescription":"Crack Jobs with Big 4 Companies like Bain and Company, McKinsey etc. Become a Management Consultant for any industry","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWant to Crack your consulting interviews and Become a Consultant with great consulting companies?

Definition: Marketing management is the strategic and operational process of planning, organizing, implementing, and controlling an organization\u0027s marketing resources and activities.  Focus: Marketing management aims to create a cohesive marketing plan, optimize resource allocation, and measure the effectiveness of marketing initiatives.  Key Activities:  Developing marketing strategies and plans  Setting marketing budgets  Managing marketing teams  Overseeing marketing campaigns  Analyzing marketing performance (tracking metrics and ROI)  Making adjustments to strategies as needed","The Relationship Between Marketing and Marketing Management  Think of marketing as the actions you take to promote your business, and marketing management as the overarching system to plan, execute, and refine those actions strategically.  Here\u0027s a simple analogy:  Marketing is like cooking a delicious meal. It involves finding the right recipe (products/services), sourcing the best ingredients (market research), and carefully preparing the dish (advertising, promotions).  Marketing Management is like being the head chef. They devise the overall menu (marketing strategy), manage the kitchen staff (marketing teams), ensure the budget is efficient, and keep track of customer feedback (measuring results) to perfect future meals.","Advertising:  Advertising is a form of communication that aims to promote or sell a product, service, or idea. Its purpose is to reach and persuade a target audience through various channels and mediums. The ultimate goal is to create awareness, generate interest, and influence consumer behavior. Advertisements can take many forms, including print ads, radio and TV commercials, online banners, social media posts, billboards, and more. The key elements of advertising include a compelling message, a target audience, and the choice of appropriate media for distribution.","Advertising Management:  Advertising management involves planning, executing, and overseeing an organization\u0027s advertising activities. It is a strategic process that requires making decisions about various aspects of advertising campaigns to achieve specific marketing objectives. Key components of advertising management include:  Strategic Planning: Identifying goals, target audiences, and the overall message to be conveyed. This phase involves market research and analysis to understand consumer behavior and market trends.  Media Planning: Selecting the most effective channels and platforms to reach the target audience. This includes choosing between traditional media (TV, radio, print) and digital media (online ads, social media, email marketing).  Creative Development: Crafting the content and visuals of the advertisements. This includes writing compelling copy, designing visuals, and ensuring consistency with the brand\u0027s messaging and identity.  Budgeting: Allocating financial resources for advertising campaigns. This involves determining how much money to spend on each campaign and allocating funds to different media channels.  Execution: Implementing the advertising plan, which includes negotiating with media outlets, launching campaigns, and monitoring their progress.  Evaluation and Analysis: Assessing the effectiveness of advertising campaigns through various metrics and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). This involves analyzing consumer response, sales data, and other relevant factors to measure the campaign\u0027s success.  Adjustment and Optimization: Based on the evaluation, advertising management may involve making adjustments to future campaigns. This could include refining the target audience, adjusting messaging, or reallocating budget to more successful channels.  Effective advertising management requires a combination of creativity, market knowledge, and analytical skills. It plays a critical role in helping organizations connect with their target audience, build brand awareness, and achieve marketing objectives.
