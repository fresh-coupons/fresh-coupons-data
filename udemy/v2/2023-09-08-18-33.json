You call a meeting to try to convince your boss and peers that your company needs to make an important move\u2014for instance, funding a risky but promising venture. Your argument is impassioned, your logic unassailable, your data bulletproof. Two weeks later, though, you learn that your brilliant proposal has been tabled.

Indeed, far too many decisions go the wrong way because information is presented ineffectively. In our experience, people can vastly improve their chances of having their proposals succeed by determining who the chief decision maker is among the executives they are trying to persuade and then tailoring their arguments to that business leader\u2019s decision-making style.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpecifically, we have found that executives typically fall into one of five decision-making categories: Charismatics can be initially exuberant about a new idea or proposal but will yield a final decision based on a balanced set of information. Thinkers can exhibit contradictory points of view within a single meeting and need to cautiously work through all the options before coming to a decision. Skeptics remain highly suspicious of data that don\u2019t fit with their worldview and make decisions based on their gut feelings. Followers make decisions based on how other trusted executives, or they themselves, have made similar decisions in the past. And controllers focus on the pure facts and analytics of a decision because of their own fears and uncertainties.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe five styles span a wide range of behaviors and characteristics. Controllers, for instance, have a strong aversion to risk; charismatics tend to seek it out. Despite such differences, people frequently use a one-size-fits-all approach when trying to convince their bosses, peers, and staff. They argue their case to a thinker the same way they would to a skeptic. Instead, managers should tailor their presentations to the executives they are trying to persuade, using the right buzzwords to deliver the appropriate information in the most effective sequence and format. After all, Bill Gates does not make decisions in the same way that Larry Ellison does.

A method many use to address this fear is to create presentation slides as a memory aid. However, this can be short-sighted because nothing erodes your credibility as a speaker faster than signaling to the audience that you depend on your slides.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeasoned presenters are able to announce a slide before showing it. At a minimum, they know their material so well that they only need to briefly glance at the slide to know what\u0027s coming next. You can achieve this by doing simple memory-boosting practices to remember your presentation material and, in turn, reduce your anxiety.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emong the most effective tips for memorizing lines is The Palace Method or Mind Palace. The Palace Method is based on research into brain science that has proven a very deep connection between how we remember an event and the space in which it occurred. The brain system important for memory is lso important for space; in other words, we remember things based on spatial locations or \u0022spatial scaffolds.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn a nutshell, The Palace Method is a memory technique that involves transforming what you want to remember into images and placing the images in a familiar mental location. In other words, you\u0027re giving your memories something to hang on to, a spatial anchor. You can then mentally tour your Memory Palace looking at your memories through these spatial anchors to help you recall each memory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are ready enroll now\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/33-memory-techniques-to-remember-anything/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5446692_2404_2.jpg","duration":"34 total mins","enrolledStudentsCount":"1,961.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Everyone who want to improve this skill"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":6,"averageValue":"4.4"},"instructors":[{"name":"ELOUAZZANI HAMZA","url":"/user/hamza-elouazzani/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"753F3F8BEB25E679BE63","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/the-bigtech-system-design-interview-bootcamp/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4722894,"title":"The \u0022BigTech\u0022 System Design Interview Bootcamp","shortDescription":"The Complete Guide to Nail Your Next System Design Interview - Hands-On, Project-Based Learning with Discord Community!","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIt\u0027s 2023 and this is the year, you finally land your dream job in big tech!

Two fundamental principles of Islamic banking are the sharing of profit and loss and the prohibition of the collection and payment of interest by lenders and investors. In Islamic banking, the banks do not collect interests from creditors. Instead, they earn money using equity participation systems and share profits and losses. Islamic finance is practiced in many Muslim countries and is extremely popular among Islamic communities, as some conventional banking practices might be against Shariah. Islamic finance is considered more ethical than conventional banking, as it believes that a bank and its clients should make profits and losses together. Hence, it does not just focus on maximizing the bank\u2019s wealth. Also, Islamic finance practices consider the best interests of the Muslim community.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIslamic banking development can be attributed to some conventional banking theories and practices which go against and hurt the sentiments of the Muslim communities. Hence, Islamic finance was developed by inventing methods that are Sharia-compliant. Sharia is the Islamic law present in the Quran\u2019s teachings. Creating practices that align with the Muslim culture and beliefs encourages many to take up banking. Islamic finance is so strictly followed that banks look to religious leaders and scholars for guidance. The main objective of Islamic banking\u003Cstrong\u003E \u003C/strong\u003Eand finance is that all society participants should create wealth and benefit.

It talks and explains the networking basics which is much more helpful for the beginners who are new to the world and domain of networking. This OSPF Certification course of Routing Protocol OSPF builds a strong foundation for them to prepare for good level certifications like CCNA. You will be able to learn all the terminologies and key functionalities related to routing protocols. There is n number of routing protocols that are developed today but only very few have been adopted by the industry. In this course, all those concepts will be explained in detail and you can practice them at your ease. The broad areas to be covered are related to configurations, operations, and troubleshooting. Apart from that, there are a few use cases of two very popular Routing protocols that work on the principle of OSPF and have their level of advantages. This OSPF Certification Module describes how to connect and configure and operate Open Shortest Path First which was specifically designed for IP networks and therefore supports IP tagging and sub-netting of extremely derived information related to routing. It also allows the packet-based information and authentication to take place and also makes use of the multicast for Internet protocol when either sending or receiving any packet\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis course module named Routing Protocols RIP and EIGRP is quite similar to the one used above and is also responsible to teach you many basics and fundamental concepts such as those related to troubleshooting, operation, and configuration. The two most important routing protocols which will be explained in detail are the RIP also known as Routing information protocol and the other is EIGRP which is the abbreviated form for Extended interior Gateway protocol. In the RIP protocol, the oldest of the vectors for distance IP Routing protocols are still put to use and thereby getting various enhancements. There are currently two versions that exist for the RIP viz. RIPv1 and RIPv2. RIPv1 is also said to be the classful protocol which means that it is not classless whereas if you talk about the RIPv2, it is considered to be the classless support routing protocol and IPv6 is the one whose support is extended to RIPv2 with the next-gen RIP which is also termed as RIPng. EIGRP, on the other hand, is related to the Interior Gateway protocol as it is a proprietary protocol of the company CISCO. This protocol is occasionally described as the distance vector routing protocol which also acts and imitates like a link state-oriented protocol. Distance vector-based protocols share everything of which they are aware of. The only limitation they carry is that the amount of information shared is only among the neighbors which are directly or indirectly connected with each other. Link state-based protocols announce that the information present is only about the direction and not indirectly connected links. However, they are also responsible to share the routing protocol information among themselves in all the areas they deem fit among all the routes in their domain or area.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/cisco-ospf-hands-on-certification-training/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4844382_3644_3.jpg","duration":"10.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"6,792.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["The target audience for this course is anybody who has a keen interest in the field of digital communication and is also aware of how the basics of understanding the networks and other routing protocols and mechanisms such as OSPF Routing.

It represents an asynchronous data stream that can emit multiple values over time. Observables are used extensively in Angular for handling asynchronous operations such as making HTTP requests, handling user events, or managing data streams. Observables can be combined, transformed, filtered, and subscribed to using operators, allowing for efficient data manipulation and handling.

The LiveView programming model is mostly declarative: instead of saying \u0022when event ABC happens, change XYZ on the page\u0022, events in LiveView are managed by handlers bound to event id. Once the state changes, LiveView will re-render the relevant parts of its HTML template(calculate diff) and push it to the browser, which updates itself most efficiently. This means developers write LiveView templates as any other server-rendered HTML and LiveView does the hard work of tracking changes and sending the relevant diffs to the browser using websocket communication. Phoenix Framework widely popularized this approach and there are implementations for many significant languages or platforms.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETopics covered by this course:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/strong\u003EDuring the course, we create a basic web application in Go Lang with a Live(View) approach.

Lists are mutable, meaning their elements can be changed, added, or removed. Tuples, on the other hand, are immutable, and their elements cannot be modified once defined. Lists are also ordered, while tuples are ordered collections. Finally, lists can contain elements of different data types, whereas tuples maintain elements of the same or different data types. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn more at: learn more url here\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPython Sample Question 2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat are metaclasses in Python?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMetaclasses in Python are classes used to define the behavior of other classes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMetaclasses in Python are classes that inherit from multiple base classes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMetaclasses in Python are classes that allow dynamic attribute assignment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMetaclasses in Python are classes used to implement abstract base classes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECorrect Option:\u003C/strong\u003E 1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EExplanation:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMetaclasses in Python are classes that define the behavior and structure of other classes. They provide a way to modify the creation and behavior of classes themselves. Metaclasses are responsible for creating classes, just as classes are responsible for creating instances. They allow you to customize class creation, modify class attributes and methods, and perform various operations on classes. Metaclasses can be useful for implementing advanced patterns, such as creating singleton classes, enforcing coding standards, or automatically adding behavior to classes at runtime. However, metaclasses can be complex and should be used judiciously, as they can introduce additional complexity and may not be necessary for most applications.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn more at: learn more url here\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach question in this course is accompanied by a \u003Cstrong\u003Edetailed explanation and a \u0027Learn More\u0027 link for deeper understanding\u003C/strong\u003E, ensuring your full preparation. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith \u003Cstrong\u003EPython Interview Questions \u0026amp; Answers: Master Your Python Interview\u003C/strong\u003E, you are not just getting ready for an interview; you are setting foot on the path of mastering Python. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease note that we are constantly \u003Cstrong\u003Eupdating our questions and answers\u003C/strong\u003E to ensure that you receive the most \u003Cstrong\u003Eup-to-date content\u003C/strong\u003E.
