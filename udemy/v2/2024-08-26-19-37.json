Many efforts were put over the past decades to better comprehend risk and its nature, which led to the founding of solutions, methodologies, and approaches that can help individuals and organizations to make accurate decisions based on logical reasoning. One of the most helpful frameworks to address enterprise risk is ISO 31000, an international standard that incorporates principles, proven practices, and guidelines on managing risks facing organizations. ISO 31000 provides a framework to help companies effectively manage their risks. It can be used by any organization with no regards to its size, industry, or sector. ISO 31000 may help organizations increase the likelihood of achieving objectives, improve the identification of opportunities and threats and effectively allocate and use resources for risk treatment.

The only constructive critique I would give would be concerning the technical form of the presentation, more specifically the video quality and picture aesthetic. Going by the current standard as it applies to video, everything we view is in high definition. Having said that, I believe the video quality could be improved upon as well as the backdrop which I found to be a bit generic and outdated.

Its usefulness can be appreciated in various ways:  Admissions to Educational Institutions: One of the primary uses of the TOEFL exam is for admission to English-speaking colleges and universities, especially in the United States and many other countries. It serves as a critical evaluation tool for assessing a student\u0027s ability to understand and communicate in English, ensuring they can succeed in an English-speaking academic environment.  Visa and Immigration Requirements: Many countries, including the United States, Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom, use TOEFL scores as part of their visa and immigration requirements. To secure a student visa, work visa, or permanent residency, you may be required to demonstrate your English language proficiency through the TOEFL exam.","Scholarships and Financial Aid: Scholarships and financial aid often require TOEFL scores as a part of their application process. Achieving a higher score can make you a more competitive candidate for such awards.  Professional Licensure and Certification: In some fields, professionals may need to prove their English language skills to obtain a license or certification. For instance, healthcare professionals, such as doctors and nurses, may need TOEFL scores to practice in English-speaking countries.  Employment Opportunities: Some employers, especially multinational corporations, use TOEFL scores as a screening tool during the hiring process. Proficiency in English can be crucial for various job positions, and a good TOEFL score can give you an edge in the job market.  Personal Development: Beyond academic and career-related benefits, taking the TOEFL exam can help individuals assess their English language skills objectively. It can serve as a motivation to improve one\u0027s English language abilities.","As for the importance of special courses for TOEFL preparation, there are several reasons why they can be beneficial:  Structured Approach: MTF TOEFL preparation courses are specifically designed to familiarize test-takers with the format, content, and strategies required for success in the exam. They provide a systematic and organized approach to study.  Experienced Instructors: Specialized TOEFL instructors are knowledgeable about the exam and can provide guidance on areas where you need improvement. They can offer valuable feedback and tips on how to maximize your performance.  Motivation and Discipline: Enrolling in a TOEFL preparation course can help you stay motivated and committed to your study plan. The structure and accountability provided by the course can be instrumental in achieving your target score.","While it is possible to prepare for the TOEFL exam independently, special courses can provide valuable support, structure, and resources to maximize your chances of success, especially if you are looking to achieve a high score and attain specific academic or professional goals."],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":84,"averageValue":"4.4"},"instructors":[{"name":"MTF Institute of Management, Technology and Finance","url":"/user/mtfinstitute/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.4166665},{"name":"Master Everything Academy","url":"","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.4166665}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"6B4C0D2CA090A44D7387","originalPrice":"\u20B91,199","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"3 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/web-development-beginners-to-advanced/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5018456,"title":"Web Design Course for Beginners to Intermediate","shortDescription":"Learn the Basics of HTML, CSS, Wordpress and get Started with Web Design","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EHello Everyone, Welcome to the Web Design Course for Beginners to Intermediate.

Due to the underlying physics of sound production, flutes have a natural \u0022cut\u0022 or a discontinuity when going from the lowest note to the highest note. This discontinuity appears between the notes \u0022\u003Cem\u003Ega\u003C/em\u003E\u0022 and \u0022\u003Cem\u003Ema\u003C/em\u003E\u0022 on a Carnatic flute and between \u0022\u003Cem\u003EMa\u003C/em\u003E\u0022 and \u0022\u003Cem\u003EPa\u003C/em\u003E\u0022 for a Hindustani flute (mainly because of the fingering technique differences). In order to adapt the flute to Carnatic Music, certain modifications were necessary such as the addition of the 7th hole, usage of thicker walled bamboos, the technique of lifting the head to change the angle of embouchure when shifting between \u0022ga\u0022 and \u0022ma\u0022 notes. These innovations enabled artists to perform the Carnatic ragas with all the necessary Gamakas and ornamentations without losing the \u0022Bhaava\u0022 of the raga.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the Hindustani style, it is known as \u003Cstrong\u003EBansuri (\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E6 Holes\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E)\u003C/strong\u003E.
