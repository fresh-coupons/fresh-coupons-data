To get a better idea of the possible demand for used cars in your area, you\u2019ll need to crunch some numbers. By knowing the number of used cars sold in your area every year and month , you can estimate what percentage of the market you will be likely to be able to corner and reach. By locating the average profit per vehicle, you can get an approximate idea of how much profit and money your dealership able to make per year. While the groundwork associated with opening a dealership can be time-consuming, expensive, and demanding, the real test of your dealership\u2019s viability doesn\u2019t begin until after you open your doors to the public. Without the right management of your dealership, all the effort you put into laying the foundation will be wasted. While each state has its own rules and regulations, there are several important universal aspects of operating a car dealership and tips on how you can get the most out of your investment. Your customers are the single most important factor in the success or failure of your business, so taking the time to identify who they are and what they care about is absolutely vital. Take a look at the types of cars you plan on selling, then do some research to determine the age, gender, and income level of the average individual who owns those types of vehicles. Later down the line, this will allow you to tailor your marketing and advertising efforts toward those who are most likely to be interested in what you have to offer. Make sure to base any of your conclusions regarding your target clients on real actionable data; don\u2019t simply make assumptions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/car-flipping-earn-money-from-selling-used-cars-ocsaly/","imageUri":"https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4741312_7b69_3.jpg","duration":"1.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"29,138.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Beginner Used Car Business Leaders"],"tags":["Car Flipping"],"rating":{"count":101,"averageValue":"4.1"},"instructors":[{"name":"OCSALY Academy | 270.000\u002B Students","url":"/user/online-academy-of-computer-science/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"OCSALY-YOUTUBE-1M","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/learn_sql/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5307690,"title":"Learn SQL in 3 Hours : A tutorial for fast learners","shortDescription":"Unlock the Power of Databases and Excel in SQL Mastery: Become a Highly Skilled SQL Developer with Database Knowledge","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EAre you ready to unlock the power of databases and take your SQL skills to the next level?

For example, if there is a rise in temperature it will also lead to a rise in the sales of ice creams. This is called positive correlation. Correlation analysis deals with relationship among variables. The correlation coefficient lets researchers to measure if there is a possible linear relationship between two variables measured on the same subject. The values of the correlation coefficient are always between -1 and \u002B1. There are different types of correlation coefficients used for different situation. The most common is the Pearson correlation coefficient.

It identifies who has power and accountability, and who makes decisions. It is, in essence, a toolkit that enables management and the board to deal more effectively with the challenges of running a company. Corporate governance ensures that businesses have appropriate decision-making processes and controls in place so that the interests of all stakeholders (shareholders, employees, suppliers, customers and the community) are balanced. Good corporate governance can benefit investors and other stakeholders, while bad governance can lead to scandal and ruin. Governance refers to the set of rules, controls, policies, and resolutions put in place to direct corporate behavior. A board of directors is pivotal in governance, while proxy advisors and shareholders are important stakeholders who can affect governance. Communicating a company\u0027s corporate governance is a key component of community and investor relations. For instance, Apple Inc.\u0027s investor relations site profiles its corporate leadership (the executive team and board of directors) and provides information on its committee charters and governance documents, such as bylaws, stock ownership guidelines, and articles of incorporation. Most successful companies strive to have exemplary corporate governance. For many shareholders, it is not enough for a company to be profitable; it also must demonstrate good corporate citizenship through environmental awareness, ethical behavior, and other sound corporate governance practices.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/corporate-governance-us-and-uk-markets/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5621750_ba49.jpg","duration":"2.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"1,398.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Bankers, Accountants, Stakeholders of a company, Anyone who wants to learn about corporate governance"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":0,"averageValue":"0.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"EDUCBA Bridging the Gap","url":"/user/premananda-suna/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":0}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"EDUCBABF19","originalPrice":"\u20B91,999","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/linux-modules/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4999750,"title":"Linux Modules","shortDescription":"Intermediate Commands","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EThis course teaches you intermediate Linux commands.

This is starting to happen with Android app development. Developers who used to use Java are switching to Kotlin. You can see why Google want this to happen.

This means that Java is free for development and test environments, but for commercial purposes, a small fee is required.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E8. Java is Platform Independent:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EJava is platform-independent as the Java source code is converted to byte code by the compiler which can then be executed on any platform using the Java Virtual Machine. Java is also known as a WORA (write once, run anywhere) language because it is platform-independent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the development of most Java applications occurs in a Windows environment while they are run on a UNIX platform because of the platform-independent nature of Java.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E9. Java has great Documentation Support:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe documentation support for Java is excellent using \u003Cstrong\u003EJavadoc\u003C/strong\u003E which is the documentation generator for Java. It uses the Java source code to generate the API documentation in HTML format. So, Javadoc provides a great reference while coding in Java so that understanding the code is quite simple.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E10. Java is Versatile:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EJava is very versatile as it is used for programming applications on the web, mobile, desktop, etc. using different platforms. Also, Java has many features such as dynamic coding, multiple security features, platform-independent characteristics, network-centric designing, etc. that make it quite versatile.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to learn Java from scratch without any prior experience in programming then you should go for \u003Cstrong\u003EJava Foundation Course\u003C/strong\u003E.

It was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994. The PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group. PHP originally stood for \u003Cem\u003EPersonal Home Page\u003C/em\u003E, but it now stands for the recursive initialism \u003Cem\u003EPHP: Hypertext Preprocessor\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPHP code is usually processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module, a daemon, or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. On a web server, the result of the interpreted and executed PHP code \u2013 which may be any type of data, such as generated HTML or binary image data \u2013 would form the whole or part of an HTTP response. Various web template systems, web content management systems, and web frameworks exist which can be employed to orchestrate or facilitate the generation of that response. Additionally, PHP can be used for many programming tasks outside of the web context, such as standalone graphical applications and robotic drone control. Arbitrary PHP code can also be interpreted and executed via a command-line interface (CLI).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe standard PHP interpreter, powered by the Zend Engine, is free software released under the PHP License. PHP has been widely ported and can be deployed on most web servers on almost every operating system and platform, free of charge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe PHP language evolved without a written formal specification or standard until 2014, with the original implementation acting as the \u003Cem\u003Ede facto\u003C/em\u003E standard which other implementations aimed to follow. Since 2014, work has gone on to create a formal PHP specification.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs of January 2021, 72% of PHP websites use discontinued versions of PHP, i.e. PHP 7.2 or lower, which are no longer supported by The PHP Development Team. A large additional fraction uses PHP 7.3, which is only (up to December 6, 2021) \u0022supported for critical security issues only.\u0022 Over 40% of all PHP websites use version 5.6 or older, which not even Debian supports (Debian 9 supported version 7.0 and 7.1).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBeginner Friendliness\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEasy to Get Started With\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPHP was designed to make web development easier, and many beginners find it effortless to pick up and get started with. In fact, PHP code was so easy to pick up, many non-programmers end up being able to hack PHP code together without truly understanding the code. While good programmers will never copy and paste code they don\u0027t understand, this speaks volumes about how easy it is to pick up PHP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe latest version of PHP (PHP8) has fixed a lot of inconsistencies and fatal errors as well.

Until a panic attack saved me by forcing me to radically change my life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally I found out that panic attacks and anxiety were meant to warn and protect me.

And you will see white and black notes as you see in a piano. I have deigned this course in such a way that most of the lectures in this course are interactive video lectures where I have recorded my mobile screen. So you will see on your mobile, laptop, desktop etc the full screen of my mobile phone and you will listen my voice while learning, \u0026amp; you\u0026nbsp; will also listen the voice of the keyboard when I will touch any key on my touch mobile. You will also see the touched key pressed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can learn by 2 methods, one that if you have a desktop or laptop, you start my course there and you should playing what I am teaching you on your mobile.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other method is that you open my course on your mobile browser on desktop version and start it. Before that, it\u0027s better to open the organ app of keyboared which you will download from android play store or apple store. So after listening my course \u0026amp; understanding, mimize the browser after pausing the video tutorial and open the app and start practicing what you have seen. After that, you will again go to browser to start the course from where you left. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst method has the advantage that while you watch, you can play on your mobile phone. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second method has the advantage that you can learn on the go where ever you are.

Even, a person who has never touch keyboard can learn with course.

Hopefully, by then, you will yourself be in the position to create the melody of any song you want or ever wished to play in thev voice like Flute, violin, guitar etc, and imagine, if you can play what the singer is singing (vocals) on your keyboard called (Lead) in any of your favorite instrument\u0027s voice, it will really be a\u0026nbsp; dream come true if you are a\u0026nbsp; passionate lover and learner of music. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIsn\u0027t it exciting thing\u0026nbsp; that you not need to buy even a keyboard.

You may even attach your mobile to speaker to play in a family or friends gathering after you have got the confidence. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven more exciting is that as the sound is produced from mobile, there are no issues of recording. And if you buy a real keyboard or harmonium/Harmonica, you will play it in the same way as you will learn in this course. If you like this course, you may ask for Flute \u0026amp; violin lessons if you may want.

Kotlin has classes with constructors, along with nested, inner, and anonymous inner classes, and it has interfaces like Java 8. Kotlin does \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E have a new keyword. To create a class instance, call the constructor just like a regular function. We saw that in the screenshot above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKotlin has single inheritance from a named superclass, and all Kotlin classes have a default superclass Any, which is \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E the same as the Java base class java.lang.Object. Any contains only three predefined member functions: equals(), hashCode(), and toString().\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKotlin classes have to be marked with the open keyword in order to allow other classes to inherit from them; Java classes are kind of the opposite, as they are inheritable \u003Cem\u003Eunless\u003C/em\u003E marked with the final keyword. To override a superclass method, the method itself must be marked open, and the subclass method must be marked override. This is all of a piece with Kotlin\u2019s philosophy of making things explicit rather than relying on defaults. In this particular case, I can see where Kotlin\u2019s way of explicitly marking base class members as open for inheritance and derived class members as overrides avoids several kinds of common Java errors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, you\u0027ll learn how to create apps and run them on virtual devices through guided exercises. You\u0027ll cover the fundamentals of Android development, from structuring an app to building out the UI with Activities and Fragments and various navigation patterns. Progressing through the chapters and lectures, you\u0027ll delve into Android\u0027s RecyclerView to make the most of displaying lists of data and become comfortable with fetching data from a web service and handling images. You\u0027ll then learn about mapping, location services, and the permissions model before working with notifications and how to persist data. Moving on, you\u0027ll get to grips with testing, covering the full spectrum of the test pyramid. You\u0027ll also learn how AAC (Android Architecture Components) are used to cleanly structure your code and explore various architecture patterns and the benefits of dependency injection. \u003Cem\u003EThe core libraries of RxJava and Coroutines are covered for asynchronous programming\u003C/em\u003E. The focus then returns to the UI, demonstrating how to add motion and transitions when users interact with your apps. Towards the end, you\u0027ll build an interesting app to retrieve and display popular movies from a movie database, and then see how to publish your apps on Google Play.

The goal of computer forensics is to perform a structured investigation and maintain a documented chain of evidence to find out exactly what happened on a computing device and who was responsible for it. Computer forensics -- which is sometimes referred to as computer forensic science essentially is data recovery with legal compliance guidelines to make the information admissible in legal proceedings. The terms digital forensics and cyber forensics are often used as synonyms for computer forensics. Digital forensics starts with the collection of information in a way that maintains its integrity. Investigators then analyze the data or system to determine if it was changed, how it was changed and who made the changes. The use of computer forensics isn\u0027t always tied to a crime. The forensic process is also used as part of data recovery processes to gather data from a crashed server, failed drive, reformatted operating system (OS) or other situation where a system has unexpectedly stopped working.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy is computer forensics important?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the civil and criminal justice system, computer forensics helps ensure the integrity of digital evidence presented in court cases.

The term digital forensics was originally used as a synonym for \u003Cstrong\u003Ecomputer forensics\u003C/strong\u003E but has expanded to cover investigation of all devices capable of storing digital data. With roots in the personal computing revolution of the late 1970s and early 1980s, the discipline evolved in a haphazard manner during the 1990s, and it was not until the early 21st century that national policies emerged.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDigital forensics investigations have a variety of applications. The most common is to support or refute a hypothesis before criminal or civil courts. Criminal cases involve the alleged breaking of laws that are defined by legislation and that are enforced by the police and prosecuted by the state, such as theft and assault against the person. Civil cases on the other hand deal with protecting the rights and property of individuals (often associated with family disputes) but may also be concerned with contractual disputes between commercial entities where a form of digital forensics referred to as electronic discovery (discovery) may be involved\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring the 1980s very few specialized digital forensic tools existed, and consequently investigators often performed live analysis on media, examining computers from within the operating system using existing sysadmin tools to extract evidence. This practice carried the risk of modifying data on the disk, either inadvertently or otherwise, which led to claims of evidence tampering. A number of tools were created during the early 1990s to address the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDigital forensics is commonly used in both criminal law and private investigation. Traditionally it has been associated with criminal law, where evidence is collected to support or oppose a hypothesis before the courts. As with other areas of forensics this is often a part of a wider investigation spanning a number of disciplines. In some cases, the collected evidence is used as a form of intelligence gathering, used for other purposes than court proceedings (for example to locate, identify or halt other crimes). As a result, intelligence gathering is sometimes held to a less strict forensic standard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you enroll in our Digital Forensics Masterclass | Forensic Science 2023 DFMC, you\u0027ll not only learn about the fundamentals of digital forensics, but so much more!

Digital cameras\u003Cstrong\u003E \u003C/strong\u003Eare built into doorbells; your smartphone tracks your daily movements from work to home and back; and you receive social media updates when you go to the gym, see a show, or visit a new city. Digital technology tracks your phone calls, bank transactions, and medical appointments. What about criminal or unethical behavior if it tracks your mundane daily activities?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat activity is also monitored, and as a\u003Cstrong\u003E \u003C/strong\u003Edigital forensic investigator, you\u0027ll need to understand where digital evidence is stored and how to analyse it. There is almost no criminal activity that does not involve digital evidence, and it is your responsibility as an investigator to gather all available evidence, process it, and present your findings to the authorities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInvestigators who work in the field of digital forensics must have a diverse set of skills and interests. The first question I ask anyone thinking about a career in this field is if they enjoy solving puzzles. You may not have access to any information other than the fact that something happened when investigating a case. So, if someone needs to be shown or told what happened, this field may not be right for them. When a case is brought to an investigator\u0027s attention, the investigator is often given instructions to figure out what the computer or device was used for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother important trait is the ability to deal with frustration, as investigative tools and software do not always work without problems. When it comes to cell phones and small devices, this is a fairly common occurrence. Many students, rather than working through the challenges, stop their investigation in class at the first sign of difficulty. They don\u0027t even try to figure out what\u0027s wrong with the tool by looking at the web or using the help system. To be a successful investigator, one must be persistent and creative \u2013 they must be problem solvers. Digital forensics is a branch of forensic science that collects, analyses, documents, and presents digital evidence related to computer crime for use in a court of law using scientific knowledge. Knowing what was done, when it was done, and who did it is the ultimate goal. The term \u201Cdigital forensics\u201D is often used interchangeably with \u201Ccomputer forensics\u201D (also known as \u201Ccyber forensics\u201D), but it has come to encompass all devices capable of storing digital data, including networking devices, mobile phones, tablets, digital cameras, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, digital home appliances, and other digital storage media such as CD/DVD, USB drives, SD cards, external drives, and backup tapes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComputer Forensics is a specialization that deals with the recovery, examination and investigation of digital evidence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComputer Forensics is an applied science that deals with the recovery, examination and investigation of digital evidence.

Linked lists are efficient because they can be dynamically allocated and are flexible in size. However, they can be more complicated to implement and use than other data structures like arrays.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStacks and queues are also important data structures that are commonly used in software development. Stacks use the \u0022last in, first out\u0022 (LIFO) principle, while queues use the \u0022first in, first out\u0022 (FIFO) principle. These data structures are useful for managing data in a specific order, and we will learn how to implement and use them in our class.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrees are another popular data structure that we will cover in our class. Trees are useful for organizing data in a hierarchical structure and are often used in computer science applications like file systems, databases, and search engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to data structures, we will also cover the basics of OOP in C\u002B\u002B.
