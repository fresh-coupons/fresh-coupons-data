It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables.

It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E*\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E javascript course contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript introduction\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript array\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript variables\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript functions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript objects\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript control statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript cookies\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript loop statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript data structures\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript error handling\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript regular expressions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003Esection 2- learn PHP\u0026nbsp;programming language\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis section will learn the basic structure of a web application and how a web browser interacts with a web server.

Designed to enable learners to grapple with the complexities of cost accounting in a simplified and structured manner, this course is perfect for anyone seeking to augment their understanding of managerial accounting processes, particularly those revolving around job cost systems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStarting with an introduction to managerial accounting topics, we delve into the nuanced realm of job cost systems and process cost systems. Recognizing that these two systems form the backbone of manufacturing cost accounting, we undertake a thorough comparative analysis to help you understand when and why a company would employ either of these systems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe place significant emphasis on the classification of costs, dissecting its importance, and demonstrating various methodologies to classify costs effectively. This understanding is fundamental, as it forms the basis of cost flow in the accounting process within manufacturing companies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDigging deeper into the job cost system, we traverse the intricate pathways of inventory cost flows. You\u0027ll gain insights into the movement of costs associated with raw materials, through work in process and factory overhead, before they culminate in finished goods and are eventually expensed as cost of goods sold.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to theoretical aspects, we explore practical elements of a job cost system by discussing key documents integral to recording cost flows. We tackle overhead costs, a vital yet often misunderstood aspect of job cost systems. By clarifying the concept of actual overhead and estimated overhead applied to jobs, you\u0027ll learn to calculate the predetermined overhead rate, a crucial tool for estimating overhead allocations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA significant portion of the course is dedicated to the practical application of knowledge acquired. We walk you through the recording of journal entries pertaining to costs at various stages of the job cost system. From transferring raw materials to work in process and factory overhead, to managing direct and indirect wages, to closing out finished jobs and recording the sale and costs of finished jobs - you\u0027ll be given hands-on exposure to real-world accounting scenarios.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith an emphasis on student interaction, this course also introduces discussion questions aimed at facilitating productive conversations between peers. These discussions offer the opportunity to approach the subject matter from multiple perspectives, enriching your overall learning experience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOur course comes bundled with valuable resources to reinforce your understanding.
