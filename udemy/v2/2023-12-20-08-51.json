The Google Ads platform focuses on Pay Per Click (PPC) ads, where advertisers pay per impression on an ad.

Best practice is to use the Conversions API in addition to the Facebook pixel to help maximize the effectiveness of your website events.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Conversions API is designed to create a direct and reliable connection between marketing data (such as website events and offline conversions) from your server, website platform or CRM to Facebook. This marketing data helps power ad personalization, optimization and measurement on Facebook so that your ads are shown to people who are more likely to be interested in them. There are several options you can use to set up the Conversions API. Many integrations don\u0027t require a developer, and if you use a commerce platform such as Shopify you can set up the Conversions API in just a few clicks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThe Conversions API can help you to:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReduce your cost per action as a result of improved connectivity.

One type of marketing data is website events, which are actions that people take on your website. For example, making a purchase or adding an item to their cart. As people interact with your business, integration methods like the Conversions API and Facebook pixel share those events with Facebook. Events help power your Facebook ads so you can reach a more relevant audience, provide a more personalized ad experience and optimize your ad campaigns towards better business outcomes. Events take place either as a result of Facebook ads (paid) or organic reach (unpaid).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELearn How to Use, Setup \u0026amp; Optimise Meta Aggregated Events\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFacebook\u2019s Aggregated Event Measurement is a protocol that allows for measurement of web events from iOS 14 users.
