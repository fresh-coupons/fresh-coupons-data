He\u0027s not simply some guy who\u0027s always liked to draw, got a microphone for Christmas and thought it\u0027d be cool to make a course. I regard myself as an exceptionally unexceptional draftsman but can already sense some improvement in the way I\u0027m tackling portraits.The value I\u0027ve already received leaves me with absolutely no complaints. You\u0027ll be getting A LOT of information from a guy who knows what he\u0027s doing with this course. And the demos - from blank sheet of paper to finished, fully rendered drawing - are both highly informative and inspirational. I\u0027m not sure you can ask for more than that from any instructor.

Chris\u0027s sense of art teaching is excellent, it\u0027s like hanging out in his studio, looking over his shoulder (literally sometimes) and learning from following a professional. He talks out loud what goes on in his thoughts as he mindfully works his image. Seeing him work really helps me. His own career is used as an example, and I love all the personal stories that talk about his journey in the art world and specifically in this field of drawing portraits. The course is full of gold nuggets of info, stories, metaphors that help me put words and structure in my work. (I love the \u0022Valley of the Suck\u0022\u003Cstrong\u003E \u003C/strong\u003Econcept\u2013so true! ) This course really helped me to clarify my work in regards to values. Also, it helps to come back to those foundations of the underlying structure of the face. I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to build a strong foundation and seriously wants to get into portrait art. As it is in my case, I would recommend it as well to any professional that wants to come back and touch those foundations again, one tends to forget stuff!

If that were only possible!?!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reality is that things do not stay the same, things are always changing. This is true with personal development, parenting, relationships and everything in life. Granted change happens at different rates, some so slow barely detectable yet things change. In the world of personal development, parenting \u0026amp; relationship development coming to grips with change and managing the change aka change management can be daunting. Reason is, that so much of the change is beyond our control. Yet we do have control over some of the change and we certainly have control of how we respond to change and how we manage change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother truth is that time and change are related. We see change based upon time and we measure change by time and vise versa. The time element can create issues for us. If change doesn\u2019t happen in the time we believe it should we can get frustrated and quit doing our part to direct change to our liking. In parenting this happens all the time. We may try a new way of addressing our children and if they don\u2019t respond as the \u201Cbook\u201D says then \u201Cour child\u201D must be the \u201Cexception to rule\u201D. So we quit. It didn\u0027t work. Why? Because we often see change as two steps, Old way and New way. But in truth there are six main steps connected by bridges with each step having a cycle of steps. There are changes within ourselves and with our children that will operate at different rates. So when we see Old way expecting new way to happen along with our expectations of when the new way should replace old way, we can feel as if change isn\u2019t happening. \u003Cstrong\u003EHowever, if we understand the method of change and its framework we could actually recognize change happening and where we are during the process of change. This gives us a measure of where we are on the journey of change. This shows us the progression of change. And that we are making an impact even when it appears ( especially in the beginning ) we are not. The recognition of our control of change gives us the confidence and will power to continue on the journey of directed change.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHelp Me I\u0027m a parent! : Method Change, Peaceful Management is designed to show you change, what it looks like, how the process is broken down so that you can see where you are in the process of change, so you wont quit, so you\u2019ll achieve the change you are looking for, sooner rather than later or never.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m Coach Hall your instructor for Help Me I\u0027m a parent! : Method Change, Peaceful Management.

initial stage, which is theoretical lectures, then moving to the second stage, which is a practical session from a certified lecturer at the College of Computers and Information, which begins with you step by step in building a strong mentality towards the field of programming and gradually building methods for writing code in the C language in an effective way. In the lecture, we explain the basic theoretical details, in addition to having a practical application for them, then proceed with a practical application session that teaches you ways of thinking and how to apply what you have learned in what is called logical thinking, and apply it in code simply on the code editor, with all the explanation files, codes, and files for the session deliverables. The course ends with a graduation project, welcome. To enter greater programming stages and launch into the field of programming after acquiring everything you need to be a successful and effective programmer from this course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp; The course is explained by a lecturer at the Faculty of Computers and Information, who holds a master\u2019s degree in computer science, and holds a scholarship from the Ministry of Communications to track the basics of programming, and more than 5 years of experience in the labor market, and the founder of Application.

Did you build a couple of projects with PHP and MySQL, but you still think you are inexperienced and you are missing out on a lot of things when coming to developing bigger projects? If yes, then this course is the right resource for you. This course is very digestible and informative and it was created specifically to enhance your coding skills and knowledge not just in PHP and MySQL, but overall in developing web projects. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is what we are going to do in this course. Naturally, we are going to get started by setting up the right tools for our projects. And after that, we are going to build our first simple yet very interesting project and that\u0027s a URL shortening service. The second project will be about sending emails in PHP and that\u0027s very important because it\u0027s a feature that almost every website has. The next project will be the starting of something big because it\u0027s an authentication system where I am going to teach you how to develop a login and a register page, how to hash and de-hash passwords, how to do validation and so much more. After this, we are going to build a comments system and this will be the biggest project in this course. We will begin first by doing a post system and then we will grab comments for every post that we have of course we will use Ajax-JQuery for inserting, deleting, and showing comments. after that, we will integrate a rating system into the previous two projects to make a bigger project. So, I will show how to download a JQuery plugin, how to integrate it and how to use it to do the rating system for every post, and so on. And the rating system is going to be implemented of course using Ajax-JQuery. The upcoming project is going to be also created with Ajax and JQuery and that\u0027s a live search system and we will combine it with our big project. The last project will be about building a weather app. All we are going to do is set up a form, allow the user to enter a city, and then give him the current degree of this city. So we will use an API to grab the current degree for this city.

In the beginning, we will have three projects. It doesn\u0027t sound like much, but they will give a fantastic idea of what is needed to basically understand how most of the plugins work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the first project, we will create a highly dynamic and fully customizable slideshow plugin. We will start with simple subjects such as directory structuring, methods of installing, deactivating, and uninstalling plugins. Then we will move on to intermediate topics such as CPT creation, the Metabox API (used to create custom fields), we will learn how to manipulate the database by adding and updating values in the metadata tables. We will learn how to control menus and submenus throughout the WordPress admin area.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso within this first project, we will learn to master APIs such as Settings, Options, and the Shortcode API. We will use everything we learn in this section to control the appearance and behavior of the slideshow on the frontend.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second project is a testimonial plugin. It looks simple, but the number of techniques that you will learn will surprise you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this project, we will review some subjects that you will have already seen in the previous section, and learn some new ones. We will learn a lot about the Widgets API and also how to control the HTML templates used in your plugin, including learning how to implement a simple template override system, which also includes learning how to create a specific theme_support for your plugin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe third project is the most complete and the most complex of the three. Have you ever needed to create custom tables for your plugin? Do you have any idea how some of the best-known plugins, like WooCommerce (just to name one of them), do to create and manage tables outside of the WordPress realms? Do you know why they do this, what are the advantages and disadvantages? No? Great, because you are going to learn that in this course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the third project, you will learn about the WordPress $wpdb class, the one responsible for managing all the custom table CRUD operations in your application. You will learn how to create tables, run queries, add, update, and remove data from those tables, using various APIs that you have learned to master during the course, such as the Metabox and Shortcode APIs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou will learn how to synchronize these actions so that your table works in tandem with the native WordPress tables. In addition, in this section, you will see how to provide a frontend interface where the site user can submit data, without having to access the WordPress admin. We will also see how to use WordPress\u0027 own user control system to manage user actions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWho is this course for?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI recommend this course for programmers, IT students, web developers, web designers, or any freelancer or professional who works with PHP, HTML, and CSS. It is recommended that you have notions of object-oriented PHP because all plugins created in the course are based on classes and objects. It is also important that you know how to use the main MySQL commands.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther than that, all professionals who want to learn how to create plugins are welcome. It is only necessary that you already have previous contact with WordPress and know how to install it on a local server at least.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHow is this course \u003Cem\u003Edifferent\u003C/em\u003E?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat my students like most is my excellent response time to their questions.

This course covers an extensive amount of material and by the end you will be proficient enough with AWS to gain an entry level position in cloud administration.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe curriculum starts off with exploring AWS account registration, billing and multi-factor authentication. We then explore more advanced account security through AWS identity and access management (IAM). IAM is an integral part of AWS that facilitates the management of users, groups, and security policies that control AWS resources. Here, we explore the creation of IAM users with varying degrees of account access. This includes user groups, permission policies, and IAM roles for EC2.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOnce students have a firm understanding of IAM, we dive into the backbone of AWS by exploring EC2 instance deployment and configuration. EC2 is a core service of AWS that facilitates the launch of virtual servers (called instances) within the AWS cloud console. We cover how to launch and configure EC2 instances, including choosing the right instance type and setting up security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic. We also explore remote instance administration using PuTTY and Terminal to issue server commands and manage instances from any remote location. Students learn to deploy and assign elastic IP addresses along with the creation of Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) to save instance state and quickly launch new instances with replicated configurations.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAfter completion of the EC2 module, we jump into AWS storage solutions where we explore various storage types including, block, file and object storage. More specifically students learn to harness the power of the Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) and the Amazon Elastic File System (EFS). We demonstrate how to deploy and configure multiple EBS volumes and attach them to existing instances for maximum scalability. Students also learn to design and deploy seamlessly scalable storage systems using EFS. We demonstrate how to mount multiple instances to a single EFS endpoint for centralized access to data files. We complete the module by showcasing the power of EBS snapshots and Amazon Machine Images for efficient instance deployment and backups.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EFrom this point, the course branches into more intermediate concepts by exploring elastic load balancing (ELB), Auto Scaling Groups (ASG), and Route 53. Student will learn to deploy a highly available architecture that auto scales based on real-time traffic workload and instance health checks. Traffic will be routed directly through Amazons Route 53 DNS service, with customized domain names and pre-configured hosted zones.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EBy the end of this course, you will have a solid understanding of how to use AWS to build and deploy your own cloud-based infrastructure. You will be able to launch and configure EC2 instances, store and manage data in the cloud, and use services like ELB and ASG to scale your infrastructure to meet the needs of your applications.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIf you\u0027re excited about expanding your knowledge in AWS and the field of cloud computing, hit the enroll button and let\u0027s get started.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-beginner-to-intermediate-ec2-iam-elb-asg-route-53/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5029488_f4fc_5.jpg","duration":"9.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"19,081.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Students interested in Cloud Computing with AWS","Students interested in learning the foundations of Amazon Web Services","Students interested in administering AWS accounts using Identity and Access Management (IAM)","Students interested in securing AWS accounts by assigning Access Privileges to IAM Users","Students interested in deploying Virtual Servers on AWS","Cloud Computing Enthusiasts looking to gain knowledge on using AWS","Students interested in learning about the Amazon EC2 Service","Students interested in learning various AWS Storage Solutions for EC2 (EBS, EFS)","Students interested in learning Dynamic Scaling, Elastic Load Balancing, and Auto Scaling Groups","Students interested in Managing Domain hosted zones using Amazon Route 53"],"tags":["Cloud Computing","Amazon EC2"],"rating":{"count":89,"averageValue":"4.6"},"instructors":[{"name":"YouAccel Training","url":"/user/youaccel/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.576087}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"YOUACCEL87768","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"3 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/cloud-computing-essentials-linode-linux-and-lamp-stack/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5035140,"title":"Cloud Computing Essentials: Linode, Linux, and LAMP Stack","shortDescription":"From Beginner to Pro: A Comprehensive Guide to Cloud Computing with Linode, Linux, and LAMP Stack","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EThis course will provide students with a comprehensive understanding of cloud computing, Linux, and LAMP stack.
