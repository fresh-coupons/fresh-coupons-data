Menu items are explored and explained. Alternative routes to doing the same actions are also explained. Examples are worked through at a very good pace and the videos are not overwhelming. There is no homework, which means that you can actually focus on soaking in the material. Feel free to stop, edit your own confluence and explore, without the pressure of an assignment behind it. I thought everything in the video was helpful and even learned a couple new tricks on how to structure my spaces. There are a variety of use-case scenarios that give you an idea of how to use this tool in different ways (which happens to be my favorite part). Useful demonstrations on layouts, permissions, status changes, drop down menus and more. Confluence is a Canvass that can be used as a great communication platform.

It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat is the Linear regression technique of Machine learning?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELinear Regression is a simple machine learning model for regression problems, i.e., when the target variable is a real value.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELinear regression is a linear model, e.g. a model that assumes a linear relationship between the input variables (x) and the single output variable (y). More specifically, that y can be calculated from a linear combination of the input variables (x).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen there is a single input variable (x), the method is referred to as simple linear regression.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen there are multiple input variables, the method is known as multiple linear regression.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy learn Linear regression technique of Machine learning?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are four reasons to learn Linear regression technique of Machine learning:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Linear Regression is the most popular machine learning technique\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Linear Regression has fairly good prediction accuracy\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Linear Regression is simple to implement and easy to interpret\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. It gives you a firm base to start learning other advanced techniques of Machine Learning\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHow much time does it take to learn Linear regression technique of machine learning?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELinear Regression is easy but no one can determine the learning time it takes. It totally depends on you. The method we adopted to help you learn Linear regression starts from the basics and takes you to advanced level within hours. You can follow the same, but remember you can learn nothing without practicing it. Practice is the only way to remember whatever you have learnt. Therefore, we have also provided you with another data set to work on as a separate project of Linear regression.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat are the steps I should follow to be able to build a Machine Learning model?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can divide your learning process into 4 parts:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStatistics and Probability - Implementing Machine learning techniques require basic knowledge of Statistics and probability concepts. Second section of the course covers this part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnderstanding of Machine learning - Fourth section helps you understand the terms and concepts associated with Machine learning and gives you the steps to be followed to build a machine learning model\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProgramming Experience - A significant part of machine learning is programming. Python and R clearly stand out to be the leaders in the recent days. Third section will help you set up the Python environment and teach you some basic operations. In later sections there is a video on how to implement each concept taught in theory lecture in Python\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnderstanding of Linear Regression modelling - Having a good knowledge of Linear Regression gives you a solid understanding of how machine learning works. Even though Linear regression is the simplest technique of Machine learning, it is still the most popular one with fairly good prediction ability. Fifth and sixth section cover Linear regression topic end-to-end and with each theory lecture comes a corresponding practical lecture where we actually run each query with you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy use Python for data Machine Learning?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnderstanding Python is one of the valuable skills needed for a career in Machine Learning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough it hasn\u2019t always been, Python is the programming language of choice for data science. Here\u2019s a brief history:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; In 2016, it overtook R on Kaggle, the premier platform for data science competitions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; In 2017, it overtook R on KDNuggets\u2019s annual poll of data scientists\u2019 most used tools.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; In 2018, 66% of data scientists reported using Python daily, making it the number one tool for analytics professionals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMachine Learning experts expect this trend to continue with increasing development in the Python ecosystem. And while your journey to learn Python programming may be just beginning, it\u2019s nice to know that employment opportunities are abundant (and growing) as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat is the difference between Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPut simply, machine learning and data mining use the same algorithms and techniques as data mining, except the kinds of predictions vary. While data mining discovers previously unknown patterns and knowledge, machine learning reproduces known patterns and knowledge\u2014and further automatically applies that information to data, decision-making, and actions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDeep learning, on the other hand, uses advanced computing power and special types of neural networks and applies them to large amounts of data to learn, understand, and identify complicated patterns.
