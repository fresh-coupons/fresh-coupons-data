often our approach to security, whether it\u2019s security for our home, our workplace, our families or our own self-defense is merely reactive. These responses are insufficient. Action is always quicker than reaction and these methods of traditional security consistently give the violent criminal the upper hand. Even the skilled self-defense or security practitioner is left at the mercy of an attacker. The average citizen is just waiting around ready to be victimized. The criminal has all of the control. However, there is an answer. There is a way to take control, to be empowered to stop violence and crime before it ever starts. The world of espionage offers us several techniques to be proactive and take control over our security and the protection of those we love. This covert world is more dangerous than the world most of us live in. It\u2019s a world where overlooked vulnerabilities can have deadly consequences.

Soerin guided me through the different research phases, from the literature review until the conclusion and recommendations. By asking probing questions instead of immediately giving the answers to my questions, Soerin not only contributed to a thesis that I\u2019m proud of, but also made me a better researcher. The recommendations that Soerin gave during his review of my thesis drafts were helpful and often formed the basis of new insights. When I hit a block while working on a factor analysis, Soerin helped me via a Skype session during which he looked at my SPSS and SmartPLS output live. Because of his enthusiasm, positive attitude and \u201Ccan do\u201D mentality, my interactions with Soerin were always pleasant and motivating.\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ESoerin, many thanks for your support!\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKevin \u003Cbr\u003EMaster of Science in Accountancy\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u0022I would definitely recommend Soerin as thesis advisor. Not only does Soerin help with the students plan for research, he also helps to\u0026nbsp;improve the plan by making recommendations for advanced research (and additional analyses). Soerin is a very\u0026nbsp;fine coach and works very structured, which triggers the students to be passioned. Soerin is easily accessible and responsive to questions and / or ambiguities. Soerin is\u0026nbsp;certainly willing to help the students when problems occur. Soerin has a lot of knowledge, not only in the content but also in the structure and design of the study. He may also communicate this knowledge in a proper way, so that things are understandable for others. Soerin reviewed the thesis very detailed, by making comments in Word. The review notes will be clear and transparent. Soerin is very keen on the support of your written pieces with appropriate citations. He also helps to make your writing style \u0027journal proof\u0027. He gives examples (references to pieces from other papers) and make suggestions to improve your writing style. Soerin motivates others to \u201Cget the best out of yourself\u201D. Upon reviewing my thesis also noticed me that Soerin always reviewed with the why question. With this, he triggers another to think even more about the background of the texts are written. I\u2019am very positive about the contact times I had with Soerin, he shares his information with great passion, he is patient and takes his time to help you with questions or ambiguities. I don\u2019t have any improvement points for Soerin as thesis advisor.

While this thesis was outside his field, he provided me valuable feedback on the most crucial parts of my thesis, which were the main relevance between the\u0026nbsp;research question and subquestions, applied thesis methodology and theoretical structure in order to achieve consistency between title, problem, purpose and research questions. I\u2019ve also asked him to review my Final Conclusion \u0026amp; Recommendations. While his profession is in accountancy, his tips and key notes were very helpful and motivated me to finetune my thesis in some certain aspects such as re-production of my research findings and used theoretical literature. I think it is a real added value to let your thesis review by a professional teacher, who reviews dozens of master thesis a week. At the end I would really recommend anyone to let it reviewed by Soerin, which will motivate you to take the extra mile to finish your thesis on time\u003C/em\u003E\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJessica\u003Cbr\u003EMaster in Law\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#4\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022\u003Cem\u003EI hereby would like to recommend Soerin\u0026nbsp;as thesis supervisor / mentor in writing.\n\n Not for your ego but as a huge benefit for future students.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThe reason why I would recommend him is because I believe he sees\u0026nbsp;himself failing when a student fails.

Multiple programs to analyse but also multiple ways to analyse. To connect the dots for a student in times they need it the most is a comfortable action. For example: In my experience I was stuck in an analysis and he\u0026nbsp;did not tell me the answer, but showed me a door which made me think of how to deal with a hurdle.\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EImprovement can be accomplished on the areas of stopping a student when a student is only focussed on deadlines and less on quality of previous handed in parts of the thesis.
