Here, you will learn how to deploy fully scalable React web apps on some of the most powerful cloud computing platforms available, including AWS and Linode. The course starts with exploring the foundations of cloud computing where we dive into a comprehensive overview of the three main cloud service models. This includes: Infrastructure as a Service, Platform as a Service, and Software as a Service. From there we offer an in-depth guide to deploying and configuring virtual instances and the foundations of remote server administration and server security using SSH. Students are then introduced to Linux, where we explore various Linux distributions, the Linux filesystem, and essential Linux maintenance and directory commands. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOnce students have a handle on working with Linux, we\u2019ll dive into the foundations of Web Servers. Here, we\u2019ll explore two industry leaders in the server software space including Apache and NGINX. Students will learn the benefits and use cases of each server technology, combined with an in-depth technical analysis of their performance in production environments. From there we\u2019ll explore database management systems, including both SQL and NoSQL databases, coupled with database transaction standards. In this section students gain valuable insights into a variety of different database options available, and the best use case for each depending on the project type and complexity. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWith a firm handle on the theoretical aspects of web servers and DBMSes, we jump into a practical guide to setting up LAMP stack on Ubuntu through terminal for MacOS and PuTTY for Windows. Here we configure Linux with Apache, MariaDB, and PHP. Students will also learn how to upload data to a MariaDB database, and fetch records from within PHP scripts. The course then takes a theoretical and practical deep dive into server security. Here, we explore both network and hosted firewalls. We emphasize the pitfalls of lax server configurations, and provide a step-by-step guide to enabling and setting up UFW for Ubuntu. Students will also learn how to configure custom ports for SSH tunneling as an added layer of security.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe second half of the course provides a comprehensive guide to Amazon Web Services. We start with demonstrating how to setup, secure, and navigate an AWS account. This includes setting up billing alerts and multi-factor authentication. From there, we take a deep dive into AWS Identity and Access management for enhanced account security, and the management of user accounts for various AWS services. Here we explore IAM User management and permissions, IAM Groups, IAM Policies, and access key rotation. Following the IAM section, we\u2019ll jump into the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) service. In this module students lean to deploy virtual instances on AWS using Amazon Machine Images, Elastic IPs, and Launch Templates. We will also explore IAM roles for EC2, EC2 Security Groups, SSH key pair authentication, and remote administration using both terminal and EC2 Instance connect. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAfter students have a mastery of cloud computing, the next segment explores the development and deployment of interactive web apps using both JavaScript and React. Here we start with JavaScript foundations including the document object model, and DOM manipulation. From there, we hop into JavaScript variables, arithmetic operations, data types, objects, arrays, loops, functions, and events. The JavaScript section concludes with two hands-on projects where students build a background color changer, and photo gallery. After completion of the JavaScript section, students will use their new found skills to build out dynamic front-end UI components using the React JS library. Through a series of hands-on projects, students will build a calculator, Connect-4 Game clone, and a fully customizable e-commerce site. The react modules start from the basics and work up to several intermediate level concepts. This includes: working with code pen, JSX, Functional components, Props, Callbacks, Events, the React State hook, conditional rendering, Fetch API, Refactoring, and much more. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAs you can see this course covers a tremendous bit of ground. Best of all it\u2019s co-authored by Tim Maclachlan - a renowned senior full-stack developer with over 20 years of commercial development experience. As a multi-faceted developer, Tim specializes in algorithmic, analytical and mobile development.

With this course you have the opportunity to relive this fond childhood memory by building a connect-4 clone using React. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EReact, also known as React JS, is a powerful JavaScript library used for building custom, interactive user interfaces using UI components. Some of the most well known examples of organizations using React for their front-end include Netflix, Facebook, and Airbnb. Developed and maintained by Meta along with a community of independent developers, React remains free and open-source. React is a component based library built entirely on JavaScript, which makes it perfect for designing complex UI\u2019s. With React, developers can build encapsulated components that efficiently manage their own state and render UI updates specifically when data changes. For example, think of the automated content refresh feature you see on a twitter feed, or Facebook like button. Here the state of the UI component changes on the page, without having to manually refresh when the data is updated. This is just one small, yet powerful feature of React.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThrough a complete hands-on project, this course will teach you all the fundamental principles of React that you must know to become a proficient React developer. We start with the tools needed to get started with React, along with instructions on creating the Connect-4 game board. From there we dive in to React OnClick Events, Passing Props, Destructing, React Children, and Passing Arguments. With a solid understanding of the foundations, students move on to various styling techniques for the game components, along with Dynamic classes, and handling callbacks. Here we\u2019ll explore inline, global, and dynamic styling coupled with dynamic classes. We will then move on to the React State Hook, React Key Property and initializing the game modules. Students then tackle more intermediate concepts including the logical components of calculating a winner, determining a draw, and React Lifecycle events. In the last module, we explore the implementation of AI for automated move suggestions, and single player games.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn addition to the hands-on React module, we also offer a comprehensive overview of JavaScript for those who need a refresher. Here we start with introducing students to the document object model (DOM) which defines the logical structure of HTML documents. From there we dive into JavaScript to demonstrate various methods in which DOM elements can be manipulated to add interactivity to static components. We start right from the basics, which includes JavaScript placement, and data output. From there we move on to variable declaration, arithmetic operations, operator precedence, data types, and objects. Once the foundations are covered, we move on to more complex operations using Arrays, Conditional Statements, JavaScript comparison operators, Booleans and loops.

Includes JSX, Callbacks, Events, \u002B More","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EThis course takes you step-by-step through the process of building a fully functional calculator in React. React, also known as React JS, is a powerful JavaScript library used for building custom, interactive user interfaces using UI components. Some of the most well known examples of organizations using React for their front-end include Netflix, Facebook, and Airbnb. Developed and maintained by Meta along with a community of independent developers, React remains free and open-source. React is a component based library built entirely on JavaScript, which makes it perfect for designing complex UI\u2019s. With React, developers can build encapsulated components that efficiently manage their own state and render UI updates specifically when data changes. For example, think of the automated content refresh feature you see on a twitter feed, or facebook like button. Here the state of the UI component changes on the page, without having to manually refresh when the data is updated. This is just one small, yet powerful feature of React.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThrough a complete hands-on project, this course will teach you all the fundamental principles of React that you must know to become a proficient React developer. We start right from the basics, including the tools needed to get started. From there we dive into JSX, functional components, props, callbacks, and various OnClick events. By this stage, the calculator will have a complete visual display, coupled with functional arithmetic operations. Students then move on to passing parameters in Callback functions, using the React State Hook, and debugging.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn addition to the hands-on React module, we also offer a comprehensive overview of JavaScript for those who need a refresher. Here we start with introducing students to the document object model (DOM) which defines the logical structure of HTML documents. From there we dive into JavaScript to demonstrate various methods in which DOM elements can be manipulated to add interactivity to static components. We start right from the basics, which includes JavaScript placement, and data output. From there we move on to variable declaration, arithmetic operations, operator precedence, data types, and objects. Once the foundations are covered, we move on to more complex operations using Arrays, Conditional Statements, JavaScript comparison operators, booleans and loops. Here students will learn to unleash the true power of JavaScript to render different outcomes based on user interaction. We will explore the use of functions to efficiently handle repetitive tasks and JavaScript events to handle output based on actions and occurrences. The section will conclude with a hands-on project where students will implement their knowledge to build a web based photo gallery and background color changer. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAs you can see this course covers a tremendous bit of ground. Best of all it features Tim Maclachlan - a renowned senior full-stack developer with over 20 years of commercial development experience. As a multi-faceted developer, Tim specializes in algorithmic, analytical and mobile development. To date, he\u2019s written hundreds of applications and worked in a number of industries from commercial aviation and military, to banking and finance.

In this course you will learn how to develop stylish, mobile responsive web pages right from scratch using some of the most powerful front-end mark-up languages and JavaScript libraries. The course starts with an in-depth overview of HTML where we start by exploring the structure of an HTML web page. Once you\u2019re comfortable with HTML foundations, we move on to demonstrating how to work with a number of HTML elements. This includes: Inline text elements, ordered and unordered lists, embedding media, link creation, tables, background images, form elements and iframes. The HTML segment concludes with a hands-on project that will guide you through creating a complete web page with headers, footers, callouts, images, links, forms and tabular data. By the end of the HTML segment, you\u2019ll be able to proficiently code simple and complex html pages with ease.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe second section of this course focuses exclusively on CSS to bring your web pages to life with custom style sheets. Here, students will learn the importance of responsive design and cross browser compatibility by embedding CSS style rules for individual page components. We start by exploring the parts, and types of CSS rules followed by an introduction into CSS Id\u2019s and divisions. From there we move on to CSS margins, text properties, borders, transparency and text on top of images. Once you have a handle on the foundations we move on to more intricate CSS concepts including CSS positioning, CSS float properties, Link Styling, and z-indexes. Similar to the HTML section, the CSS segment concludes with a comprehensive hands-on guide to building a responsive web page, complete with CSS style definitions, element containers, navigation, and a number of other CSS page elements.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOnce you have a foundational understanding of HTML and CSS, we will dive into working with React, a powerful JavaScript library used for front-end UI development. The React section starts off with a hands-on project where you\u2019ll learn how to work with functional React components, props, Callback functions, OnClick Events, and the React State hook to build a fully functional calculator. From there we will dive into project number two, where you will build a connect-4 clone. Here we will cover more intermediate concepts including passing props, destructuring, passing arguments to click events, various styling methods, and handling callbacks. You will also learn about the React key property, React lifecycle events, and conditional rendering. By the end you will have built a complete multi and single player connect-4 game board with built-in AI capabilities.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn the final section of the course we further unleash the power of React by building out a complete e-commerce site with multiple product categories, a product showcase, shopping cart feature, and much more. Here, we introduce a number of integral new concepts including: JSON server, Fetch API, and installing React router. These essential building blocks will be used to render the product categories, style the product list, and configure the product details page. From there we dive into styled components, refactoring the shop layout, and exploring the concept of \u201Ccontext\u201D in React. In the final stages of the project students will configure the shopping cart basket, and the checkout feature. We will also implement a product search feature, followed by in-depth exercises on validating input forms in React.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAs you can see this course covers a tremendous bit of ground.

In this course you will learn how to use JavaScript along with two powerful JavaScript libraries to build dynamic, interactive web pages. We start with introducing students to the document object model (DOM) which defines the logical structure of HTML documents. From there we dive into JavaScript to demonstrate various methods in which DOM elements can be manipulated to add interactivity to static components. The JavaScript section starts right from the basics, which includes JavaScript placement, and data output. From there we move on to variable declaration, arithmetic operations, operator precedence, data types, and objects. Once the foundations are covered, we move on to more complex operations using Arrays, Conditional Statements, JavaScript comparison operators, booleans and loops. Here students will learn to unleash the true power of JavaScript to render different outcomes based on user interaction. We will explore the use of functions to efficiently handle repetitive tasks and JavaScript events to handle output based on actions and occurrences. The section will conclude with a hands-on project where students will implement their knowledge to build a web based photo gallery and background color changer.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn the second section of this course, students will learn to work with jQuery - a powerful JavaScript library designed to simplify HTML DOM tree traversal and manipulation. jQuery is ultra lightweight, feature rich, and cross-platform compatible. It\u2019s one of the easiest libraries to work with for building out JavaScript features on an HTML web page. jQuery is excellent for event handling, CSS animations, and Ajax integration for asynchronous UI state changes. Similar to the JavaScript section, the jQuery module begins with the foundations. This includes instructions on embedding jQuery to a web page, and an intro into jQuery syntax. Students will learn to work with jQuery selectors, events, and toggling. From there we dive into animations using fades, slides, and the jQuery animate function. Students also learn about chaining, draggable objects, callback functions, the get content method, toggling classes, and filtering. By the end of the jQuery module, you will know how to build stunning animated web pages with ease.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn the last section of this course we\u2019ll explore React - a cutting edge JavaScript library for building state-of-the art user interface components. You\u2019ve likely seen React in action on some of the hottest web apps developed by fortune 500 companies. For example, Netflix, Facebook, and AirBnB all use React for their front-end UI. As a matter of fact, React was developed by Meta alongside a community of independent developers. Until this day, React remains free and open-source so it has plenty of support and documentation. Unlike jQuery which interacts with the document object model directly, React works through a \u201Cvirtual\u201D DOM. React is unaware of changes made to the DOM outside of React and determines updates based on its own internal representations. React is best for creating reusable code blocks for UI components and layering them on top of each other to minimize the number of times the DOM needs to be re-rendering on state changes. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe React section of this course starts off with a hands-on project where you\u2019ll learn how to work with functional React components, props, Callback functions, OnClick Events, and the React State hook to build a fully functional calculator. From there we will dive into project number two, where you will build a connect-4 clone. Here we will cover more intermediate concepts including passing props, destructuring, passing arguments to click events, various styling methods, and handling callbacks. You will also learn about the React key property, React lifecycle events, and conditional rendering. By the end you will have built a complete multi and single player connect-4 game board with built-in AI capabilities. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn the final section of the course we further unleash the power of React by building out a complete e-commerce site with multiple product categories, a product showcase, shopping cart feature, and much more. Here, we introduce a number of integral new concepts including: JSON server, Fetch API, and installing React router. These essential building blocks will be used to render the product categories, style the product list, and configure the product details page. From there we dive into styled components, refactoring the shop layout, and exploring the concept of \u201Ccontext\u201D in React. In the final stages of the project students will configure the shopping cart basket, and the checkout feature. We will also implement a product search feature, followed by in-depth exercises on validating input forms in React.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAs you can see this course covers a tremendous bit of ground. Best of all it\u2019s co-authored by Tim Maclachlan - a renowned senior full-stack developer with over 20 years of commercial development experience.
