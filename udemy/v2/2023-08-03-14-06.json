What used to be distinct areas of the department have been rolled up under one umbrella. The talent management team is responsible for recruiting, hiring, developing, and retaining employees.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERecruiters are the heavy lifters in building any company\u2019s workforce. They\u2019re responsible for the total hiring process including posting positions on job boards, sourcing candidates through job fairs and social media, serving as the first-line contacts for running background checks to screen candidates, conducting the initial interviews, and coordinating with the hiring manager responsible for making the final selection. A recruiter\u2019s success is determined by several key metrics: the number of positions they fill each year, where candidates are coming from (e.g., job postings, social media, career fairs, etc.), the time it takes to fill positions, and reasons why an applicant wasn\u2019t hired. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEmployee relations or support is the area of the talent management team that is concerned with strengthening the employer-employee relationship. Human resources managers in this role study job satisfaction, employee engagement, organizational culture, and resolving workplace conflict. Gallup estimates that disengaged employees cost U.S. businesses a whopping $600\u002B billion each year in lost productivity, so this role is integral to the success of your business.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the company has a unionized workforce, this team will also work on labor relations, including negotiating collective bargaining agreements, creating managerial responses to union organizing campaigns, and interpreting labor union contract questions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe talent management group is also home to HR practitioners who focus on workforce planning and management. This area includes succession planning and retention efforts across the business, from the C-suite on down. When an employee resigns, retires, is fired or laid off, gets sick, or dies, the workforce planning team kicks into action.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.\tCompensation and Benefits\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn smaller companies the compensation and benefits roles can often be overseen by one or two human resources professionals, but companies with a larger workforce will typically split up the duties. HR functions in compensation include evaluating the pay practices of competitors and establishing the compensation structure. The compensation department is also responsible for creating job descriptions in tandem with department managers, as well as working with talent management on succession planning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the benefits side, HR practitioners are typically responsible for functions such as negotiating group health coverage rates with insurance carriers or coordinating with the company\u2019s 401(k) administrator. Of course, payroll is also part of the compensation and benefits area of HR, but many companies choose to outsource this function to a bookkeeper or payroll service provider. Those that don\u2019t generally put payroll practitioners in a separate team that works on the tactical process of generating payroll, with the compensation team focusing mainly on planning and strategy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.\tTraining and Development\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEvery company wants to see its employees thrive, which means providing them with all the tools they need to succeed. These tools aren\u2019t necessarily physical such as laptops, job-related software, or tools for a particular trade; they can include new employee orientation, leadership training programs, personal and professional development, and managerial training. Training and development (sometimes called learning and development) is an integral part of the HR team. Depending on the type of employee role played at the company, the training team might be responsible for building out instructional programs that have a direct effect on the success of the business. Today, many colleges and universities offer degrees in training and development; an instructional design degree would also be helpful in this role.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.\tHR Compliance\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELegal and regulatory compliance is a critical component of any HR department. Employment and labor laws are highly complex, and having a team devoted to monitoring this ever-changing landscape is essential to keeping companies out of trouble with federal, state, and local governments\u2019 laws. When a business is out of compliance, it can result in applicants or employees filing claims based on discriminatory hiring and employment practices or hazardous working conditions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe HR compliance team is also heavily involved\u2014working in tandem with other HR practitioners\u2014in developing all company policy that makes up the employee handbook. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5.\tWorkplace Safety\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA large focus area for HR is developing and supporting safety training and maintaining federally mandated logs in the event injuries or fatalities happen at work.

The delivery of a service for a cost is also considered a sale.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a real art to selling, as any salesperson probably knows. You walk a fine line between alienating the customer and making them feel comfortable. Sales is not something you can pick up right away; it takes time and practice to perfect the art of closing a deal. Developing a solid and proven technique is a big part of learning how to sell efficiently. Here are five selling techniques every salesperson should master.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAccording to Active Listening, One of the reasons that prospective clients are so wary of salespeople is because they anticipate a pushy demeanor and pressure to purchase a client. Setting out with a clear agenda and not interacting with the client beyond a fixed aim is a mistake; it won\u2019t win you sales and it definitely won\u2019t win you fans. More effective selling techniques involve active listening\u2014 allowing for a dialogue with the customer that isn\u2019t just a one-sided conversation. Listening to their concerns, questions, and hesitations will help you respond to them better, and will help the prospective client trust you more as well. People who trust you are much more likely to make a purchase with you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAccording to Warm Calls, Relying on cold calls is an ineffective sales technique; they irritate potential clients and are often screened anyway. Shifting to a warm calling is a much better\u2014and more efficient\u2014way of handling selling. Warm calls involve calling prospective clients who have been chosen for their potential to be receptive to your sales pitch. This includes \u201Cwarming up\u201D leads through things like social media outreach and prior research of the client. Warm calling leads to much higher success rates, since it does away with the scatter shot approach to selling, which is often just a waste of your time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFeatures \u0026amp; Benefits: This one may seem obvious, but it\u2019s not always efficiently carried out by the salesperson. While it\u2019s important to go over the practical functions of a product or service, simply describing the service or product and its various functions isn\u2019t enough to convince someone to make a purchase. The prospective client doesn\u2019t just need to know how it works, they need to understand why they should care. Emphasizing the features and benefits of the product, and the ways it can prove valuable to the potential client, is a classic and effective selling technique that is continually reiterated because it works. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENeeds \u0026amp; Solutions : People like practical reasons why they should invest in a product or service, and they\u2019re more likely to listen to a sales pitch if it offers an effective solution. This sales technique works best with the technique of active listening; it\u2019s important to listen to the client to get a sense of how the product could benefit them, and then tailor your pitch to that individual or company. The sense that the sales pitch has been personalized will make feel the client more comfortable trusting and listening to the salesperson, because they feel like they\u2019re learning about a solution that will work for them, not just you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAccording to Social Selling, Huge pools of potential clients are easily accessible through online social networking, and when you discourage the use of social media as a selling technique, you limit the scope of your salespeople and are potentially standing in the way of future sales. Social media and online connectivity are huge parts of modern communication, and it\u2019s important to adapt to this way of doing business. Actively encourage salespeople to reach out to potential clients and foster leads through social media sites like LinkedIn and Twitter; you\u2019re sales numbers will thank you. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this master course you will learn 5 major topics,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

It varies from person to person, but let\u0027s just say you probably won\u0027t master these in your first few months.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdvanced SEO typically involves technical concepts that are somewhat advanced, and/or a deeper understanding of the workings of Google\u0027s algorithm and are often employed by Professional SEOs. Anyone can master advanced concepts with the right strategic guidance and real life application.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAccording to Griffin, Search engine optimization is the science of improving a website to increase its visibility when people search for products or services. The more visibility a website has on search engines, the more likely it is that brand captures business.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWebsite visibility is commonly measured by the placement -- or ranking -- of the site on search engine results pages (SERPs). And companies always vie for the first page, where they are most likely to garner the most attention.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing Google as an example, SERPs often feature ads at the top of the page. These are positions that businesses are willing to pay for to ensure placement on that first page. Following ads are the regular search listings, which marketers and search engines refer to as organic search results. The SEO process aims to increase a business\u0027s organic search results, driving organic search traffic to the site. This enables data marketers to distinguish between traffic that comes to a website from other channels -- such as paid search, social media, referrals and direct -- and the organic search traffic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrganic search traffic is usually higher-quality traffic because users are actively searching for a specific topic, product or service for which a site might rank. If a user finds that site through the search engine, it can lead to better brand engagement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow does SEO work? While there is a way to maximize results, it is almost impossible to fully manipulate search algorithms. Businesses often look to the shortest path toward ideal results with the least amount of effort, but SEO requires a lot of action and time. There is no SEO strategy where something can be changed today with the expectation of clear results tomorrow. SEO is a long-term project, with daily action and constant activity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch engines use bots to crawl all website pages, downloading and storing that information into a collection known as an index. This index is like a library and when someone searches for something in it, the search engine acts as the librarian. The search engine pulls and displays relevant information from the search query and shows users content related to what they were looking for. Search engine algorithms analyze webpages in the index to determine the order those pages should be displayed on the SERP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe learning objectives of SEO (Search Engine Optimization) encompass various skills and knowledge that enable individuals to effectively optimize websites and content for search engines.

It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables.

It is the practical application of what you have learnt in the first course. If you think that packing and anti-debugging is good enough to prevent reverse engineering, then you may be in for a surprise. In this course, I\u0026nbsp;will show you how to test the effectiveness of several popular packers by packing crackmes and then reversing them - \u003Cstrong\u003Ewithout unpacking. \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETraditionally packed programs are unpacked before debugging is carried out. This is because a packed program\u0027s file cannot be patched. Much of software protection has centered on making it difficult to unpack programs. However,\u0026nbsp; the important question is: how effective is packing, obfuscation and anti-debugging as a means to prevent reversing? This course explores several packers to find the answers. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe will do the analysis using a tool called Cheat Engine, which is a prominent tool used by game hackers. This tool could also be used to study and analyze packed program\u0027s processes that is running in memory. You will learn how to perform debugging in spite of anti-debugging being implemented.
