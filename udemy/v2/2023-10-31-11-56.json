But you will only learn to play it well till you keep on practicing. Course is comprehensive \u0026amp; short, but the key to learn is practicing, practiding \u0026amp; practicing. No other way. No overnight learning. No short cuts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave you ever dreamed of playing the vocals of your favorite song on electric keyboared? If\u0026nbsp; yes, this course is for you. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this course, with the help of any app like organ 2024, which is free to use or any other, your mobile phone will be converted into a real touch electric keyboared. And you will see white and black notes as you see in a piano. I have deigned this course in such a way that most of the lectures in this course are interactive video lectures where I have recorded my mobile screen. So you will see on your mobile, laptop, desktop etc the full screen of my mobile phone and you will listen my voice while learning, \u0026amp; you\u0026nbsp; will also listen the voice of the keyboard when I will touch any key on my touch mobile. You will also see the touched key pressed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can learn by 2 methods, one that if you have a desktop or laptop, you start my course there and you should playing what I am teaching you on your mobile.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other method is that you open my course on your mobile browser on desktop version and start it. Before that, it\u0027s better to open the organ app of keyboared which you will download from android play store or apple store. So after listening my course \u0026amp; understanding, mimize the browser after pausing the video tutorial and open the app and start practicing what you have seen. After that, you will again go to browser to start the course from where you left. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst method has the advantage that while you watch, you can play on your mobile phone. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second method has the advantage that you can learn on the go where ever you are. So it\u0027s your choice. You may use the combinition of both. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe will learn how to move fingers on white \u0026amp; black notes from scratch. Even, a person who has never touch keyboard can learn with course. We will be learning the names of these notes in English. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegarding the course after learning the basic notes \u0026amp; Music terminologies we will practice these notes with a couple of songs. Hopefully, by then, you will yourself be in the position to create the melody of any song you want or ever wished to play in thev voice like Flute, violin, guitar etc, and imagine, if you can play what the singer is singing (vocals) on your keyboard called (Lead) in any of your favorite instrument\u0027s voice, it will really be a\u0026nbsp; dream come true if you are a\u0026nbsp; passionate lover and learner of music. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIsn\u0027t it exciting thing\u0026nbsp; that you not need to buy even a keyboard. But you have various apps and your mobile phone has been virtually converted to a musical keyboard. You may even attach your mobile to speaker to play in a family or friends gathering after you have got the confidence. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven more exciting is that as the sound is produced from mobile, there are no issues of recording. And if you buy a real keyboard or harmonium/Harmonica, you will play it in the same way as you will learn in this course.
