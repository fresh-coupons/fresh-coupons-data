In this course you will learn how to use JavaScript along with two powerful JavaScript libraries to build dynamic, interactive web pages. We start with introducing students to the document object model (DOM) which defines the logical structure of HTML documents. From there we dive into JavaScript to demonstrate various methods in which DOM elements can be manipulated to add interactivity to static components. The JavaScript section starts right from the basics, which includes JavaScript placement, and data output. From there we move on to variable declaration, arithmetic operations, operator precedence, data types, and objects. Once the foundations are covered, we move on to more complex operations using Arrays, Conditional Statements, JavaScript comparison operators, booleans and loops. Here students will learn to unleash the true power of JavaScript to render different outcomes based on user interaction. We will explore the use of functions to efficiently handle repetitive tasks and JavaScript events to handle output based on actions and occurrences. The section will conclude with a hands-on project where students will implement their knowledge to build a web based photo gallery and background color changer.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn the second section of this course, students will learn to work with jQuery - a powerful JavaScript library designed to simplify HTML DOM tree traversal and manipulation. jQuery is ultra lightweight, feature rich, and cross-platform compatible. It\u2019s one of the easiest libraries to work with for building out JavaScript features on an HTML web page. jQuery is excellent for event handling, CSS animations, and Ajax integration for asynchronous UI state changes. Similar to the JavaScript section, the jQuery module begins with the foundations. This includes instructions on embedding jQuery to a web page, and an intro into jQuery syntax. Students will learn to work with jQuery selectors, events, and toggling. From there we dive into animations using fades, slides, and the jQuery animate function. Students also learn about chaining, draggable objects, callback functions, the get content method, toggling classes, and filtering. By the end of the jQuery module, you will know how to build stunning animated web pages with ease.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn the last section of this course we\u2019ll explore React - a cutting edge JavaScript library for building state-of-the art user interface components. You\u2019ve likely seen React in action on some of the hottest web apps developed by fortune 500 companies. For example, Netflix, Facebook, and AirBnB all use React for their front-end UI. As a matter of fact, React was developed by Meta alongside a community of independent developers. Until this day, React remains free and open-source so it has plenty of support and documentation. Unlike jQuery which interacts with the document object model directly, React works through a \u201Cvirtual\u201D DOM. React is unaware of changes made to the DOM outside of React and determines updates based on its own internal representations. React is best for creating reusable code blocks for UI components and layering them on top of each other to minimize the number of times the DOM needs to be re-rendering on state changes. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe React section of this course starts off with a hands-on project where you\u2019ll learn how to work with functional React components, props, Callback functions, OnClick Events, and the React State hook to build a fully functional calculator. From there we will dive into project number two, where you will build a connect-4 clone. Here we will cover more intermediate concepts including passing props, destructuring, passing arguments to click events, various styling methods, and handling callbacks. You will also learn about the React key property, React lifecycle events, and conditional rendering. By the end you will have built a complete multi and single player connect-4 game board with built-in AI capabilities. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn the final section of the course we further unleash the power of React by building out a complete e-commerce site with multiple product categories, a product showcase, shopping cart feature, and much more. Here, we introduce a number of integral new concepts including: JSON server, Fetch API, and installing React router. These essential building blocks will be used to render the product categories, style the product list, and configure the product details page. From there we dive into styled components, refactoring the shop layout, and exploring the concept of \u201Ccontext\u201D in React. In the final stages of the project students will configure the shopping cart basket, and the checkout feature. We will also implement a product search feature, followed by in-depth exercises on validating input forms in React.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAs you can see this course covers a tremendous bit of ground. Best of all it\u2019s co-authored by Tim Maclachlan - a renowned senior full-stack developer with over 20 years of commercial development experience. As a multi-faceted developer, Tim specializes in algorithmic, analytical and mobile development. To date, he\u2019s written hundreds of applications and worked in a number of industries from commercial aviation and military, to banking and finance.

Additionally, we will examine how coaching methods contribute to the mental health and well-being of employees, acting as a vital support system for individuals who may have limited access to other sources of guidance.","The Transformation of Managerial Roles  1.1 Evolving Leadership Expectations  The traditional image of a manager as a stern authority figure has given way to a more holistic view of leadership. Managers are now expected to serve as role models, motivators, and mentors to their teams. This shift stems from the recognition that employees perform at their best when they feel valued, supported, and empowered.  The evolution of leadership expectations can be traced back to the changing dynamics of the modern workplace. In the past, managers were primarily responsible for enforcing rules and ensuring productivity. However, as organizations began to realize that employee engagement and satisfaction were crucial for success, a transformation in managerial roles ensued.  Today, managers are not just tasked with overseeing tasks and projects; they are expected to inspire and empower their teams. This shift is partly a response to the changing nature of work itself. In a knowledge-based economy, where creativity, innovation, and adaptability are paramount, traditional top-down management no longer suffices.","1.2 Coaching as a Leadership Skill  Coaching has emerged as a pivotal leadership skill that fosters personal and professional growth. We\u0027ll explore how coaching techniques, such as active listening, constructive feedback, and goal-setting, can empower managers to become effective leaders who inspire and guide their teams towards excellence.  Coaching is not a one-size-fits-all approach; it is a dynamic and personalized method of leadership. Effective coaches adapt their style to the needs and preferences of individual team members. They actively listen to understand the unique challenges and aspirations of each employee, fostering a sense of trust and rapport.  Moreover, coaching is not merely about providing solutions but guiding employees to discover answers themselves. This approach instills a sense of ownership and accountability in team members. It encourages them to take the initiative, think critically, and develop problem-solving skills\u2014a valuable asset in today\u0027s fast-paced, ever-changing business landscape.  Coaching also plays a crucial role in setting and achieving goals. Effective managers use coaching techniques to collaboratively define clear, actionable objectives with their team members. This process not only aligns individual efforts with organizational goals but also empowers employees to track their progress and make necessary adjustments along the way.","Coaching Knowledge for Career Development  2.1 Career Development in the Modern Workplace  In today\u0027s highly competitive job market, career development is a top priority for employees. Discover how coaching knowledge equips managers with the tools to help team members navigate their career paths, set meaningful goals, and continually improve their skills.  Career development has evolved from being a peripheral concern to a central focus in the modern workplace. In an era marked by rapid technological advancements and industry disruptions, employees recognize the importance of continuous learning and skill enhancement to remain relevant and competitive.  This heightened emphasis on career development places managers at the forefront of helping their team members chart their professional journeys. Coaching knowledge equips managers with the ability to provide guidance that is not only aligned with the organization\u0027s needs but also tailored to the aspirations of individual employees.  One of the key advantages of coaching in career development is its ability to facilitate self-awareness. Effective coaches help employees identify their strengths, weaknesses, interests, and values. Armed with this self-knowledge, employees can make informed career decisions that align with their passions and long-term goals.","2.2 The Manager as a Career Development Partner  Explore the responsibilities of middle and top managers in preparing and mentoring personal development plans for their team members. Learn how these plans can align with organizational objectives and create a win-win situation for both employees and the company.  Managers who actively engage in career development become indispensable partners in their employees\u0027 professional growth. They play a pivotal role in creating personalized development plans that leverage individual strengths and address areas needing improvement.  These development plans not only benefit the employees but also the organization. By aligning individual development goals with the company\u0027s strategic objectives, managers ensure that every team member\u0027s growth contributes to the overall success of the business.  Furthermore, coaching techniques are instrumental in fostering a growth mindset within teams. Managers can use coaching to encourage employees to embrace challenges, persist in the face of setbacks, and view failures as opportunities for learning and improvement. This mindset shift has a profound impact on team performance and innovation.","Coaching for Internal Education and Employee Development  3.1 The Role of Managers in Internal Education  Managers often bear the responsibility of nurturing a culture of learning within their teams and organizations. Explore how coaching methods can be instrumental in identifying and addressing skill gaps, fostering innovation, and supporting ongoing employee development.  In the rapidly evolving landscape of business, organizations that prioritize learning and development gain a competitive edge. Managers are at the forefront of this initiative, serving as the catalysts for continuous improvement and innovation within their teams.  Coaching methods play a pivotal role in identifying and addressing skill gaps. By regularly assessing the competencies of their team members, managers can tailor training and development programs to bridge these gaps effectively. This proactive approach not only enhances individual skills but also bolsters the organization\u0027s overall capabilities.","Moreover, coaching encourages a culture of innovation. Effective coaches inspire creativity and critical thinking in their teams. They challenge employees to question the status quo, explore new ideas, and experiment with novel approaches. In this way, managers act as innovation champions, driving progress and adaptability.","3.2 Coaching as a Tool for Employee Empowerment  Employee empowerment is a cornerstone of effective leadership. Coaching techniques provide managers with the tools to empower their team members by fostering a sense of ownership and autonomy in their roles.  One of the primary ways coaching empowers employees is by promoting self-directed learning. Instead of relying solely on formal training programs, employees learn to identify their development needs and take initiative in seeking resources and opportunities for growth. Managers who coach effectively encourage this proactive approach.  Furthermore, coaching cultivates a growth-oriented mindset among employees. When team members receive regular feedback, both positive and constructive, they become more receptive to continuous improvement. They view challenges as opportunities for growth and development, which ultimately leads to higher levels of engagement and performance.  By creating an environment where continuous learning is celebrated, managers inspire their teams to thrive in an ever-changing business landscape. This culture of learning becomes a strategic advantage for organizations, as it enables them to adapt quickly to new challenges and opportunities.","Coaching for Mental Health and Well-being  4.1 The Manager as a Trusted Support System  For many employees, especially those who live alone or lack a strong support network, a manager can become their most trusted confidant. Understand how coaching methods extend beyond professional development to support the mental health and well-being of team members.  The relationship between a manager and their team members extends beyond the confines of the workplace. In some cases, a manager may be the primary source of support for an employee, especially when they are facing personal challenges or seeking guidance related to their mental health and well-being.  Coaching methods are not limited to career development; they encompass the whole spectrum of an employee\u0027s life. Effective managers create an environment where team members feel comfortable discussing personal challenges and seeking guidance when needed. This trust and openness are essential for maintaining employee well-being.  In situations where employees are dealing with stress, anxiety, or other mental health issues, managers with coaching skills can provide valuable support. They can listen empathetically, offer guidance on stress management techniques, and help employees access appropriate resources for professional help when necessary.","4.2 Coaching for Life Questions and Personal Challenges  Life is filled with complexities, and employees often grapple with personal challenges that can affect their work performance and overall well-being. Managers who are skilled in coaching can offer valuable guidance during these times of need.  One area where coaching is particularly beneficial is work-life balance. In today\u0027s fast-paced world, employees often struggle to juggle their professional and personal responsibilities. Managers can use coaching techniques to help team members set boundaries, manage their time effectively, and achieve a healthier work-life balance.  Coaching also proves invaluable in navigating interpersonal relationships, both within and outside the workplace. Managers can offer insights into effective communication, conflict resolution, and building positive relationships, which can significantly impact an employee\u0027s overall quality of life.  In times of personal crisis or uncertainty, such as major life transitions or unexpected challenges, employees may turn to their managers for guidance. Managers trained in coaching can provide a supportive and non-judgmental space for employees to explore their feelings, identify potential solutions, and develop action plans to address these challenges.","In conclusion, coaching techniques have become indispensable in the modern workplace, particularly within the roles of managers and leaders. These skills not only drive career development and internal education but also play a crucial role in supporting the mental health and well-being of employees.  As we navigate an ever-changing professional landscape, organizations that recognize the importance of coaching will not only foster a culture of continuous improvement but also cultivate a loyal and motivated workforce. Managers who embrace coaching as a core aspect of their leadership style will not only elevate their own careers but also become catalysts for the success of their teams and organizations as a whole.  By understanding and implementing coaching techniques effectively, managers can truly transform the workplace into an environment where individuals thrive, careers flourish, and holistic well-being is nurtured."],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":248,"averageValue":"4.3"},"instructors":[{"name":"MTF Institute of Management, Technology and Finance","url":"/user/mtfinstitute/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.482143}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"3C39C91F18B4EE3CF3BC","originalPrice":"\u20B91,499","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/easy-way-to-learn-python-for-beginners-2021/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":3812128,"title":"Complete PYTHON Programming for Beginners - 2024","shortDescription":"The easiest way to learn Python in-depth and build complex, scalable programs!","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EOn successful completion of the course, you will be able to program in the professional object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm in Python, which allows you to start your programmer career.

This course covers an extensive amount of material and by the end you will be proficient enough with AWS to gain an entry level position in cloud administration.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe curriculum starts off with exploring AWS account registration, billing and multi-factor authentication. We then explore more advanced account security through AWS identity and access management (IAM). IAM is an integral part of AWS that facilitates the management of users, groups, and security policies that control AWS resources. Here, we explore the creation of IAM users with varying degrees of account access. This includes user groups, permission policies, and IAM roles for EC2.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOnce students have a firm understanding of IAM, we dive into the backbone of AWS by exploring EC2 instance deployment and configuration. EC2 is a core service of AWS that facilitates the launch of virtual servers (called instances) within the AWS cloud console. We cover how to launch and configure EC2 instances, including choosing the right instance type and setting up security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic. We also explore remote instance administration using PuTTY and Terminal to issue server commands and manage instances from any remote location. Students learn to deploy and assign elastic IP addresses along with the creation of Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) to save instance state and quickly launch new instances with replicated configurations.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAfter completion of the EC2 module, we jump into AWS storage solutions where we explore various storage types including, block, file and object storage. More specifically students learn to harness the power of the Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) and the Amazon Elastic File System (EFS). We demonstrate how to deploy and configure multiple EBS volumes and attach them to existing instances for maximum scalability. Students also learn to design and deploy seamlessly scalable storage systems using EFS. We demonstrate how to mount multiple instances to a single EFS endpoint for centralized access to data files. We complete the module by showcasing the power of EBS snapshots and Amazon Machine Images for efficient instance deployment and backups.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EFrom this point, the course branches into more intermediate concepts by exploring elastic load balancing (ELB), Auto Scaling Groups (ASG), and Route 53. Student will learn to deploy a highly available architecture that auto scales based on real-time traffic workload and instance health checks. Traffic will be routed directly through Amazons Route 53 DNS service, with customized domain names and pre-configured hosted zones.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EBy the end of this course, you will have a solid understanding of how to use AWS to build and deploy your own cloud-based infrastructure. You will be able to launch and configure EC2 instances, store and manage data in the cloud, and use services like ELB and ASG to scale your infrastructure to meet the needs of your applications.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIf you\u0027re excited about expanding your knowledge in AWS and the field of cloud computing, hit the enroll button and let\u0027s get started.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-beginner-to-intermediate-ec2-iam-elb-asg-route-53/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5029488_f4fc_5.jpg","duration":"9.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"32,485.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Students interested in Cloud Computing with AWS","Students interested in learning the foundations of Amazon Web Services","Students interested in administering AWS accounts using Identity and Access Management (IAM)","Students interested in securing AWS accounts by assigning Access Privileges to IAM Users","Students interested in deploying Virtual Servers on AWS","Cloud Computing Enthusiasts looking to gain knowledge on using AWS","Students interested in learning about the Amazon EC2 Service","Students interested in learning various AWS Storage Solutions for EC2 (EBS, EFS)","Students interested in learning Dynamic Scaling, Elastic Load Balancing, and Auto Scaling Groups","Students interested in Managing Domain hosted zones using Amazon Route 53"],"tags":["Cloud Computing","Amazon EC2"],"rating":{"count":190,"averageValue":"4.5"},"instructors":[{"name":"YouAccel Training","url":"/user/youaccel/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.5208335}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"YOUACCEL98618","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"2 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/directorio-de-plugins-para-wordpress/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5356984,"title":"Directorio de Plugins para WordPress 2024","shortDescription":"Aprende a usar y configurar los mejores plugins para WordPress paso a paso.","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWordPress \u003C/strong\u003Ees un software gratuito o herramienta de gesti\u00F3n de contenidos, tambi\u00E9n llamado CMS (Content Management System), dise\u00F1ada para crear y mantener f\u00E1cilmente un Blog, un sitio Web o una Tienda Online.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWordPress es sin duda alguna, el mejor gestor de contenidos del mundo, y el m\u00E1s utilizado con diferencia, llegando actualmente a superar el 58% de cuota de mercado.\u003C/strong\u003E Adem\u00E1s es de c\u00F3digo abierto y completamente gratuito.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ELos plugins son parte fundamental del funcionamiento en WordPress, ya que nos permiten mejorar las funcionalidades que este famoso CMS trae por defecto.

It emphasizes adaptability and iterative progress.","Scrum: Scrum is an Agile framework for managing and delivering work, often used in software development.

It originated from manufacturing but has applications in various industries.","Six Sigma: Six Sigma is a data-driven methodology for process improvement that aims to reduce defects and variations. It uses the DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control) approach to systematically improve processes.","Kanban: Kanban is a visual project management method that helps teams manage and optimize workflow. It uses visual boards with cards representing work items to limit work in progress and improve the flow of work through the system.","Learning about project management, agile and flexible management approaches (such as Agile, Scrum, and Kanban), and process improvement frameworks (Lean and Six Sigma) is of paramount importance for companies and professionals alike. These concepts play a crucial role in modern business operations and can significantly impact the career growth of managers. Here\u0027s why they are important:  Effective Project Execution: Project management provides the essential skills and techniques to plan, execute, and control projects efficiently. It ensures that projects are completed on time, within budget, and with the desired quality.

By learning and implementing these concepts, companies can streamline their operations, reduce costs, and improve customer satisfaction. Managers who can optimize processes add substantial value to their organizations.","Customer-Centric Approach: Agile and Lean principles stress the importance of focusing on the customer\u0027s needs and delivering value. Companies that adopt these approaches are more likely to build customer loyalty and gain a competitive edge. Managers who understand how to prioritize customer-centricity can drive business growth.","Risk Mitigation: Both project management and agile methodologies emphasize risk management. Understanding how to identify, assess, and mitigate risks is crucial for ensuring project success and minimizing unexpected setbacks. Companies value managers who can navigate potential pitfalls.","Career Advancement: For managers, mastering these concepts can be a significant career booster.
