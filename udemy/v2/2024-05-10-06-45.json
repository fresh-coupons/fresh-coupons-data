Here\u0027s a simple analogy:  Marketing is like cooking a delicious meal. It involves finding the right recipe (products/services), sourcing the best ingredients (market research), and carefully preparing the dish (advertising, promotions).  Marketing Management is like being the head chef. They devise the overall menu (marketing strategy), manage the kitchen staff (marketing teams), ensure the budget is efficient, and keep track of customer feedback (measuring results) to perfect future meals.","Advertising:  Advertising is a form of communication that aims to promote or sell a product, service, or idea.
