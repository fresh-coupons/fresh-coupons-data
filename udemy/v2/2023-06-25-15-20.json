The development by Kary Mullis in 1986of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Especific segments of DNA spawned another revolution.Recombinant DNA technology, PCR, and other molecular\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etechnologies are leading to an ever-increasing number ofexciting discoveries that are furthering our knowledge of\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebasic biological functions and will lead to improvementsin the quality of human life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E In recent years, the sequencing of the genomes ofa large number of viruses and organisms has changed thescope of experiments performed by geneticists.

It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables.

In many ways, the normally tuned immune system continuously plays an orchestrated \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esymphony to maintain homeostasis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe immune system is a \u201Cteam effort,\u003C/strong\u003E\u201D involving many different players. These players can be divided roughly into two groups: those that are members of the innate immune system team and those that are part of the adaptive immune system. Importantly, these two groups work together to provide a powerful defense against invaders. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImmunology is a difficult subject for several reasons. First, there are lots of details, and sometimes these details get in \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe way of understanding the concepts. To get around this problem, we\u2019re going to concentrate on the big picture. It \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewill be easy for you to find the details somewhere else. Another difficulty in learning immunology is that there \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eis an exception to every rule. Immunologists love these exceptions, because they give clues as to how the immune \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esystem functions. But for now, we\u2019re just going to learn the rules. Oh sure, we\u2019ll come upon exceptions from time \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eto time, but we won\u2019t dwell on them. Our goal is to exam-ine the immune system, stripped to its essence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA third difficulty in studying immunology is that our knowledge of the immune system is still evolving. As \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyou\u2019ll see, there are many unanswered questions, and some of the things that seem true today will be proven \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efalse tomorrow. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe term \u201Cimmunology\u003C/strong\u003E\u201D is derived from Latin word \u201Cimmunis\u201D means exempt, i.e., protection from infectious diseases. Extensive work on bacteriology and pathology made their respective workers to find methods to develop resistance against infectious diseases in the latter half of 19th and beginning of 20th century. Although the history of immunology is about 100 years old, cellular immunology dates back to the 1950s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ewhy is immunology so important?\u003C/strong\u003E The immune system has involvement in almost all fields related to health and disease. Infections continue to confront human health and well-being on a global scale. Inflammation contributes to the \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Elung, heart and joint diseases, and diabetes mellitus; cancers have to evade immune surveillance, and immune dysregulation leads to allergies that are increasingly prevalent across the world. Only improved understanding of the \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emechanisms by which microbes, allergens, and tumor cells cause disease will result in the development of diagnostic, therapeutic, and preventative strategies to combat this threat.However, we are only beginning the voyage of immunology, and there is much we still need to research and understand. The study of basic immunology may provide students with an opportunity to relate the findings of fundamental sciscientific investigations to clinical problems\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ehistory\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBabylonian Epic of Gilgamesh (2000 B. C.) records the presence of pestilence and diseases. The study of Immunology stemmed out from the Thucydides\u2019 description of individuals who recovered from the plague in Athens. Those individuals, who had already contracted the disease, recovered and became \u201Cimmune.\u201D Variolation was practiced for many years in China. The process involved exposing healthy people to the material derived from the lesions caused by the disease by either putting it under the skin or, more often, inserting powdered scabs from smallpox pustules into the nose. However, that occasionally resulted in death because there was no standardization of the inoculum. Variolation, later, became popular \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ein England, mainly due to the efforts of Lady Mary Wortley Montague and the American colonies. In 1796, Jenner inoculated James Phipps with the material obtained from a cowpox lesion, which appeared on the hand of a \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edairymaid, and he inoculated the experimental subject with smallpox about six weeks later, without producing disease [1]. In 1875, Robert Koch was able to show the presence of anthrax causing bacteria in the lymph nodes of a dead rabbit that was earlier inoculated with the blood of a diseased animal [2]. In a serendipitous discovery, Pasteur was able to attenuate the virulent chicken cholera bacillus and coined the term vaccination. Later, he developed first viable vaccine for anthrax and rabies while Robert Koch studied hypersensitivity in tuberculosis. Although many consider Louis Pasteur the \u201Cfather of \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eimmunology,\u201D it is due to his and Koch\u2019s efforts that firmly established the historical germ theory of disease. Then, various scientists contributed to the development of the concept of cellular and humoral immunity. While working on the development of digestive organ in starfish larvae, Metchnikoff became a leading proponent of the \u201CCellularists.\u201D He believed that phagocytes, not antibodies, played the leading role in immunity. Emil von Behring and Kitasato demonstrated the transfer of immunity against Diphtheria by a soluble \u201Canti-toxin\u201D in the blood\u0026nbsp; whereby, Paul Ehrlich predicted the existence of immune bodies (antibodies) and side-chains from which they arise (receptors). Ehrlich suggested that antigens interact with receptors borne by cells, resulting in the secretion of excess receptors (antibodies).the supporters of alternative theory, i.e., \u201CHumoralists,\u201D believed that a soluble substance in the body was responsible for mediating immunity \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E OVERVIEW OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPHYSICAL BARRIERS\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eimmunological mechanisms\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETHE INNATE IMMUNE SYSTEM\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETHE ADAPTIVE IMMUNE SYSTEM\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eorgan of immune system\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecells of immune system\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAntigen\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMacrophage\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhat is immune response ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eimmunoglobulin\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eimmunotolerance\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehistocompatibility\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eimmunotherapy\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecytokines\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecomplement system\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegulation of immune response\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eimmunity to infection\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etransplantation immunology\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eautoimmune diseases\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehypersensitivity \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eimmunization\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etumor immunology\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eimmunodiagnostics\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/immunology-step-by-step/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5080764_72e0_2.jpg","duration":"6 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"2,072.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Students who are considering or attending medical school or other health-related professional programs (nursing, pharmacy, PA) \u2013 including those at the high school, undergraduate, and postgraduate levels Professionals looking to improve knowledge for work on health care applications, projects, and research Curious learners with sufficient prerequisites (biology, chemistry, physics) who want to know more"],"tags":["Immunology"],"rating":{"count":2,"averageValue":"4.6"},"instructors":[{"name":"Mohamed AL ashram","url":"/user/mohamed-taha-288/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.75}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"1E6755E4D012F7233C9F","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/english-placement-test/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":3243178,"title":"English placement test","shortDescription":"Welcome in this practice test, just to know your level to improve it.","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EWho wants to know his / her level... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyou have to answer these tests and be okay with them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou have to revise your language before tests.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethese tests only to know your level.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etest your English with your own...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Epractice test, just to know your level to improve it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efocus on your language and your grammer...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eit\u0027s at all your English placement test...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also share the test results with us and get advice.

It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are practicals of:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E* Javascript Course Contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Array\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Variables\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Functions\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Objects\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Control Statements\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Cookies\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Loop statements\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESee you inside the course\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-practicals-crash-course/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4200228_c917_2.jpg","duration":"38 total mins","enrolledStudentsCount":"85,048.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["For Javascript  Programming Beginners","For People New to Javascript","For People Who want to learn Javascript Fundamentals and later Transition into Web Development"],"tags":["JavaScript"],"rating":{"count":869,"averageValue":"4.1"},"instructors":[{"name":"PROPER DOT INSTITUTE","url":"/user/vivek-dahibhate-2/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.0585938}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"74CA32390AC8CB71AE5C","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"\u20B9529","expirationText":"5 hours","discountPercentage":34}}},"freeCourses":{}}
