It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhich all classification techniques are taught in this course?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this course we learn both parametric and non-parametric classification techniques. The primary focus will be on the following three techniques:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELogistic Regression\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELinear Discriminant Analysis\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EK - Nearest Neighbors (KNN) \u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHow much time does it take to learn Classification techniques of machine learning?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClassification is easy but no one can determine the learning time it takes. It totally depends on you. The method we adopted to help you learn classification starts from the basics and takes you to advanced level within hours. You can follow the same, but remember you can learn nothing without practicing it. Practice is the only way to remember whatever you have learnt. Therefore, we have also provided you with another data set to work on as a separate project of classification.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat are the steps I should follow to be able to build a Machine Learning model?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can divide your learning process into 3 parts:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStatistics and Probability - Implementing Machine learning techniques require basic knowledge of Statistics and probability concepts. Second section of the course covers this part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnderstanding of Machine learning - Fourth section helps you understand the terms and concepts associated with Machine learning and gives you the steps to be followed to build a machine learning model\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProgramming Experience - A significant part of machine learning is programming. Python and R clearly stand out to be the leaders in the recent days. Third section will help you set up the Python environment and teach you some basic operations. In later sections there is a video on how to implement each concept taught in theory lecture in Python\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnderstanding of\u0026nbsp; models - Fifth and sixth section cover Classification models and with each theory lecture comes a corresponding practical lecture where we actually run each query with you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy use R for Machine Learning?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnderstanding R is one of the valuable skills needed for a career in Machine Learning. Below are some reasons why you should learn Machine learning in R\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\t1. It\u2019s a popular language for Machine Learning at top tech firms. Almost all of them hire data scientists who use R. Facebook, for example, uses R to do behavioral analysis with user post data. Google uses R to assess ad effectiveness and make economic forecasts. And by the way, it\u2019s not just tech firms: R is in use at analysis and consulting firms, banks and other financial institutions, academic institutions and research labs, and pretty much everywhere else data needs analyzing and visualizing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\t2. Learning the data science basics is arguably easier in R. R has a big advantage: it was designed specifically with data manipulation and analysis in mind. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\t3. Amazing packages that make your life easier. Because R was designed with statistical analysis in mind, it has a fantastic ecosystem of packages and other resources that are great for data science. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\t4. Robust, growing community of data scientists and statisticians. As the field of data science has exploded, R has exploded with it, becoming one of the fastest-growing languages in the world (as measured by StackOverflow). That means it\u2019s easy to find answers to questions and community guidance as you work your way through projects in R.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\t5. Put another tool in your toolkit. No one language is going to be the right tool for every job. Adding R to your repertoire will make some projects easier \u2013 and of course, it\u2019ll also make you a more flexible and marketable employee when you\u2019re looking for jobs in data science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat is the difference between Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPut simply, machine learning and data mining use the same algorithms and techniques as data mining, except the kinds of predictions vary. While data mining discovers previously unknown patterns and knowledge, machine learning reproduces known patterns and knowledge\u2014and further automatically applies that information to data, decision-making, and actions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDeep learning, on the other hand, uses advanced computing power and special types of neural networks and applies them to large amounts of data to learn, understand, and identify complicated patterns. Automatic language translation and medical diagnoses are examples of deep

Simply put I was going out scanning products with my phone on the shop shelves, buying at a discounted price and sending to Amazon and \u201Cflipping a profit\u201D this quickly evolved into a private label product that had turned into a 7 figure business. While this business was thriving, I identified that a lot of cash was being held in stock, the production of stock and stock in the delivery process. I was on the hunt for a new model that would circumvent these headaches! After much research and several courses later, Amazon KDP was on my radar!

The only constructive critique I would give would be concerning the technical form of the presentation, more specifically the video quality and picture aesthetic. Going by the current standard as it applies to video, everything we view is in high definition. Having said that, I believe the video quality could be improved upon as well as the backdrop which I found to be a bit generic and outdated.

Students will explore the process of selecting representative samples from larger populations, a crucial step in making valid statistical inferences. Various sampling methods, such as simple random sampling, stratified sampling, cluster sampling, and systematic sampling, will be covered in detail, enabling students to understand how to collect data that accurately represents a broader group. The importance of sampling in real-world applications will be emphasized, including considerations of bias and sampling error that can impact the validity of conclusions drawn from sample data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA central focus of the course is the Central Limit Theorem, a key statistical concept that underpins much of inferential statistics. Through examples and hands-on exercises, students will learn how the CLT allows statisticians to approximate the distribution of sample means as normal, even when the population distribution is not normal. This property is foundational to many statistical methods, such as hypothesis testing and confidence interval estimation. Understanding the CLT enables students to appreciate the role of sample size, as larger samples yield distributions of sample means that are more consistently normal and provide a closer approximation of population parameters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe course also introduces the concept of standard error, which measures the variability of a sample statistic, such as the sample mean, around the true population parameter. Students will examine how standard error reflects the precision of sample estimates and how it can be minimized through increased sample sizes. Applications of standard error in constructing confidence intervals and performing hypothesis tests will be covered, allowing students to quantify uncertainty and make informed inferences based on sample data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThroughout the course, students will work on practical examples that demonstrate the applications of statistical concepts across various fields, such as social science research, economics, and quality control. These examples will illustrate how sampling, the CLT, and standard error are applied in real-world scenarios to draw conclusions about larger populations from sample data. By the end of the course, students will be equipped with essential statistical tools and techniques, laying the groundwork for more advanced studies in statistics and data analysis.
