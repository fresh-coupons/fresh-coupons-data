By the end of the course, students will have the skills necessary to build a fully customizable e-commerce site on an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance. The entire infrastructure will be highly available and scalable using Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs) and Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs). \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe course begins by introducing students to AWS and the various services it offers. This includes a brief overview of the AWS management console and how to navigate it. From there, we delve deeper into the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) service. EC2 will serve as the backbone of the e-commerce site we build using React.JS. Students will learn how to launch and configure EC2 instances, as well as how to connect to them securely using remote connection utilities like PuTTY and Terminal. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ENext, we will cover AWS Storage, including Elastic Block Store (EBS) and Elastic File System (EFS).

We also explore the different types of storage available on AWS and when to use each one.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAfter covering the basics, students learn to create Elastic Load Balancers and integrate them with Auto Scaling Groups for workload distribution. Here, we demonstrate how to create a highly available and scalable infrastructure for the e-commerce site which will be built in the last section of the course. The infrastructure will automatically scale based on traffic and overall load. Traffic will only be distributed to healthy nodes in the network, based on parameters that are established during configuration. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EFinally, students learn how to build a fully customizable e-commerce site using React.js. Here, students will create and manage a React project, as well as effectively use React components to build a dynamic user interface. We also explore how to integrate the e-commerce site with other AWS services such as AWS storage, to efficiently scale capacity based on application requirements.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThroughout the course, students will work on hands-on projects to apply the concepts they have learned. These projects include building a simple e-commerce site to start and scaling up to a more complex site with advanced features such as product search, and product categories.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EBy the end of the course, students will have a solid understanding of the basics of AWS and React.js.

And after that, we are going to build our first simple yet very interesting project and that\u0027s a payment page with Paypal. The second project will be about a simple forum system. They are going to be also a couple of generic projects like the full CRUD\u0026nbsp;app and so on. After this, the next project will be the starting of something big because it\u0027s an authentication system where I am going to teach you how to develop a login and a register page, how to hash and de-hash passwords, how to do validation and so much more. After this, we are going to build a comments system and this will be the biggest project in this course. We will begin first by doing a post system and then we will grab comments for every post that we have of course we will use Ajax-JQuery for inserting, deleting, and showing comments. after that, we will integrate a rating system into the previous two projects to make a bigger project. So, I will show how to download a JQuery plugin, how to integrate it and how to use it to do the rating system for every post, and so on. And the rating system is going to be implemented of course using Ajax-JQuery. The upcoming project is going to be also created with Ajax and JQuery and that\u0027s a live search system and we will combine it with our big project. There are a lot of projects along the way but it\u0027s going to take a very long time to talk about them. So I will let you discover the many benefits of this course.

It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E*\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E javascript course contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript introduction\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript array\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript variables\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript functions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript objects\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript control statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript cookies\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript loop statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript data structures\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript error handling\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript regular expressions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESection 4- python programming language.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis course section provides an introduction to programming and the python language. students are introduced to core python programming concepts like conditionals, loops, variables, and functions. this section includes an overview of the various python aspects.
