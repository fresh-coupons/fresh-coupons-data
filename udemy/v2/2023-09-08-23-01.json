initial stage, which is theoretical lectures, then moving to the second stage, which is a practical session from a certified lecturer at the College of Computers and Information, which begins with you step by step in building a strong mentality towards the field of programming and gradually building methods for writing code in the C language in an effective way. In the lecture, we explain the basic theoretical details, in addition to having a practical application for them, then proceed with a practical application session that teaches you ways of thinking and how to apply what you have learned in what is called logical thinking, and apply it in code simply on the code editor, with all the explanation files, codes, and files for the session deliverables.

Your don\u2019t have to put up any of your own money to fund businesses. There\u2019s limited risk to you. Our job is to simply find people who need money for business purposes. As long as you can help people solve their money problems, you will never have money problems of your own. You can make money as soon as the Day after you get started. In this industry we can get businesses funding within 24 hours and we get paid from the direct lenders after the business is funded.

This is true in the organizational setup when coaches and mentors are required not only to expand their individual and collective capacity for responding to the current requisite needs of the company, but also to increase the human capacity for fulfilling the increased demands of tomorrow. However, there is a critical relationship between the coaches or mentors and the team members, and often the conversation between the two ends up getting worse, which could be due to the differences in their expectations and lack of the control on one\u2019s emotions. A leader has to display his capability as the coach, but at the same time he ought to be mentoring and it is vice-a-versa. After all, the main purpose of coaching and mentoring is to increase the knowledge and skills as per the organizational setup but it all depends upon the way it is delivered, making it critically imperative to understand the difference between the two terms.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExplore the purposes of coaching and mentoring and recognize how they differ. Identify the ways coaching and mentoring contribute to corporate performance. Discover the best practices and actions to integrate coaching and mentoring into your organization successfully.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECoaching means imparting necessary skills, training, guidance or any other instructions to subordinates or juniors which could help them perform at their best and accomplish the task. The Coach has to assist the person to learn the requisite skills, attitude and behavior for performing the work successfully and within the set parameters. All the tasks are precisely described with essential details, clear focus and in specific timelines while mentoring goes much beyond the conventional work structure to focus on the individual\u2019s emotional and behavioral aspects. During the mentoring process, the interaction could be more philosophical, psychological and emotional with the individual as the whole criteria are taken into the perspective.

It talks and explains the networking basics which is much more helpful for the beginners who are new to the world and domain of networking. This OSPF Certification course of Routing Protocol OSPF builds a strong foundation for them to prepare for good level certifications like CCNA. You will be able to learn all the terminologies and key functionalities related to routing protocols. There is n number of routing protocols that are developed today but only very few have been adopted by the industry. In this course, all those concepts will be explained in detail and you can practice them at your ease. The broad areas to be covered are related to configurations, operations, and troubleshooting. Apart from that, there are a few use cases of two very popular Routing protocols that work on the principle of OSPF and have their level of advantages. This OSPF Certification Module describes how to connect and configure and operate Open Shortest Path First which was specifically designed for IP networks and therefore supports IP tagging and sub-netting of extremely derived information related to routing. It also allows the packet-based information and authentication to take place and also makes use of the multicast for Internet protocol when either sending or receiving any packet\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis course module named Routing Protocols RIP and EIGRP is quite similar to the one used above and is also responsible to teach you many basics and fundamental concepts such as those related to troubleshooting, operation, and configuration. The two most important routing protocols which will be explained in detail are the RIP also known as Routing information protocol and the other is EIGRP which is the abbreviated form for Extended interior Gateway protocol. In the RIP protocol, the oldest of the vectors for distance IP Routing protocols are still put to use and thereby getting various enhancements. There are currently two versions that exist for the RIP viz. RIPv1 and RIPv2. RIPv1 is also said to be the classful protocol which means that it is not classless whereas if you talk about the RIPv2, it is considered to be the classless support routing protocol and IPv6 is the one whose support is extended to RIPv2 with the next-gen RIP which is also termed as RIPng. EIGRP, on the other hand, is related to the Interior Gateway protocol as it is a proprietary protocol of the company CISCO. This protocol is occasionally described as the distance vector routing protocol which also acts and imitates like a link state-oriented protocol. Distance vector-based protocols share everything of which they are aware of. The only limitation they carry is that the amount of information shared is only among the neighbors which are directly or indirectly connected with each other. Link state-based protocols announce that the information present is only about the direction and not indirectly connected links. However, they are also responsible to share the routing protocol information among themselves in all the areas they deem fit among all the routes in their domain or area.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/cisco-ospf-hands-on-certification-training/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4844382_3644_3.jpg","duration":"10.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"6,792.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["The target audience for this course is anybody who has a keen interest in the field of digital communication and is also aware of how the basics of understanding the networks and other routing protocols and mechanisms such as OSPF Routing.

Two fundamental principles of Islamic banking are the sharing of profit and loss and the prohibition of the collection and payment of interest by lenders and investors. In Islamic banking, the banks do not collect interests from creditors. Instead, they earn money using equity participation systems and share profits and losses. Islamic finance is practiced in many Muslim countries and is extremely popular among Islamic communities, as some conventional banking practices might be against Shariah. Islamic finance is considered more ethical than conventional banking, as it believes that a bank and its clients should make profits and losses together.

It assumes that you\u0027re new to the language, so it gets you started with basic functionality such as creating functions, creating variables, and calling these lines of code from your standard HTML pages. It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E*\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E javascript course contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript introduction\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript array\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript variables\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript functions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript objects\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript control statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript cookies\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript loop statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript data structures\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript error handling\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript regular expressions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003Esection 2- learn PHP\u0026nbsp;programming language\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis section will learn the basic structure of a web application and how a web browser interacts with a web server.
