In this training course you will review multiple practical tasks and coding examples which will help you learn and understand Java better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E- Open source code\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe hide nothing from our students!\u0026nbsp;Including the source code for the hometask solutions and source code of examples which were shared during the lesson. Having the source code you can just copy and paste it to run it on your local computer to understand how things work better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou are allowed to use all source code examples for learning purposes. This helps significantly to configure environment and make tests work, especially in case student didn\u0027t work with any testing framework in the past.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E- Q\u0026amp;A support\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe significant difference between online and offline learning process is instructor\u0027s availability.

Information which is shared there is very old and significantly out of date. For example, instructor teaches framework which is not used already for 15 years. Or instructor do a stress on the programming design which is not used anymore at all!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstructor of this course is consultant in the top-rated IT\u0026nbsp;outsourcing company and helps to bring cutting-edge solutions in IT for all his clients.
