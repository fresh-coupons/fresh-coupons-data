How does a seemingly simple combination of text and images create an interactive and dynamic user experience? The answer lies in the trinity of web development: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Together, these three technologies form the backbone of modern web design and development, enabling the creation of engaging, accessible, and responsive websites.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn this introductory course, we will delve into the essentials of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a solid foundation for aspiring web developers. By the end of this course, you will have a strong understanding of these technologies and be well-equipped to embark on your journey in web development.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHTML: The Structure of the Web\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/strong\u003EHTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the cornerstone of any webpage. At its core, HTML provides the basic structure and content of a webpage. It uses a system of tags and attributes to define elements like headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more. These tags act as containers for content, allowing developers to create a meaningful and organized layout for their webpages.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you begin your study of HTML, you will learn about the key elements that make up the structure of a webpage. These include the doctype declaration, the html element, head and body elements, and a variety of content-specific tags. You will also explore semantic HTML, which emphasizes the use of meaningful tags to convey the purpose and structure of content, ultimately making the web more accessible and search-engine friendly.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECSS: Styling the Web\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/strong\u003EWhile HTML provides the foundation of a webpage, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) brings it to life with style and flair. CSS is a stylesheet language that allows developers to control the visual presentation of HTML elements, including colors, fonts, layout, and even animations. By separating content (HTML) from presentation (CSS), developers can create consistent and maintainable designs across multiple webpages.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThroughout this course, you will explore various CSS properties and selectors that allow you to target and style specific HTML elements. We will cover topics such as the box model, positioning, typography, and responsive design principles. You will learn how to create external stylesheets, enabling you to easily apply consistent styles to multiple webpages. Ultimately, you will gain an understanding of how to create visually appealing and accessible web designs.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavaScript: Interactivity and Dynamic Content\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/strong\u003EThe final piece of the web development puzzle is JavaScript, a powerful and versatile programming language. JavaScript breathes life into your webpages by enabling interactivity, dynamic content, and real-time updates. With JavaScript, you can create responsive user interfaces, validate user input, and even build complete web applications.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn this section of the course, you will learn the fundamentals of JavaScript, including variables, data types, functions, and control structures. You will explore the Document Object Model (DOM), a programming interface that allows JavaScript to interact with and manipulate HTML and CSS. Additionally, you will gain insight into key concepts such as event handling, asynchronous programming, and AJAX.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EBy understanding how JavaScript interacts with HTML and CSS, you will have the ability to create dynamic and engaging web experiences that respond to user input and adapt to different devices and screen sizes.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPutting It All Together\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/strong\u003EAs you progress through this course, you will work on various hands-on projects that will help solidify your understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These projects will challenge you to apply the concepts you have learned, allowing you to create functional and visually appealing webpages.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EBy the end of this foundational course, you will be well-prepared to tackle more advanced web development topics, such as responsive design, accessibility, performance optimization, and even server-side programming.

This course covers an extensive amount of material and by the end you will be proficient enough with AWS to gain an entry level position in cloud administration.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe curriculum starts off with exploring AWS account registration, billing and multi-factor authentication. We then explore more advanced account security through AWS identity and access management (IAM). IAM is an integral part of AWS that facilitates the management of users, groups, and security policies that control AWS resources. Here, we explore the creation of IAM users with varying degrees of account access. This includes user groups, permission policies, and IAM roles for EC2.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOnce students have a firm understanding of IAM, we dive into the backbone of AWS by exploring EC2 instance deployment and configuration. EC2 is a core service of AWS that facilitates the launch of virtual servers (called instances) within the AWS cloud console. We cover how to launch and configure EC2 instances, including choosing the right instance type and setting up security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic. We also explore remote instance administration using PuTTY and Terminal to issue server commands and manage instances from any remote location. Students learn to deploy and assign elastic IP addresses along with the creation of Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) to save instance state and quickly launch new instances with replicated configurations.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAfter completion of the EC2 module, we jump into AWS storage solutions where we explore various storage types including, block, file and object storage. More specifically students learn to harness the power of the Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) and the Amazon Elastic File System (EFS). We demonstrate how to deploy and configure multiple EBS volumes and attach them to existing instances for maximum scalability. Students also learn to design and deploy seamlessly scalable storage systems using EFS. We demonstrate how to mount multiple instances to a single EFS endpoint for centralized access to data files. We complete the module by showcasing the power of EBS snapshots and Amazon Machine Images for efficient instance deployment and backups.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EFrom this point, the course branches into more intermediate concepts by exploring elastic load balancing (ELB), Auto Scaling Groups (ASG), and Route 53. Student will learn to deploy a highly available architecture that auto scales based on real-time traffic workload and instance health checks. Traffic will be routed directly through Amazons Route 53 DNS service, with customized domain names and pre-configured hosted zones.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EBy the end of this course, you will have a solid understanding of how to use AWS to build and deploy your own cloud-based infrastructure. You will be able to launch and configure EC2 instances, store and manage data in the cloud, and use services like ELB and ASG to scale your infrastructure to meet the needs of your applications.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIf you\u0027re excited about expanding your knowledge in AWS and the field of cloud computing, hit the enroll button and let\u0027s get started.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-beginner-to-intermediate-ec2-iam-elb-asg-route-53/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5029488_f4fc_5.jpg","duration":"9.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"30,241.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Students interested in Cloud Computing with AWS","Students interested in learning the foundations of Amazon Web Services","Students interested in administering AWS accounts using Identity and Access Management (IAM)","Students interested in securing AWS accounts by assigning Access Privileges to IAM Users","Students interested in deploying Virtual Servers on AWS","Cloud Computing Enthusiasts looking to gain knowledge on using AWS","Students interested in learning about the Amazon EC2 Service","Students interested in learning various AWS Storage Solutions for EC2 (EBS, EFS)","Students interested in learning Dynamic Scaling, Elastic Load Balancing, and Auto Scaling Groups","Students interested in Managing Domain hosted zones using Amazon Route 53"],"tags":["Cloud Computing","Amazon EC2"],"rating":{"count":171,"averageValue":"4.5"},"instructors":[{"name":"YouAccel Training","url":"/user/youaccel/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.5652175}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"YOUACCEL72984","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"\u20B9449","expirationText":"5 hours","discountPercentage":44}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/fast-live-project-in-c-net-core-by-windows-forms-sql-db/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5365592,"title":"Fast C# .NET Core Live Project in Windows Forms and SQL","shortDescription":"Real World Project From Scratch by Windows Forms - C# Net Core 6 by SQL Database - Crystal Reports","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EHi There!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith my 23 years programming skills I am with you to share my knowledge with you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you try you will be a c sharper!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you wanna make a lot of money!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you wanna find best jobs in programming!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you Want to learn the C# .NET Core\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are beginners or student looking for a tutorial that teach c# with real project in simplest way!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want really to be a programmer so it is best place that you can start to learn C#.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis course includes :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStart using C# with Visual Studio 2022 From Scratch\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDesigning Main Form\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing SQL in C# by ADO.
