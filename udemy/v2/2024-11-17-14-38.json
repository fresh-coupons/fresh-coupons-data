Epithelium, connective tissue, muscle tissue, and nervous tissue have commonalities but look very distinct structurally after staining. Each stain exists to highlight an important feature or component within a tissue type. For example, one of the most common stains, Hematoxylin, is a basic dye that stains proteins a blue color, while Eosin stains proteins a pink color. These two stains are commonly used together to define intracellular organelles and proteins. Because of the variety of the proteins that exist, some stains were created to highlight a particular protein, which this review will discuss in the following sections. The benefit of using a special stain is that it can highlight the specific protein very well. However, because of its specificity, the other structures will not be seen. For this reason, multiple slides will often be created from a given specimen so that multiple stains can be performed to gather the full range of needed information.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlmost all tissue stains are performed on tissue that has been removed from the body. However, in rare instances, very specialize stains called vital stains can work on tissue remaining in the body. These stains are used for the identification of specific types of tissue and identification of abnormal tissue, so a subsequent biopsy can be more accurate in obtaining abnormal tissue\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETissue Preparation\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore specific staining can occur, tissue samples must undergo preparation through the following stages: Fixation, processing, embedding, sectioning, and sometimes antigen retrieval. In modern histology laboratories, most of these steps are automated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E.\u003Cstrong\u003EFixation: \u003C/strong\u003EFixation uses chemicals to preserve the structure of the tissue in its natural form and protects it from degradation by irreversibly cross-linking proteins. Although several specialized fixatives are available, Neutral Buffered Formalin is a common choice for this step. The fixation step is vital to the rest of the histologic staining procedure because by retaining the chemical composition of the tissue, the sample is hardened and makes the sectioning phase easier. Paraffin-formalin is another effective fixative. Its benefit is that it is the fixative of choice for immunostaining; however, it requires preparation at the time of the fixation. Bouin is a fixative used for examining embryo and brain tissue because of its superior preservation of delicate nuclei and glycogen. Its downside is that it does not preserve kidney tissues well and also distorts mitochondrial structure.[1]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDehydration: \u003C/strong\u003EThe addition of ethanol accomplishes the dehydration of a sample. It removed water from the sample and further hardens the tissue for eventual light microscopy. After ethanol is applied, and following the completion of tissue dehydration, xylene is used to remove the ethanol.[1]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEmbedding: \u003C/strong\u003EEmbedding is the process of putting the sample into a paraffin wax or a plastic resin to enhance the process of extracting cellular structures. This step is to be performed with caution if the goal is to perform immunostaining because the paraffin wax will inhibit the penetration of antibodies, and lead to a false result.[1]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESectioning: \u003C/strong\u003ESectioning involves mounting the specimen on a microtome and cutting it into sections. The preferred thickness is 4-5 micrometers so that it can be stained and put on a microscope slide for examination.[1]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAntigen Retrieval: \u003C/strong\u003EThis step is to retrieve antigens that could have been covered in the fixation and embedding stages. If the cross-linking of proteins conceals the antigen sites, there may not be as robust of an immunohistochemical response. Antigen retrieval is achieved through heating and proteolytic methods to break down the cross-links and reveal the epitopes and antigens that were previously covered.[1] Although this step carries the risk of denaturing both the fixative and the antigens themselves, a successful antigen retrieval method can lead to a much more effective immunostaining

commercial broiler farms should be prepared to receive new chicks. If litter has been recycled, it may be turned, treated, and/or otherwise managed to reduce ammonia, pathogen ,and insect load. Houses will be heated to provide adequate temperature for the chicks and feed and water lines may be primed so that they are at room temperature prior to placement. Temperature maybe uniform within houses or a temperature gradient may be provided to allow chicks to better\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eadjust their individual temperatures. If a temperature gradient is provided, feeders and waterers should be placed so that birds can adjust their temperature and still have easily access to feed and water. In general, chicks are placed at a ground temperature of approximately 90-95\u00B0F (32.2-35\u00B0C) and temperature is decreased as the birds age at approximately 5\u00B0F (2.8\u00B0C)/week until the temperature is around 70\u00B0F (21\u00B0C). However, this greatly varies based on the management system and breed of bird so temperature should be adjusted based on flock behavior . Many commercial broiler houses have some or extensive environmental control and the ability to implement standard program flock profiles for temperature and ventilation. Chickens in these environments Temperature \u0026amp; ventilation Uniformity of ventilation is ideal to improve flock performance. Poor ventilation may pro-mote excessive litter moisture and increase the exposure of the chickens to enteric pathogens. Poor ventilation may cause excessive ammonia levels, which could be detrimental to the health and welfare of animals and employees\u0026nbsp; Excessive ammonia at the level of the chicks may be less detectable to a standing human and high levels can cause health problems such as corneal ulceration, conjunctivitis, and inflammation/deciliation of the trachea thereby predisposing birds to respiratory pathogens. Broiler processing Based on market needs, broilers will be processed at a target weight or age determined by the individual company. Loading chickens into transport vehicles to move to processing may be done at night or early morning to decrease physical and heat stress during loading. At the processing plant, misting or fans may help keep birds cool and reduce mortality while birds are waiting to be processed. In colder regions, heating systems may be needed. Handling of birds at processing, including unloading and shackling, should be done in a way to minimize trauma to the birds, which would not only be a welfare concern but would lead to increased condemnations. Birds should be rendered unconscious and/or euthanizedin a manner that does not cause undue stress, increase condemnations, or adversely affect food safety.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/poultry-farming-broiler-farming-crash-course/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4750792_a09c_3.jpg","duration":"4 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"11,552.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["poultry farming lovers"],"tags":["Poultry Farming"],"rating":{"count":56,"averageValue":"3.6"},"instructors":[{"name":"Mohamed AL ashram","url":"/user/mohamed-taha-288/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":3.3}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"D86DBE054EC03C1A89D5","originalPrice":"\u20B91,799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"\uD83E\uDD37\u200D\u2640","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/poultry-farming-bacterial-diseases-hindering-satisfying-prod/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4744630,"title":"poultry farming Bacterial diseases hindering satisfying prod","shortDescription":"bacterial diseases of poultry","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003Eaclear example of poultry disease hinder satisfying poultry production is collibacillosis\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the localized or systemic infection caused by \u003Cem\u003Eavian pathogenic Escherichia Coli (APEC\u003C/em\u003E).

Once stimulated by a vaccine, the antibody-producing cells, called B cells (or B lymphocytes), remain sensitized and ready to respond to the agent should it ever gain entry to the body. A vaccine may also confer passive immunity by providing antibodies or lymphocytes already made by an animal or human donor. Vaccines are usually administered by injection (parenteral administration), but some are given orally or even nasally (in the case of flu vaccine). Vaccines applied to mucosal surfaces, such as those lining the gut or nasal passages, seem to stimulate a greater antibody response and may be the most effective route of administration.

Prior to that use, however, the principle of vaccination was applied by Asian physicians who gave children dried crusts from the lesions of people suffering from smallpox to protect against the disease. While some developed immunity, others developed the disease. Jenner\u2019s contribution was to use a substance similar to, but safer than, smallpox to confer immunity. He thus exploited the relatively rare situation in which immunity to one virus confers protection against another viral disease. In 1881 French microbiologist Louis Pasteur demonstrated immunization against anthrax by injecting sheep with a preparation containing attenuated forms of the bacillus that causes the disease. Four years later he developed a protective suspension against rabies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVaccine effectiveness\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehistorical mass vaccination programs in the United States\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter Pasteur\u2019s time, a widespread and intensive search for new vaccines was conducted, and vaccines against both bacteria and viruses were produced, as well as vaccines against venoms and other toxins. Through vaccination, smallpox was eradicated worldwide by 1980, and polio cases declined by 99 percent. Other examples of diseases for which vaccines have been developed include mumps, measles, typhoid fever, cholera, plague, tuberculosis, tularemia, pneumococcal infection, tetanus, influenza, yellow fever, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, some types of encephalitis, and typhus\u2014although some of those vaccines are less than 100 percent effective or are used only in populations at high risk. Vaccines against viruses provide especially important immune protection, since, unlike bacterial infections, viral infections do not respond to antibiotics\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVaccine types\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow the polio vaccine changed the world\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe challenge in vaccine development consists in devising a vaccine strong enough to ward off infection without making the individual seriously ill. To that end, researchers have devised different types of vaccines. Weakened, or attenuated, vaccines consist of microorganisms that have lost the ability to cause serious illness but retain the ability to stimulate immunity. They may produce a mild or subclinical form of the disease. Attenuated vaccines include those for measles, mumps, polio (the Sabin vaccine), rubella, and tuberculosis. Inactivated vaccines are those that contain organisms that have been killed or inactivated with heat or chemicals. Inactivated vaccines elicit an immune response, but the response often is less complete than with attenuated vaccines. Because inactivated vaccines are not as effective at fighting infection as those made from attenuated microorganisms, greater quantities of inactivated vaccines are administered. Vaccines against rabies, polio (the Salk vaccine), some forms of influenza, and cholera are made from inactivated microorganisms. Another type of vaccine is a subunit vaccine, which is made from proteins found on the surface of infectious agents. Vaccines for influenza and hepatitis B are of that type. When toxins, the metabolic by-products of infectious organisms, are inactivated to form toxoids, they can be used to stimulate immunity against tetanus, diphtheria, and whooping cough (pertussis).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how vaccines enhance the human immune system to fight against harmful pathogens\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ehistory\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ein the late 20th century, advances in laboratory techniques allowed approaches to vaccine development to be refined. Medical researchers could identify the genes of a pathogen (disease-causing microorganism) that encode the protein or proteins that stimulate the immune response to that organism. That allowed the immunity-stimulating proteins (called antigens) to be mass-produced and used in vaccines. It also made it possible to alter pathogens genetically and produce weakened strains of viruses. In that way, harmful proteins from pathogens can be deleted or modified, thus providing a safer and more-effective method by which to manufacture attenuated vaccines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVaccinology is \u003Cstrong\u003Ethe science and engineering of developing vaccines to prevent infectious diseases\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EVaccines contain antigens that stimulate the immune system to produce an immune response that is often similar to that produced by the natural infection\u003C/strong\u003E.

Two types of HPV vaccines have been developed, including a bivalent HPV vaccine, made using VLPs of HPV types 16 and 18, and a tetravalent vaccine, made with VLPs of HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother approach, called naked DNA therapy, involves injecting DNA that encodes a foreign protein into muscle cells. The cells produce the foreign antigen, which stimulates an immune response.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVaccines based on RNA have been of particular interest as a means of preventing diseases such as influenza, cytomegalovirus infection, and rabies. Messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines are advantageous because the way in which they are made allows them to be developed more quickly than vaccines made via other methods. In addition, their production can be standardized, enabling rapid scale-up for the manufacture of large quantities of vaccine. Novel mRNA vaccines are safe and effective; they do not contain live virus, nor does the RNA interact with human DNA.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eadvantage and dis advantage\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBenefits of vaccination\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFind out from Dr. Tina Tan of Northwestern University why adult vaccination against various types of diseases is important\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee all videos for this article\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to the development of memory B cells, which are capable of triggering a secondary immune response upon exposure to the pathogen targeted by a vaccine, vaccination is also beneficial at the population level. When a sufficient number of individuals in a population are immune to a disease, as would occur if a large proportion of a population were vaccinated, herd immunity is achieved. That means that if there is random mixing of individuals within the population, then the pathogen cannot be spread throughout the population. Herd immunity acts by breaking the transmission of infection or by lessening the chances of susceptible individuals coming in contact with a person who is infectious. Herd immunity provides a measure of protection to individuals who are not personally immune to the disease\u2014for instance, individuals who, because of their age or underlying medical conditions, cannot receive vaccines or individuals who received vaccines but remain susceptible. Herd immunity played an important role in the successful eradication of smallpox, and it is vital in preventing the spread of diseases such as polio and measles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdverse reactions\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVaccination carries some risk of reaction, though adverse effects typically are very rare and very mild. The most common reactions to vaccines include redness and soreness around the vaccination site. More severe adverse reactions, such as vomiting, high fever, seizure, brain damage, or death, are possible for some vaccines. Such reactions are exceptionally rare, however\u2014occurring in less than one in a million people for most vaccines. Severe reactions also tend to affect only certain populations, such as persons whose immune systems are compromised by preexisting disease (e.g., HIV/AIDS) or who are undergoing chemotherapy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClaims have been made that vaccines are responsible for certain adverse health conditions, particularly autism, speech disorders, and inflammatory bowel disease. Some of those claims focused on thimerosal, a mercury-containing compound used as a preservative in vaccines. Some people believed that autism was a form of mercury poisoning, caused specifically by thimerosal in childhood vaccines. Those claims have been discredited. Still, misinformation and fear generated by false claims about associations between autism and vaccines had a significant impact on individuals\u2019 perceptions about vaccine safety. In addition, most individuals in countries where vaccination is widespread have never personally experienced vaccine-preventable disease. Thus, the focus of concern for some people shifted from the negative effects of vaccine-preventable disease to the possible negative effects of the vaccines themselves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComplacency about vaccine-preventable diseases, combined with concerns over the effects of vaccination, led to decreasing levels of vaccination coverage in some areas of the world. As a consequence, not only were individuals susceptible to vaccine-preventable diseases, but, at population levels, vaccination rates dropped low enough to cause losses of herd immunity, thereby allowing outbreaks of disease. Such outbreaks brought high costs to societies, especially in terms of health and medical care, disability and economic strain, and loss of life. In the 20th century in Japan, England, and Russia, for example, numbers of children vaccinated against whooping cough dropped sufficiently low so as to enable outbreaks of disease that involved thousands of children and resulted in hundreds of deaths\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/all-about-vaccine-and-vaccnation/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5182800_89bd_2.jpg","duration":"1.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"4,274.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Medical students and  all professionals concern with vaccination"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":27,"averageValue":"4.5"},"instructors":[{"name":"Mohamed AL ashram","url":"/user/mohamed-taha-288/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.5384617}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"9543C7739E6063462BA4","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"\uD83E\uDD37\u200D\u2640","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/elisa-principals-and-applications-for-professionals/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5129970,"title":"ELISA principals and applications for professionals","shortDescription":"ELISA fundementals","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003Ecourse provides comprehensive training on the ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) technique, equipping professionals with the knowledge and skills for real-world applications.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKey Topics:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EELISA Fundamentals:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETheoretical underpinnings of antigen-antibody interactions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVarious types of ELISA assays (direct, indirect, sandwich)\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComponents and functions of ELISA kits\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAdvanced Techniques:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDouble antibody sandwich ELISA for enhanced specificity\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECompetitive ELISA for quantifying small molecules\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnderstanding factors affecting ELISA performance (sensitivity, specificity)\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EApplications in Diverse Fields:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImmunodiagnostics of infectious diseases (e.g., COVID-19 testing)\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFood safety analysis (detecting foodborne pathogens)\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnvironmental monitoring (assessing pollutant levels)\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAllergen detection in food products\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAutoimmune disease diagnostics\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EData Analysis and Interpretation:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPrinciples of spectrophotometry and result interpretation\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStatistical analysis of ELISA data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuality control and validation procedures\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECourse Benefits:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGain a thorough understanding of ELISA principles and methodologies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster various ELISA applications relevant to your professional field.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDevelop critical skills in data analysis and interpretation of ELISA results.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecome proficient in performing and troubleshooting ELISA assays.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnhance your problem-solving abilities for diverse applications.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETarget Audience:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis course is designed for professionals from various backgrounds seeking to expand their knowledge and expertise in ELISA techniques.

Since so many biology topics overlap with basic principles of chemistry, you need a basic understanding and appreciation of chemistry to fully understand biology. For example, in Unit 1, we discussed that the atom is the first part of the biological hierarchy. In this unit, we provide an understanding of this foundational level of organization.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBiological Molecules\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBiological molecules are the essential molecules needed for life. These molecules can be organic or inorganic. Organic chemistry is the study of carbon, which is an element that forms strong covalent bonds essential for the foundational structures of all living things. Water, salts, acids, and bases are mostly essential inorganic molecules that facilitate many biological processes. All organisms contain organic biological molecules \u2013 carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and nucleic acid \u2013 that are essential to life.

In this unit, we explore the characteristics, components, and functions of cells. Learning about the structures of cells allows us to see the similarities and differences among organisms. Bacteria, plant, animal, and fungus cells are similar in many ways and contain many of the same small structures known as organelles. However, some characteristics help distinguish whether a cell belongs to an animal, plant, fungus, or bacteria. For example, all plant cells contain cell walls, while animal cells lack this particular extracellular structure. The water within a cell that presses against the cell wall gives a plant its rigidity and your celery its crunch!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eclassification\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClassification is a fundamental concept in biology.
