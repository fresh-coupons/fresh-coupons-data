Think command prompt as an interpreter that accepts the commands or the User\u2019s inputs and translate them into machine language. These commands are predefined and perform a specific task. These commands can be clubbed together as well to perform a series of task. Also, these commands need not be entered manually and can be written in a batch file to automate some of the manual tasks like taking a scheduled server backup, deleting junk files and so on. These commands are very handy at the time of network troubleshooting or for a day to day work. These commands can be called from many programming languages such as Java, which allows the programmer to perform task directly via the command prompt, which would otherwise take several code lines to be written essentially to perform the same task.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo run the command prompt in the administration mode, type cmd in the search bar present in the taskbar, then right-click on cmd.

A batch file may contain any command the interpreter accepts interactively and use constructs that enable conditional branching and looping within the batch file, such as IF, FOR, and GOTO labels. The term \u0022batch\u0022 is from batch processing, meaning \u0022non-interactive execution\u0022, though a batch file may not process a batch of multiple data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EHow to access CMD?\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo access the command prompt irrespective of what version you are using, follow the below steps.
