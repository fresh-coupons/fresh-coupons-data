related to them, how to create them, and what is the purpose of creating them easily.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimply, Iterator in Python is simply an object that can be iterated upon. An object which will return data, one element at a time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a brief and simple definition of Python iterator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s go to the second section, which we will talk about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the second section we will talk about The Python scope Of all kinds and how to deal with them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot all variables or functions can be accessed from anywhere in a program. The part of a program where a variable or function is accessible is called its scope.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe section that next, we\u0027ll talk about the string formatting To make sure a string will display as expected . and You\u2019ll learn about these formatting techniques in detail and add them to your Python string formatting toolkit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd in the fourth section we will know all about:\u003Cbr\u003EWhat generators in Python are and how to use them\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow to build generator functions and expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow the Python yield statement works and the difference between yield and return.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow to use multiple Python yield statements in a generator function.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow to use advanced generator methods in your apps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe section that next, you\u2019ll learn everything about regular expressions in Python.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a very important topic, and we will talk about it in a detailed and practical way and with deep clarification. Actually, You\u2019ll have all power of regular expressions, You will work with the re library, deal with pattern matching, and many more.\u003Cbr\u003EBasically, Regular Expressions are a tool for matching patterns in text. This is a brief and simple definition of Regular Expressions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the next section, you\u2019ll master the most commonly used data structures from the Python collections module. \u003Cbr\u003EBasically, Collections in Python are containers that are used to store collections of data, for example, lists and dictionaries. These are built-in collections. Several modules have been developed that provide additional data structures to store collections of data. One such module is the Python collections module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe collections module is used to improve the functionalities of the built-in collection containers. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next section walks you through how to package a simple Python project. It will show you how to add the necessary files and structure to create the package, how to build the package, and how to use this Package.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the next section, you\u2019ll master all about math and statistics modules practically, and the functions that are used with them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimply, the math module provides access to the mathematical functions defined by the C standard. and The statistics module provides functions for calculating mathematical statistics of numeric data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, In the last part of this course you will learn something very important, which is decoration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this section on decorators, we\u2019ll look at what they are and how to create and use them in detail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimply and By definition, a decorator is a function that takes another function and extends the behavior of the latter function without explicitly modifying it. that\u2019s it . We will simplify this topic very without complication, and with practical examples to illustrate.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/python-programming-beyond-the-basics-intermediate-training/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/3571361_5567.jpg","duration":"2.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"181,592.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Python Intermediate Developers","Anyone who wants to dive deeply into Python v3.9 Intermediate Topics without wasting time","Anyone who has finished the basics of Python and does not know where to go","Python developers who want to master new features of modern python"],"tags":["Python"],"rating":{"count":1037,"averageValue":"4.3"},"instructors":[{"name":"SDE Arts by Ahmed EL Mohandes","url":"/user/senior-microneer/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.40625}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"BF02FD89418905DD2781","originalPrice":"\u20B92,299","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/the-r-programming-for-everyone-a-z-comprehensive-bootcamp/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4294492,"title":"Data Science: R Programming Complete Diploma","shortDescription":"Learn all the R skills you need to become a Professional and Certified R Programmer with this Complete Bootcamp","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EHello and welcome to the exciting world of the R programming language.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E# \u003C/em\u003EData Science: R Programming Complete Diploma \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ER \u003C/strong\u003Eis one of the most powerful programming languages, for statistical computing and graphical presentation to analyze and visualize data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this course, I\u2019m going to show you how to code with R from the R basics to the R advanced concepts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, you will explore how the R programming language can be used today for data analysis and the production of beautiful data visualizations and graphics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best part?
