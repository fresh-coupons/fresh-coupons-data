A successful manager is now expected to act as a leader, a mentor, and a coach, guiding their team members towards individual and collective success. This paradigm shift highlights the significance of coaching techniques in the realm of managerial responsibilities.","The Transformation of Managerial Roles  Evolving Leadership Expectations  The traditional image of a manager as a stern authority figure has given way to a more holistic view of leadership. Managers are now expected to serve as role models, motivators, and mentors to their teams. This shift stems from the recognition that employees perform at their best when they feel valued, supported, and empowered.  The evolution of leadership expectations can be traced back to the changing dynamics of the modern workplace. In the past, managers were primarily responsible for enforcing rules and ensuring productivity. However, as organizations began to realize that employee engagement and satisfaction were crucial for success, a transformation in managerial roles ensued.  Today, managers are not just tasked with overseeing tasks and projects; they are expected to inspire and empower their teams. This shift is partly a response to the changing nature of work itself. In a knowledge-based economy, where creativity, innovation, and adaptability are paramount, traditional top-down management no longer suffices.","Coaching as a Leadership Skill  Coaching has emerged as a pivotal leadership skill that fosters personal and professional growth. We\u0027ll explore how coaching techniques, such as active listening, constructive feedback, and goal-setting, can empower managers to become effective leaders who inspire and guide their teams towards excellence.

Coaching knowledge equips managers with the ability to provide guidance that is not only aligned with the organization\u0027s needs but also tailored to the aspirations of individual employees.

It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are practicals of:\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E* Javascript Course Contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Array\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Variables\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Functions\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Objects\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/css-and-javascript-crash-course/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4271184_7325_2.jpg","duration":"1 total hour","enrolledStudentsCount":"121,406.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["For CSS And Beginners","For People Who want to learn CSS Fundamentals and later Transition into Web Designing","For People New to CSS And Javascript"],"tags":["CSS","JavaScript"],"rating":{"count":1883,"averageValue":"4.3"},"instructors":[{"name":"PROPER DOT INSTITUTE","url":"/user/vivek-dahibhate-2/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.214286}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"EB91D143E73FDB7B8FDE","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/como-crear-una-tienda-online-con-inteligencia-artificial/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5835882,"title":"C\u00F3mo Crear una Tienda Online con Inteligencia Artificial","shortDescription":"Aprende a c\u00F3mo crear una tienda online con Inteligencia Artificial de forma f\u00E1cil y simple, sin saber de programaci\u00F3n.","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u00BFDESEAS CREAR UNA TIENDA ONLINE CON LA AYUDA DE LA INTELIGENCIA ARTIFICIAL PARA VENDER TUS PRODUCTOS POR INTERNET?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECrear una tienda online con Inteligencia Artificial hace que todo sea m\u00E1s f\u00E1cil y te ahorra tiempo y esfuerzo, que puedes utilizar para tareas m\u00E1s importantes.
