It helps in finding cost-effective ways to acquire and retain customers, reduce operational costs, and increase average revenue per unit.  Investor Confidence: For startups and growing companies, demonstrating positive unit economics is often essential to attract investors.

It assumes that you\u0027re new to the language, so it gets you started with basic functionality such as creating functions, creating variables, and calling these lines of code from your standard HTML pages. It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E*\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E javascript course contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript introduction\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript array\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript variables\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript functions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript objects\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript control statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript cookies\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript loop statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript data structures\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript error handling\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript regular expressions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003Esection 4- learn PHP\u0026nbsp;programming language\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis section will learn the basic structure of a web application and how a web browser interacts with a web server.

It was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994. The PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group. PHP originally stood for \u003Cem\u003EPersonal Home Page\u003C/em\u003E, but it now stands for the recursive initialism \u003Cem\u003EPHP: Hypertext Preprocessor\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPHP code is usually processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module, a daemon, or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. On a web server, the result of the interpreted and executed PHP code \u2013 which may be any type of data, such as generated HTML or binary image data \u2013 would form the whole or part of an HTTP response. Various web template systems, web content management systems, and web frameworks exist which can be employed to orchestrate or facilitate the generation of that response. Additionally, PHP can be used for many programming tasks outside of the web context, such as standalone graphical applications and robotic drone control. Arbitrary PHP code can also be interpreted and executed via a command-line interface (CLI).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe standard PHP interpreter, powered by the Zend Engine, is free software released under the PHP License. PHP has been widely ported and can be deployed on most web servers on almost every operating system and platform, free of charge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe PHP language evolved without a written formal specification or standard until 2014, with the original implementation acting as the \u003Cem\u003Ede facto\u003C/em\u003E standard which other implementations aimed to follow. Since 2014, work has gone on to create a formal PHP specification.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs of January 2021, 72% of PHP websites use discontinued versions of PHP, i.e. PHP 7.2 or lower, which are no longer supported by The PHP Development Team. A large additional fraction uses PHP 7.3, which is only (up to December 6, 2021) \u0022supported for critical security issues only.\u0022 Over 40% of all PHP websites use version 5.6 or older, which not even Debian supports (Debian 9 supported version 7.0 and 7.1).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBeginner Friendliness\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEasy to Get Started With\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPHP was designed to make web development easier, and many beginners find it effortless to pick up and get started with. In fact, PHP code was so easy to pick up, many non-programmers end up being able to hack PHP code together without truly understanding the code. While good programmers will never copy and paste code they don\u0027t understand, this speaks volumes about how easy it is to pick up PHP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe latest version of PHP (PHP8) has fixed a lot of inconsistencies and fatal errors as well.

This means its execution is \u003Cem\u003Efast.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks to its versatility Dart can be used for client or server-side development. The syntax looks like \u2018C\u2019 meaning it is statically typed so this provides more certainty on the types of values you are passing on, but it is also meant to be used in OOP, if you have a background in C you\u2019ll pick it up quick.

AI is a field of computer science that studies how to create machines that can process information, make decisions, and perform specific tasks.","The History of modern AI. The field of artificial intelligence (AI) has a long and rich history, dating back to the early days of computing. However, the field as we know it today was founded in 1956 at a conference at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire. This conference brought together the leading researchers in AI at the time, including Alan Turing, John McCarthy, and Marvin Minsky. The conference is credited with helping to define the field of AI and to set the agenda for future research.","Artificial Intelligence \u201CAI\u201D is a complex field that needs the ability of people from diverse disciplines to work together.
