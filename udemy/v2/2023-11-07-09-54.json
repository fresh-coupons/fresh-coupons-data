This is an extensive project based course where you will learn step by step on how to build and design a fully functioning real time chat app just like Whatsapp or Facebook messengers. To build the chat app, we are going to use Javascript programming language alongside with websocket which will enable real time delivery messages and also Chat Engine IO which is a chat API that enables developers to integrate real-time chat to their website . In the introduction session, you will learn the basic fundamentals of web socket and get to know more about the chat app project that you are going to build. We are going to specifically talk about use cases and main features of real time chat apps. Then, in the next session, you will extensively learn about how websocket actually works, specifically, you will learn about interaction between server and client. Once, you have learnt all necessary knowledge about real time chat app and websocket, then, you will enter the main section of the course which is the project section, firstly, you will be guided step by step on how to set up your IDE, in this case, we are going to use VS Code as the IDE. Afterward, you will also learn step by step on how to set up a Chat Engine IO account and learn more about its documentation. Once everything is ready, we are going to get started building the real time chat app, the project section is consisted of two main parts, in the first part you will build a real time chat app using Chat Engine IO, meanwhile, in the second part, you will build real time chat app using Socket IO. Then, once the real time chat app has been built, we are going to be conducting testing on the app to make sure that it has been fully functioning and it has a friendly user interface. This course will be focusing on four main testing objectives, those are functionality testing, user experience testing, performance testing, and compatibility testing. Lastly, at the end of the course, we are going to talk about future enhancement and additional feature ideas to make the chat app even better, such as adding end to end encryption feature, adding screen sharing feature, adding voice and video calling features.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, before getting into the course, we need to ask this question to ourselves: why should we build a real time chat app? Don\u2019t you think the market for this particular product has been oversaturated since almost all social media platforms already have their own versions of chat app or direct messenger feature? Well, here is my answer, obviously building your own real time chat app is not intended to compete with Whatsapp or Facebook Messengers, instead, the chat app will be integrated with other projects, for instance, in a game application, the chat app can be used for communication between players, enhancing their gaming experience and facilitating teamwork or in E-commerce store, the chat app can be used to facilitate customer support, answer product queries, and help users make purchasing decisions. In addition to that, you are also going to learn a lot of valuable knowledge and skill sets from building real time chat apps, especially for those of you who are interested in app development, having this project in your portfolio can be used to showcase your capabilities to your future employers or future clients. Last but not least, knowing how to build a chat app can potentially open a lot of opportunities, both in your professional career or as an entrepreneur.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow are things that you are going to learn from this course:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn the basic fundamentals of real time chat app and WebSocket\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how WebSocket works specifically the interaction between server and client\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to create new user and new chat on Chat Engine IO\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to connect your chat app with Chat Engine IO API\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to initialize React project on VS Code terminal\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn step by step on how to build a real time chat app using Chat Engine IO\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to customize chat app user interface\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to enable email notification for chat app\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn step by step on how to build a real time chat app using Socket IO\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConduct testing to make sure the chat app has been fully functioning\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn several testing methods for chat app, such as functionality, user experience, performance, and compatibility testings\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGet to know several additional features that could be added to improve the chat app, such as end to end encryption, screen sharing, voice calling, video calling, and multi devices integration\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/building-real-time-chat-app-with-chat-engine-io-socket-io/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5636666_cc05.jpg","duration":"2.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"1,365.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["People who are interested in building real time chat app using Chat Engine IO","People who are interested in building chat App using Socket IO"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":0,"averageValue":"0.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"Christ Raharja","url":"/user/christ-raharja/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":0}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"0A0F788B162B574BC505","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/adobe-graphics-design-video-editing/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5048144,"title":"Essential Photoshop Course Beginner to Intermediate","shortDescription":"Learn Photoshop Layer, Color, Tools, Adjustment, Blur, Retouch","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EHello Everyone Welcome to essential photoshop course from beginner to intermediate level.

To run a business at optimal capacity, you need to reduce or eliminate waste from processes and improve production flow. In this course, you\u0027ll learn about Lean strategies to reduce waste by determining which operations add value and which don\u0027t. You\u0027ll explore the concept of continuous flow, and discover how to balance work processes to make production flow more efficient. You\u0027ll define what waste is, where it exists, and what causes it.

And in any business, one of the heaviest drains on profitability is waste. Lean waste can come in the form of time, material, and labor. But it may also be related to the utilization of skill-sets as well as poor planning. In lean manufacturing, waste is any expense or effort that is expended but which does not transform raw materials into an item the customer is willing to pay for. By optimizing process steps and eliminating waste, the only true value is added at each phase of production.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday, the Lean Manufacturing model recognizes 8 types of waste within an operation; seven originally conceived when the Toyota Production System was first conceived, and an eighth added when the lean methodology was adopted within the Western World.

To get a better idea of the possible demand for used cars in your area, you\u2019ll need to crunch some numbers. By knowing the number of used cars sold in your area every year and month , you can estimate what percentage of the market you will be likely to be able to corner and reach. By locating the average profit per vehicle, you can get an approximate idea of how much profit and money your dealership able to make per year. While the groundwork associated with opening a dealership can be time-consuming, expensive, and demanding, the real test of your dealership\u2019s viability doesn\u2019t begin until after you open your doors to the public. Without the right management of your dealership, all the effort you put into laying the foundation will be wasted. While each state has its own rules and regulations, there are several important universal aspects of operating a car dealership and tips on how you can get the most out of your investment. Your customers are the single most important factor in the success or failure of your business, so taking the time to identify who they are and what they care about is absolutely vital. Take a look at the types of cars you plan on selling, then do some research to determine the age, gender, and income level of the average individual who owns those types of vehicles. Later down the line, this will allow you to tailor your marketing and advertising efforts toward those who are most likely to be interested in what you have to offer. Make sure to base any of your conclusions regarding your target clients on real actionable data; don\u2019t simply make assumptions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/car-flipping-earn-money-from-selling-used-cars-ocsaly/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4741312_7b69_3.jpg","duration":"1.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"28,599.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Beginner Used Car Business Leaders"],"tags":["Car Flipping"],"rating":{"count":101,"averageValue":"4.1"},"instructors":[{"name":"OCSALY Academy | 270.000\u002B Students","url":"/user/online-academy-of-computer-science/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"OCSALY_YOUTUBE_1M","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/computer-forensics-and-digital-forensics-for-everyone/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5023282,"title":"Computer Forensics and Digital Forensics Masterclass 2023\u002B","shortDescription":"Learn computer forensics, digital forensics, mobile forensics, windows forensics, linux forensics and other forensics.","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EThis is the \u003Cstrong\u003Emost comprehensive, yet straight-forward, course for the Digital Forensics and Computer Forensics on Udemy!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E*Get the Official Certificate after Completing the Course\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis course is intended for anyone who wants to learn the basics of digital forensics and computer forensics.

The goal of computer forensics is to perform a structured investigation and maintain a documented chain of evidence to find out exactly what happened on a computing device and who was responsible for it. Computer forensics -- which is sometimes referred to as computer forensic science essentially is data recovery with legal compliance guidelines to make the information admissible in legal proceedings. The terms digital forensics and cyber forensics are often used as synonyms for computer forensics. Digital forensics starts with the collection of information in a way that maintains its integrity. Investigators then analyze the data or system to determine if it was changed, how it was changed and who made the changes. The use of computer forensics isn\u0027t always tied to a crime. The forensic process is also used as part of data recovery processes to gather data from a crashed server, failed drive, reformatted operating system (OS) or other situation where a system has unexpectedly stopped working.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy is computer forensics important?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the civil and criminal justice system, computer forensics helps ensure the integrity of digital evidence presented in court cases.

It is my hope that I am able to present the course to you in such a manner that you will not only understand electrical systems, but will excel at it. There are many ways the theory of electricity can be explained, and many metaphors can be used. Some compare electricity to a water flow, while others explain it in a purely scientific fashion. Everyone learns differently. I am presenting electrical theory in a manner that I hope will be clear and concise. If you do not fully comprehend a concept, then it is important to discuss it with your instructor.

They would specialize in engines, steering/ suspension, or brakes. Today, there is not a system on the vehicle that is immune to the role of electrical circuits. Engine controls, electronic suspension systems, and anti-lock brakes are common on today\u2019s vehicles. Even electrical systems that were once thought of as being simple have evolved to computer controls. Headlights are now pulse-width modulated using high side drivers and will automatically brighten and dim based on the light intensity of oncoming traffic. Today\u2019s vehicles are equipped with twenty or more computers, laser-guided cruise control, sonar park assist, infrared climate control, fiber optics, and radio frequency transponders and decoders. Simple systems have become more computers reliant. For example, the horn circuit on the 2008 Chrysler 300C involves three separate control modules to function. Even the tires have computers involved, with the addition of tire pressure monitoring systems!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday\u2019s technician must possess a full and complete electrical background to be able to succeed.

Digital cameras\u003Cstrong\u003E \u003C/strong\u003Eare built into doorbells; your smartphone tracks your daily movements from work to home and back; and you receive social media updates when you go to the gym, see a show, or visit a new city. Digital technology tracks your phone calls, bank transactions, and medical appointments. What about criminal or unethical behavior if it tracks your mundane daily activities?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat activity is also monitored, and as a\u003Cstrong\u003E \u003C/strong\u003Edigital forensic investigator, you\u0027ll need to understand where digital evidence is stored and how to analyse it. There is almost no criminal activity that does not involve digital evidence, and it is your responsibility as an investigator to gather all available evidence, process it, and present your findings to the authorities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInvestigators who work in the field of digital forensics must have a diverse set of skills and interests. The first question I ask anyone thinking about a career in this field is if they enjoy solving puzzles. You may not have access to any information other than the fact that something happened when investigating a case. So, if someone needs to be shown or told what happened, this field may not be right for them. When a case is brought to an investigator\u0027s attention, the investigator is often given instructions to figure out what the computer or device was used for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother important trait is the ability to deal with frustration, as investigative tools and software do not always work without problems. When it comes to cell phones and small devices, this is a fairly common occurrence. Many students, rather than working through the challenges, stop their investigation in class at the first sign of difficulty. They don\u0027t even try to figure out what\u0027s wrong with the tool by looking at the web or using the help system. To be a successful investigator, one must be persistent and creative \u2013 they must be problem solvers. Digital forensics is a branch of forensic science that collects, analyses, documents, and presents digital evidence related to computer crime for use in a court of law using scientific knowledge. Knowing what was done, when it was done, and who did it is the ultimate goal.
