I found this course created by TJ Walker a perfect introduction to the world of media training. I wanted to learn, not only what a media trainer does, but also what steps I would have to take in order to become a successful media trainer--TJ discusses all this in a clear and concise manner, in a tone that is welcoming and never alienating. The only constructive critique I would give would be concerning the technical form of the presentation, more specifically the video quality and picture aesthetic. Going by the current standard as it applies to video, everything we view is in high definition. Having said that, I believe the video quality could be improved upon as well as the backdrop which I found to be a bit generic and outdated. I found these minor flaws to be slightly distracting and given the high caliber of the speaker and the information being presented I believe these aspects detracted, if only marginally, from the quality of the product.\u0022\u0026nbsp;\u003C/em\u003ENick Cisik\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u00225 Stars!

This is a comprehensive tutorial for fashion designers and entrepreneurs who are interested in leveraging generative AI to create innovative clothing designs and also start your own clothing brand business. This course will give you a whole new perspective about the future of fashion design and you will be amazed by how far artificial intelligence has advanced in the past couple of years to the point where you can generate high quality designs from a single text prompt. In the introduction session, you will learn about AI applications in fashion design, understand how it can help you to automate the designing process and give you new design inspirations. Then, in the next session, we will start designing clothes using several AI tools like Refabric, The New Black, Cala, and AIO Wear. The process will be relatively straightforward, all you need to do is to write the prompt describing your desired clothes design, you can specify things like color, styles, texture, and in less than a minute AI will generate the design. In addition to that, we will use AI to convert your handwritten sketch into design and redesign your existing clothes, Afterward, in the next session, we will learn how to build a successful clothing brand business, we will talk about market overview, market research strategies, business models, and which marketplace or platform to sell your products. Then, we will also learn how to find high quality suppliers for your clothing brand business.

Well there are many reasons why and let me answer it from the perspective of fashion designers and clothing brand owners, generating fresh design concepts can be quite challenging and time consuming, requiring intense concentration and imagination exploration. Moreover, translating these designs from imagination to reality presents challenges, demanding attention to detail while sketching. Therefore, generative AI serves as an all in one solution, enabling the automatic transformation of designs into high-quality images, reducing the burdens of manual design processes. Lastly, the fashion industry remains in high demand as individuals seek to express themselves through their clothing and create comfortable and also stylish wardrobes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow are things that you can expect to learn from this course:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn about AI applications in fashion design\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to design clothes using The New Black AI\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to convert sketch to design using The New Black AI\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to design fabric pattern using The New Black AI\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to analyze fashion style using The New Black AI\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to design Jacket with Refabric\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to design hoodie with CALA\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to design polo shirt with AIO Wear\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to build a successful clothing brand.
