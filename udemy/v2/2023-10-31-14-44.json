We quickly move on to creating form-based surfaces and learn the basic concepts of modeling in Revit through several examples. Then, we delve into complex forms, and I can say that together we will create any form that you thought might be impossible to model in Revit and practice it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext, we will explore the fascinating topic of \u003Cstrong\u003Eparametric modeling\u003C/strong\u003E.
