Soerin guided me through the different research phases, from the literature review until the conclusion and recommendations. By asking probing questions instead of immediately giving the answers to my questions, Soerin not only contributed to a thesis that I\u2019m proud of, but also made me a better researcher. The recommendations that Soerin gave during his review of my thesis drafts were helpful and often formed the basis of new insights. When I hit a block while working on a factor analysis, Soerin helped me via a Skype session during which he looked at my SPSS and SmartPLS output live. Because of his enthusiasm, positive attitude and \u201Ccan do\u201D mentality, my interactions with Soerin were always pleasant and motivating.\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ESoerin, many thanks for your support!\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKevin \u003Cbr\u003EMaster of Science in Accountancy\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u0022I would definitely recommend Soerin as thesis advisor. Not only does Soerin help with the students plan for research, he also helps to\u0026nbsp;improve the plan by making recommendations for advanced research (and additional analyses). Soerin is a very\u0026nbsp;fine coach and works very structured, which triggers the students to be passioned. Soerin is easily accessible and responsive to questions and / or ambiguities. Soerin is\u0026nbsp;certainly willing to help the students when problems occur. Soerin has a lot of knowledge, not only in the content but also in the structure and design of the study. He may also communicate this knowledge in a proper way, so that things are understandable for others. Soerin reviewed the thesis very detailed, by making comments in Word. The review notes will be clear and transparent. Soerin is very keen on the support of your written pieces with appropriate citations. He also helps to make your writing style \u0027journal proof\u0027. He gives examples (references to pieces from other papers) and make suggestions to improve your writing style. Soerin motivates others to \u201Cget the best out of yourself\u201D. Upon reviewing my thesis also noticed me that Soerin always reviewed with the why question. With this, he triggers another to think even more about the background of the texts are written. I\u2019am very positive about the contact times I had with Soerin, he shares his information with great passion, he is patient and takes his time to help you with questions or ambiguities. I don\u2019t have any improvement points for Soerin as thesis advisor. Again, I would recommend Soerin to anyone!\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJosina \u003Cbr\u003EMaster of Science in Accountancy\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#3\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022\u003Cem\u003EMy masterthesis (in Health Law) was recently reviewed by Soerin. While this thesis was outside his field, he provided me valuable feedback on the most crucial parts of my thesis, which were the main relevance between the\u0026nbsp;research question and subquestions, applied thesis methodology and theoretical structure in order to achieve consistency between title, problem, purpose and research questions. I\u2019ve also asked him to review my Final Conclusion \u0026amp; Recommendations. While his profession is in accountancy, his tips and key notes were very helpful and motivated me to finetune my thesis in some certain aspects such as re-production of my research findings and used theoretical literature. I think it is a real added value to let your thesis review by a professional teacher, who reviews dozens of master thesis a week. At the end I would really recommend anyone to let it reviewed by Soerin, which will motivate you to take the extra mile to finish your thesis on time\u003C/em\u003E\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJessica\u003Cbr\u003EMaster in Law\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#4\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022\u003Cem\u003EI hereby would like to recommend Soerin\u0026nbsp;as thesis supervisor / mentor in writing.\n\n Not for your ego but as a huge benefit for future students.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThe reason why I would recommend him is because I believe he sees\u0026nbsp;himself failing when a student fails. The harmony in the interest of both him and the students makes the delivered service as a \u2018to be the standard of excellence\u2019 one.\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EWhen discussing actualities or supporting literature Soerin is\u0026nbsp;spot on! He knows what you are talking about which gives the thesis writer a lot of comfort every check. The support by reviewing the thesis on a detailed way is very valuable. His review is of a high quality which is helpful to improve a structured writing style.\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThe interaction between Soerin\u0026nbsp;and the students is good. He is\u0026nbsp;a go-to-person (approachable). Besides that, he\u0026nbsp;is\u0026nbsp;very flexible in reviewing a thesis or answering question by e-mail or a text message.\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThe knowledge he has\u0026nbsp;about\u0026nbsp;collecting data and analysing the data is of an excessive high level. Multiple programs to analyse but also multiple ways to analyse. To connect the dots for a student in times they need it the most is a comfortable action. For example: In my experience I was stuck in an analysis and he\u0026nbsp;did not tell me the answer, but showed me a door which made me think of how to deal with a hurdle.\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EImprovement can be accomplished on the areas of stopping a student when a student is only focussed on deadlines and less on quality of previous handed in parts of the thesis. Second to It, an added value can be created by paying attention on used terminology and translations from English literature.\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EI want to thank Soerin by writing this letter.

It assumes that you\u0027re new to the language, so it gets you started with basic functionality such as creating functions, creating variables, and calling these lines of code from your standard HTML pages. It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables.

Below are some reasons why you should learn Deep learning in R\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\t1. It\u2019s a popular language for Machine Learning at top tech firms. Almost all of them hire data scientists who use R. Facebook, for example, uses R to do behavioral analysis with user post data. Google uses R to assess ad effectiveness and make economic forecasts. And by the way, it\u2019s not just tech firms: R is in use at analysis and consulting firms, banks and other financial institutions, academic institutions and research labs, and pretty much everywhere else data needs analyzing and visualizing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\t2. Learning the data science basics is arguably easier in R. R has a big advantage: it was designed specifically with data manipulation and analysis in mind. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\t3. Amazing packages that make your life easier. Because R was designed with statistical analysis in mind, it has a fantastic ecosystem of packages and other resources that are great for data science. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\t4. Robust, growing community of data scientists and statisticians. As the field of data science has exploded, R has exploded with it, becoming one of the fastest-growing languages in the world (as measured by StackOverflow). That means it\u2019s easy to find answers to questions and community guidance as you work your way through projects in R.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\t5. Put another tool in your toolkit. No one language is going to be the right tool for every job. Adding R to your repertoire will make some projects easier \u2013 and of course, it\u2019ll also make you a more flexible and marketable employee when you\u2019re looking for jobs in data science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat is the difference between Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPut simply, machine learning and data mining use the same algorithms and techniques as data mining, except the kinds of predictions vary. While data mining discovers previously unknown patterns and knowledge, machine learning reproduces known patterns and knowledge\u2014and further automatically applies that information to data, decision-making, and actions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDeep learning, on the other hand, uses advanced computing power and special types of neural networks and applies them to large amounts of data to learn, understand, and identify complicated patterns.

It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat is the Linear regression technique of Machine learning?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELinear Regression is a simple machine learning model for regression problems, i.e., when the target variable is a real value.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELinear regression is a linear model, e.g. a model that assumes a linear relationship between the input variables (x) and the single output variable (y). More specifically, that y can be calculated from a linear combination of the input variables (x).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen there is a single input variable (x), the method is referred to as simple linear regression.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen there are multiple input variables, the method is known as multiple linear regression.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy learn Linear regression technique of Machine learning?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are four reasons to learn Linear regression technique of Machine learning:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Linear Regression is the most popular machine learning technique\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Linear Regression has fairly good prediction accuracy\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.

It can also be a good introduction to the world of law for those with no legal background whatsoever (whether native or non-native English speakers). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the end of the course, you should have the basics of the language in each of the areas of law covered to be able to understand and communicate with others smoothly and accurately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach lesson is divided into 4 parts as follows: i) a video that introduces the student to the fundamental language in the field of law studied; ii) a video script for those who want to see all the contents in writing with key terminology highlighted in bold; iii) a series of questions that check the understanding of the contents of the video; iv) a \u201Cworkbook\u201D with practical exercises that make it necessary to use the fundamental concepts introduced through the video and finally v) answer key (found towards the end of the course).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome of the key areas of law covered include: Contracts; Business and Company; Property (both Intellectual and Real Estate); Legal Procedure (Civil and Criminal) and Litigation, among others.

Here, students learn the foundations of Linux and various Linux distributions such as Ubuntu to securely power web servers. Students will learn various Linux maintenance and directory commands, coupled with user account configuration and disabling root user access. From there, we dive into the foundations of database management systems and explore the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases. We also explore the two main database transaction standards, including ACID and CAP theorem. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOnce students have a solid understand on the foundations of cloud computing, we demonstrate how to securely install and configure LAMP Stack on Ubuntu.

This course teaches students how to create modern, interactive web pages using the Bootstrap framework and React JavaScript library. The course starts with an introduction into Bootstrap with a focus on its reputation in the development community as the number one choice for mobile-first front-end web frameworks. Bootstrap is a well documented collection of reusable code written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We start with exploring the foundations of Bootstrap, including embedding it into projects, and building out the basic Bootstrap page structure. From there we catapult into the infamous Bootstrap grid system, along with the commonly used three column web page layout. After the introductory topics, students learn to work with a number of components from typography, tables and image styling right up to wells, alerts, and buttons. As part of the course we demonstrate how to build out intricate navigation menus using dropdown, collapse, accordion, and pill menus. We will also cover form styling, carousels, modals, scrollspy and just about every other Bootstrap component that\u2019s instrumental to your journey as a front-end developer. The module concludes with a hands-on project, where students will use a Bootstrap theme to build a stunning web page from scratch.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn the second section of the course, we explore React. React, also known as React JS, is a powerful JavaScript library used for building custom, interactive user interfaces using UI components. Similar to Bootstrap, React is a well documented free and open source library. The project was founded by Meta and a network of independent developers. In this section, students learn how to use the React library through a series of hands-on projects. The React section of this course starts off with a hands-on project where you\u2019ll learn how to work with functional React components, props, Callback functions, OnClick Events, and the React State hook to build a fully functional calculator. From there we will dive into project number two, where you will build a connect-4 clone. Here we will cover more intermediate concepts including passing props, destructuring, passing arguments to click events, various styling methods, and handling callbacks. You will also learn about the React key property, React lifecycle events, and conditional rendering. By the end you will have built a complete multi and single player connect-4 game board with built-in AI capabilities. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn the final section of the course we further unleash the power of React by building out a complete e-commerce site with multiple product categories, a product showcase, shopping cart feature, and much more. Here, we introduce a number of integral new concepts including: JSON server, Fetch API, and installing React router. These essential building blocks will be used to render the product categories, style the product list, and configure the product details page. From there we dive into styled components, refactoring the shop layout, and exploring the concept of \u201Ccontext\u201D in React. In the final stages of the project students will configure the shopping cart basket, and the checkout feature. We will also implement a product search feature, followed by in-depth exercises on validating input forms in React.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAs you can see this course covers a tremendous bit of ground. Best of all it features Tim Maclachlan - a renowned senior full-stack developer with over 20 years of commercial development experience. As a multi-faceted developer, Tim specializes in algorithmic, analytical and mobile development.

React, also known as React JS, is a powerful JavaScript library used for building custom, interactive user interfaces using UI components. Some of the most well known examples of organizations using React for their front-end include Netflix, Facebook, and Airbnb. Developed and maintained by Meta along with a community of independent developers, React remains free and open-source. React is a component based library built entirely on JavaScript, which makes it perfect for designing complex UI\u2019s. With React, developers can build encapsulated components that efficiently manage their own state and render UI updates specifically when data changes. For example, think of the automated content refresh feature you see on a twitter feed, or facebook like button. Here the state of the UI component changes on the page, without having to manually refresh when the data is updated. This is just one small, yet powerful feature of React.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThrough a complete hands-on project, this course will teach you all the fundamental principles of React that you must know to become a proficient React developer. We start right from the basics, including the tools needed to get started. From there we dive into JSX, functional components, props, callbacks, and various OnClick events. By this stage, the calculator will have a complete visual display, coupled with functional arithmetic operations. Students then move on to passing parameters in Callback functions, using the React State Hook, and debugging.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn addition to the hands-on React module, we also offer a comprehensive overview of JavaScript for those who need a refresher. Here we start with introducing students to the document object model (DOM) which defines the logical structure of HTML documents. From there we dive into JavaScript to demonstrate various methods in which DOM elements can be manipulated to add interactivity to static components. We start right from the basics, which includes JavaScript placement, and data output. From there we move on to variable declaration, arithmetic operations, operator precedence, data types, and objects. Once the foundations are covered, we move on to more complex operations using Arrays, Conditional Statements, JavaScript comparison operators, booleans and loops. Here students will learn to unleash the true power of JavaScript to render different outcomes based on user interaction. We will explore the use of functions to efficiently handle repetitive tasks and JavaScript events to handle output based on actions and occurrences.

According to Stackoverflow JavaScript is the most popular programming language used by professional developers today. Even back-end developers choose JavaScript more often than not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E 2) It\u2019s in your browser\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJavaScript is, without question, the default language of the internet. You need to look no further than your browser for proof since JavaScript was most likely used to develop it. Since browsers are a necessary part of any user\u2019s online experience, it\u2019s easy to see why JavaScript is so significant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E3) JavaScript also exists outside of the internet\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJavaScript has many uses that go beyond its traditional internet roles. It powers smart televisions, works with the internet of things (IoT), creates native apps for iOS and Android, and builds cross-platform desktop apps, to name a few.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E4) JavaScript is Ideal for Newbies\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince it\u2019s already installed on every web browser today, JavaScript spares the rookies from the chore of setting up a development environment. Newcomers can just jump in and start coding. It\u2019s one of the most accessible entries into coding available, a value-add for beginners. There is also a large online community that offers support and advice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, JavaScript is an excellent tool for beginning programmers who want to expand their skill set into other languages. JavaScript supports valuable skills such as object-oriented, functional, and imperative styles of programming. Beginner developers, in turn, can apply these skills to any new language they want to learn, like Python, Java, or C\u002B\u002B.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E5) JavaScript is Easy to Learn\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot only is it a natural language to use, but JavaScript is also easy to pick up. JavaScript turns intricate details into abstracts, making things easier for the newcomer. Unlike the higher-level languages, JavaScript has more of a natural language feel to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E6) You Can Create Visual Effects and Other Eye-catching Aesthetic Features\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u2019s building a web page, and then there\u2019s building a visually appealing web page that attracts the user\u2019s attention and encourages interaction.

Organizations and clients want web designers who can not only put together a technically sound page but one that also will lure visitors. If you know JavaScript, you can deliver.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E7) JavaScript is Versatile\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFar from being a one-trick pony, JavaScript empowers a programmer to handle any aspect of app design. Do you want to do user-side (front-end) coding? You can do it in conjunction with Angular. Are you more interested in the server-side (back-end)? Bring Node.js into the mix and you can do that, too!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also create desktop, mobile, and web apps with Electron, React Native, and React. If you\u2019re intrigued by machine learning, then JavaScript will help you there as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E8) JavaScript also Affects Big Data and the Cloud\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is the go-to standard for data exchanges on today\u2019s internet.

Care has been taken that keyboard shortcuts are highlighted where they have been used, and also there is a brief recap of the start of each new session of what was covered earlier.
