There is almost no criminal activity that does not involve digital evidence, and it is your responsibility as an investigator to gather all available evidence, process it, and present your findings to the authorities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInvestigators who work in the field of digital forensics must have a diverse set of skills and interests. The first question I ask anyone thinking about a career in this field is if they enjoy solving puzzles. You may not have access to any information other than the fact that something happened when investigating a case. So, if someone needs to be shown or told what happened, this field may not be right for them. When a case is brought to an investigator\u0027s attention, the investigator is often given instructions to figure out what the computer or device was used for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother important trait is the ability to deal with frustration, as investigative tools and software do not always work without problems. When it comes to cell phones and small devices, this is a fairly common occurrence. Many students, rather than working through the challenges, stop their investigation in class at the first sign of difficulty. They don\u0027t even try to figure out what\u0027s wrong with the tool by looking at the web or using the help system. To be a successful investigator, one must be persistent and creative \u2013 they must be problem solvers. Digital forensics is a branch of forensic science that collects, analyses, documents, and presents digital evidence related to computer crime for use in a court of law using scientific knowledge. Knowing what was done, when it was done, and who did it is the ultimate goal. The term \u201Cdigital forensics\u201D is often used interchangeably with \u201Ccomputer forensics\u201D (also known as \u201Ccyber forensics\u201D), but it has come to encompass all devices capable of storing digital data, including networking devices, mobile phones, tablets, digital cameras, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, digital home appliances, and other digital storage media such as CD/DVD, USB drives, SD cards, external drives, and backup tapes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComputer Forensics is a specialization that deals with the recovery, examination and investigation of digital evidence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComputer Forensics is an applied science that deals with the recovery, examination and investigation of digital evidence.

The process of writing the software itself involves the planning required for developing the product. The key principle of the RAD process is a reduction in planning to focus on a highly iterative design and construction process, enabling teams to accomplish more in less time, without impacting client satisfaction. Apart from a shorter time-to-market, one of the most significant advantages of RAD is client involvement. RAD emphasizes incremental and iterative delivery of functioning models to the client instead of following a rigid process model like the traditional SDLC. Depends on strong team and individual performances for identifying business requirements. Only system that can be modularized can be built using RAD. Requires highly skilled developers/designers. High dependency on modeling skills. Only suitable for scalable, component-based systems \u2013 RAD is best used for large systems with multiple components. This is because, using RAD, many pre-developed components will be used, and it\u0027s not cost-effective to create a single component or piece of software for a smaller company.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this specialised master course you can learn the specialized topics of:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

By practicing public speaking, you learn how to prepare a message for each type of audience. For example, you would prepare a different speech for a fund-raising dinner than you would for a parent-teacher conference.

For example, if you must interview people for a job opening in your organization, you will get diverse candidates. You must be able to talk with them in person or on the phone and determine whether they have the combination of qualities to succeed in the job. You will have to communicate with them frequently if they join your work organization.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EImportance for Leadership\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of all, public speaking skills are important for leaders.

You should be able to ask questions, state what your organization needs, represent a position on an issue, respond to other people\u0027s opinions and build consensus.

Learn basics and advanced of JavaScript from scratch","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to my JavaScript course. \u003Cstrong\u003E JavaScript, aavaScript is a programming language\u003C/strong\u003E used primarily by Web browsers to create a dynamic and interactive experience for the user. Most of the functions and applications that make the Internet indispensable to modern life are coded in some form of JavaScript.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe earliest incarnations of JavaScript were developed in the late 1990s for the Netscape Navigator Web browser. At the time, Web pages were static, offering little user interaction beyond clicking links and \u003Cstrong\u003Eloading new pages\u003C/strong\u003E. For the first time, JavaScript enabled animation, adaptive content and form validation on the page.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor many years, JavaScript only functioned on a limited number of browsers. Microsoft\u0027s Internet Explorer, the largest browser base, did not support JavaScript until much later. Instead, Microsoft created its own proprietary client-side script called JScript. In the early days of \u003Cstrong\u003EWeb development\u003C/strong\u003E, programmers who wished to create dynamic websites were often forced to choose one browser family over the other. This was less than ideal because it made the Internet less universally accessible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJavaScript did not become standardized and widely adopted until 1999. Even after standardization, browser compatibility remained an issue for over a decade.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHow does JavaScipt work?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJavaScript is what is known as a client-side script. Most Web applications, \u003Cstrong\u003Esuch as a search engine\u003C/strong\u003E, work because of an interaction between the user\u0027s device (e.g. computer, \u003Cstrong\u003Ephone or tablet\u003C/strong\u003E) and a remote server. The software on the remote server sends information to the client (i.e. the user\u0027s machine) and the software on the client side reads the information and renders a Web page on screen.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EA client-side script is a programming language that performs its tasks entirely on the client\u0027s machine and does not need to interact with the server to function. For instance, if you have a Web page loaded on your computer and your Internet service provider goes down, you are still able to interact with the Web pages already loaded on your browser. You will not, however, be able to navigate to new Web pages or access any data located remotely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis JavaScript course is designed to take you zero to hero in coding.

The goal of computer forensics is to perform a structured investigation and maintain a documented chain of evidence to find out exactly what happened on a computing device and who was responsible for it. Computer forensics -- which is sometimes referred to as computer forensic science essentially is data recovery with legal compliance guidelines to make the information admissible in legal proceedings. The terms digital forensics and cyber forensics are often used as synonyms for computer forensics. Digital forensics starts with the collection of information in a way that maintains its integrity. Investigators then analyze the data or system to determine if it was changed, how it was changed and who made the changes. The use of computer forensics isn\u0027t always tied to a crime. The forensic process is also used as part of data recovery processes to gather data from a crashed server, failed drive, reformatted operating system (OS) or other situation where a system has unexpectedly stopped working.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy is computer forensics important?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the civil and criminal justice system, computer forensics helps ensure the integrity of digital evidence presented in court cases.

A false positive means that the system has (wrongly) authenticated an individual as being someone else and this can lead to a compromise of the security of the system.

Carrying out an ethical hack involves duplicating strategies and actions of malicious attackers. This practice helps to identify security vulnerabilities which can then be resolved before a malicious attacker has the opportunity to exploit them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso known as \u201Cwhite hats,\u201D ethical hackers are security experts that perform these assessments. The proactive work they do helps to improve an organization\u2019s security posture.
