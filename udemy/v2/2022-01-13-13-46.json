I am sure you are aware of such a situation\u2026 Nowadays children are no longer as creative as they once were.\u0026nbsp; We live in an era obsessed with numbers, data, and test scores, especially as they apply to our kids and their education.\u0026nbsp; Seeing the decline in creativity should make us concerned about our children\u2019s capacities to innovate, problem-solve, and navigate new and unfamiliar situations. \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the world of child development, you may hear the phrases like \u201Ccritical thinking skills\u201D and \u201Ccreative problem-solving abilities\u201D when referring to goals for your child\u2019s cognitive development. What we are really talking about is\u2026 imagination. The way to create human beings with imagination is to provide them with opportunities to develop it for themselves when they are very young. These opportunities are found in one place and one place only\u2026 that is, play. Playing with paints, playing with play dough, with costumes, with glue, and with crayons. Making a mess. Exploring the woods. Splashing in a puddle. Wondering at a caterpillar you notice inching by you. Pretending to be a bird, gliding through the sky.

The rise of AI will not be a threat in this new world order; rather, it will be a tremendous benefit. Not only is AI poised to impact the future of every single person and organisation in the world, but it is also poised to change the future of whole countries\u0027 governments, politics, and economies. As we move toward a world of totally automated work, we\u0027ll need to start adopting new rules and ideas.

There are still many jobs that we will have on our resume, but they will be less glamorous, fewer in number, and have little to do with our lives. We\u0027ll have far more disposable income, but it will be much greater still. The work, which will often be a repetitive, uninteresting and boring part of our jobs, will be replaced by the jobs of a new, automated digital future. This new age of automation and digital replacement will be of tremendous benefit to everyone but the workers themselves. The work will be performed on smart cloud computers and brilliantly capable-intelligent devices, which should offer us less of a challenge than ever before in recent history. If the future is any indication, a new and entirely digital world is now on the horizon. We are already seeing the results of this transition, with computers working across disciplines and tasks. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the newest and most amazing technologies is 3D printing, a process that is being used to create amazing items of art. This may not be practical, but it is something new that is just beginning to be experienced. People are inventing more and more advanced ways of creating things, not just for themselves, but for others. Even more incredible, our ability to design and create artificial intelligence and machines with their own personalities and motivations is being brought into the picture. As we make the machines smarter and more capable, each individual will have a role that is different than they would in any other scenario of the future. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany people see artificial intelligence as a danger, and they see the power of artificial intelligence in our personal lives, in our jobs, in our families. Artificial intelligence has created problems for many people. There is another possibility that has come along that we can think is a bit better, to begin with than what we are seeing today. One such possibility is a group that believes it can reverse engineer human DNA and then create a new biological \u0022self.\u0022 For this to happen, however, scientists first have to figure out a way to reverse engineer human DNA. Since we don\u0027t have the technological capability to reverse engineer human DNA today, this can be an extremely difficult path for anyone to take. The solution might not even be discovered until very late in the game until hundreds of years to come, however, and perhaps even we could lose much of our future. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s now talk about digital mind clone software where we can store our thoughts and ideas.

encompassing the recovery, investigation, examination and analysis of material found in digital devices, often in relation to mobile devices and computer crime. The term digital forensics was originally used as a synonym for computer forensics but has expanded to cover investigation of all devices capable of storing digital data. With roots in the personal computing revolution of the late 1970s and early 1980s, the discipline evolved in a haphazard manner during the 1990s, and it was not until the early 21st century that national policies emerged.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDigital forensics investigations have a variety of applications. The most common is to support or refute a hypothesis before criminal or civil courts. Criminal cases involve the alleged breaking of laws that are defined by legislation and that are enforced by the police and prosecuted by the state, such as theft and assault against the person. Civil cases on the other hand deal with protecting the rights and property of individuals (often associated with family disputes) but may also be concerned with contractual disputes between commercial entities where a form of digital forensics referred to as electronic discovery (ediscovery) may be involved\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring the 1980s very few specialized digital forensic tools existed, and consequently investigators often performed live analysis on media, examining computers from within the operating system using existing sysadmin tools to extract evidence. This practice carried the risk of modifying data on the disk, either inadvertently or otherwise, which led to claims of evidence tampering. A number of tools were created during the early 1990s to address the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDigital forensics is commonly used in both criminal law and private investigation. Traditionally it has been associated with criminal law, where evidence is collected to support or oppose a hypothesis before the courts. As with other areas of forensics this is often a part of a wider investigation spanning a number of disciplines. In some cases, the collected evidence is used as a form of intelligence gathering, used for other purposes than court proceedings (for example to locate, identify or halt other crimes). As a result, intelligence gathering is sometimes held to a less strict forensic standard.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"Englisch","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/digital-forensics-course/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4372164_7752_2.jpg","duration":"11,5 Stunden","enrolledStudentsCount":"9.415 Teilnehmer","lastUpdated":"Zuletzt aktualisiert: 1/2022","targetAudiences":["Beginner Digital Forensics Investigators"],"tags":["IT \u0026 Software","Netzwerk \u0026 Sicherheit","Digitale Forensik"],"rating":{"count":42,"averageValue":"4.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"OCSALY - Online Computer Science Academy","url":"/user/online-academy-of-computer-science/","totalNumberOfStudents":16381,"totalNumberOfReviews":86,"averageRating":3.9572774779069775}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"OCSALYFORENSICS","originalPrice":"11.200\u00A0\u20B9","discountedPrice":"7.280\u00A0\u20B9","expirationText":"5 Stunden","discountPercentage":35}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/corso-completo-di-inglese-per-principianti-assoluti/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4026436,"title":"Corso Completo Di Inglese Per Principianti Assoluti","shortDescription":"Impara In Modo Facile E Divertente La Lingua Inglese In Soli 3 Minuti Di Studio Al Giorno","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003ECiao!

Any contains only three predefined member functions: equals(), hashCode(), and toString().\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKotlin classes have to be marked with the open keyword in order to allow other classes to inherit from them; Java classes are kind of the opposite, as they are inheritable \u003Cem\u003Eunless\u003C/em\u003E marked with the final keyword. To override a superclass method, the method itself must be marked open, and the subclass method must be marked override. This is all of a piece with Kotlin\u2019s philosophy of making things explicit rather than relying on defaults. In this particular case, I can see where Kotlin\u2019s way of explicitly marking base class members as open for inheritance and derived class members as overrides avoids several kinds of common Java errors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, you\u0027ll learn how to create apps and run them on virtual devices through guided exercises. You\u0027ll cover the fundamentals of Android development, from structuring an app to building out the UI with Activities and Fragments and various navigation patterns. Progressing through the chapters and lectures, you\u0027ll delve into Android\u0027s RecyclerView to make the most of displaying lists of data and become comfortable with fetching data from a web service and handling images. You\u0027ll then learn about mapping, location services, and the permissions model before working with notifications and how to persist data. Moving on, you\u0027ll get to grips with testing, covering the full spectrum of the test pyramid. You\u0027ll also learn how AAC (Android Architecture Components) are used to cleanly structure your code and explore various architecture patterns and the benefits of dependency injection. \u003Cem\u003EThe core libraries of RxJava and Coroutines are covered for asynchronous programming\u003C/em\u003E. The focus then returns to the UI, demonstrating how to add motion and transitions when users interact with your apps. Towards the end, you\u0027ll build an interesting app to retrieve and display popular movies from a movie database, and then see how to publish your apps on Google Play. By the end of this course, you\u0027ll have the skills and confidence needed to build fully-fledged Android apps using Kotlin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre you trying to start a career in Android programming, but haven\u0027t found the right way in? Do you have a great idea for an app, but don\u0027t know how to make it a reality? Or maybe you\u0027re just frustrated that to learn Android, you must already know Kotlin. If so, then this course is for you\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen Android first arrived in 2008, it was a bit drab compared to the much more stylish iOS on the Apple iPhone/iPad. But, quite quickly, through a variety of handset offers that struck a chord with practical, price-conscious consumers, as well as those who are fashion-conscious and tech-savvy, Android user numbers exploded. For many, myself included, developing for Android is the most rewarding pastime and business, bar none. Quickly putting together a prototype of an idea, refining it, and then deciding to run with it and wire it up into a fully-fledged app, is such an exciting and rewarding process. Any programming can be fun \u2013 I have been programming all my life \u2013 but creating for Android is somehow extraordinarily rewarding..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKotlin is the most succinct language, and therefore is the least error-prone, \u003Cem\u003Ewhich is great for beginners\u003C/em\u003E. Kotlin is also the most fun language, mainly because the succinctness means you can get results faster and with less code. Google considers Kotlin an official (first-class) Android language. There are some other advantages to Kotlin that make it less error-prone and less likely to make mistakes that cause crashes. We will discover the details of these advantages as we proceed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKotlin is an object-oriented language. This means that it uses the concept of reusable programming objects. If this sounds like technical jargon, another analogy will help. Kotlin enables us and others (like the Android API development team) to write code that can be structured based on real-world things, and here is the important part \u2013 it can be reused.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"Ingl\u00E9s","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/kotlin-android-training-android-app-development/","imageUri":"https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4365954_c92d_4.jpg?secure=XP6TwyImAoc6mK9AI7XW9g%3D%3D%2C1642099177","duration":"28,5 horas","enrolledStudentsCount":"4.004 estudiantes","lastUpdated":"Fecha de la \u00FAltima actualizaci\u00F3n: 1/2022","targetAudiences":["Beginner Kotlin Developers"],"tags":["Desarrollo","Desarrollo m\u00F3vil","Desarrollo en Android"],"rating":{"count":12,"averageValue":"4.2"},"instructors":[{"name":"OCSALY - Online Computer Science Academy","url":"/user/online-academy-of-computer-science/","totalNumberOfStudents":16381,"totalNumberOfReviews":86,"averageRating":3.9199427500000006}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"OCSALYCOUPON","originalPrice":"12\u00A0480\u00A0\u20B9","discountedPrice":"8\u00A0112\u00A0\u20B9","expirationText":"5\u00A0heures","discountPercentage":35}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/network-programming-java-mastering-java-networking/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4381314,"title":"Network Programming Java - Mastering Java Networking","shortDescription":"Learn Java network programming by practical example applications\\You will develop ClientServer,GUI Chat and other apps","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENetworking \u003C/strong\u003Esupplements a lot of power to simple programs.

It produces the power that turns the wheels and electricity for lights and other systems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost automobiles are powered by an internal combustion engine. Fuel, usually gasoline or petrol, is burned with air to create gases that expand. A spark plug creates a spark that ignites the gas and makes it burn. This energy moves through cylinders in which pistons slide up and down. They are attached to rods that move a crankshaft. Normal car engines have four to six cylinders but there are also models with eight and sixteen cylinders. The turning movement is passed through the drivetrain to the drive wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe engine and all parts that carry power to the wheels are called the drivetrain. It includes the transmission, drive shaft, differential, the axles and the drive wheels that move the car. While most cars have drive wheels in the front, some have them in the back. Cars that need to drive over all kinds of ground have a four-wheel drive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe transmission controls the speed and torque. When a car travels at a normal speed on a flat road it does not need so much torque to keep it moving, but when you want to start a car from a hill the engine must produce more power. Gears control speed and power of the engine in different driving conditions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn cars with manual transmission you have to change gears by pressing down the clutch with your foot and moving a lever. Cars with automatic transmission change gears without control by the driver. Lower gears give the car more torque and speed. When the car moves faster the transmission shifts to higher gears.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe driveshaft carries the power to the axle which is connected to the wheels. It has several joints which make the axle and wheels moveable as the car drives on uneven and bumpy roads.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe differential is connected to the rear end of the driveshaft.
