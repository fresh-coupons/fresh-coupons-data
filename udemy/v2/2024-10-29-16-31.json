That means that most project managers are likely to use spreadsheet software such as LibreOffice Calc or Microsoft Excel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the main reasons that project managers do not use project management software is the lack of support from an organisation. Learning how to use spreadsheets to create effective management tools means that you will not have this problem.

This will provide you with an excellent visual presentation of your tasks, schedules, resources, and progress. Your team will easily be able to view the progress of the project and have no difficulties in understanding the information.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe course also provides additional tools that will complement the project tracker. The first tool is the plan. You will need to create a project plan before building the tracker. This will enable you to plan the tasks, deliverables, milestones, and outcomes of the project. From the plan, the project tracker can be developed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother essential tool is the project budget. You will learn how to create one. The project budget should be used to complement the project tracker. The project tracker focuses on the general management of schedules and resources.

There will be several tutorials included that will teach you about the jargon associated with project tracking such as deadlines, deliverables, milestones, and risk management.
