Whether you\u0027re a newcomer to IT governance or looking to refresh your knowledge, this course is the perfect starting point for your COBIT journey.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E1. Framework Introduction:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this section, the COBIT 2019 Foundation course introduces you to the COBIT framework. You\u0027ll gain an understanding of what COBIT is, its history, and its significance in the world of IT governance and management. This topic serves as the foundation for the course, establishing the context for the principles and concepts you\u0027ll be learning throughout the program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E2. Principles:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Principles of COBIT 2019 are a set of seven guiding principles that form the core of the framework. These principles provide a high-level, philosophical basis for the development and implementation of effective governance and management of enterprise IT. Understanding these principles is crucial because they guide how COBIT is designed and how it should be applied in real-world scenarios.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E3. Governance System and Components:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis topic delves into the governance system and its various components. You\u0027ll learn how the governance system operates and how it is structured. COBIT comprises four primary components: Principles, Policies, Practices, and Enablers. These components work in harmony to help organizations establish a robust IT governance system that aligns IT with business objectives and ensures effective risk management.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E4. Governance and Management Objectives:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGovernance and Management Objectives (GMOs) are the heart of COBIT 2019. GMOs are specific, actionable goals that organizations strive to achieve when implementing IT governance and management. These objectives are organized into various domains, covering key areas like Align, Plan, Build, Run, and Monitor. Understanding GMOs is essential for shaping your organization\u0027s IT strategy and achieving desired outcomes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E5. Performance Management:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerformance management is a vital aspect of the COBIT framework. This topic explains how to measure and evaluate the performance of your IT governance system. You\u0027ll learn about Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and Key Goal Indicators (KGIs) that help organizations track their progress and ensure they are meeting their governance and management objectives.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E6. Designing a Tailored Governance System:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrganizations differ in their size, industry, and objectives, so a one-size-fits-all approach to IT governance doesn\u0027t work. COBIT 2019 emphasizes the importance of designing a tailored governance system that aligns with an organization\u0027s unique requirements. This topic discusses how to customize COBIT to suit your organization\u0027s specific needs, ensuring the effective governance of IT resources.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E7.

One key aspect of this is managerial accounting, which provides valuable insights into an organization\u0027s internal operations and helps in optimizing performance. In this 101 course, we will delve into the fundamental concepts of Managerial Accounting and its integral component, Cost Accounting 101.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EManagerial Accounting: Managerial accounting, also known as management accounting, is the process of identifying, measuring, analyzing, interpreting, and communicating financial information to aid internal decision-making within an organization. Unlike financial accounting, which is focused on external reporting to stakeholders, managerial accounting is primarily concerned with providing information for internal use by managers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKey Concepts in Managerial Accounting:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. \u003Cstrong\u003ECost Behavior:\u003C/strong\u003E Understanding how costs behave is fundamental in managerial accounting. Costs can be classified as fixed, variable, or mixed. Fixed costs remain constant regardless of production levels, while variable costs fluctuate with production. Mixed costs have elements of both fixed and variable costs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. \u003Cstrong\u003ECost-Volume-Profit (CVP) Analysis:\u003C/strong\u003E CVP analysis helps managers understand the relationship between costs, sales volume, and profit.

It is suitable for industries that produce customized, unique products or services, such as construction and printing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. \u003Cstrong\u003EProcess Costing:\u003C/strong\u003E Process costing is used in industries with continuous production processes, such as chemical manufacturing or food processing. Costs are averaged over the total units produced during a specific period.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. \u003Cstrong\u003EActivity-Based Costing (ABC):\u003C/strong\u003E ABC assigns costs based on the activities that drive them, providing a more accurate picture of the resources consumed by different processes or products.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. \u003Cstrong\u003EStandard Costing:\u003C/strong\u003E Standard costing involves setting predetermined costs for direct materials, direct labor, and overhead. Deviations from these standards are analyzed to identify areas for improvement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA solid grasp of managerial accounting and cost accounting is indispensable for anyone navigating the complex world of business. The fundamental principles discussed in this course provide a strong foundation for making informed decisions, optimizing resources, and ultimately contributing to the overall success of an organization. As you embark on this journey of understanding managerial and cost accounting, remember that these tools are not just about numbers; they are about empowering managers to lead their organizations with insight and foresight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am going to teach 9 major topics !\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

I\u0027ve worked in radio/television as a producer/host and I\u0027ve been interviewed by national media outlets from Good Morning America to the New York Times, so I\u0027m picky; and I\u0027m typically critical of those I see out there passing themselves off as media training experts, especially since I do media training (on a much smaller scale) myself. TJ Walker is the real deal. Though the production values aren\u0027t high end and the lighting/background could use some tweaking, the content itself is top-notch.

Naturally, we are going to get started by setting up the right tools for our projects. And after that, we are going to build our first simple yet very interesting project and that\u0027s a URL shortening service. The second project will be about sending emails in PHP and that\u0027s very important because it\u0027s a feature that almost every website has. The next project will be the starting of something big because it\u0027s an authentication system where I am going to teach you how to develop a login and a register page, how to hash and de-hash passwords, how to do validation and so much more. After this, we are going to build a comments system and this will be the biggest project in this course. We will begin first by doing a post system and then we will grab comments for every post that we have of course we will use Ajax-JQuery for inserting, deleting, and showing comments. after that, we will integrate a rating system into the previous two projects to make a bigger project. So, I will show how to download a JQuery plugin, how to integrate it and how to use it to do the rating system for every post, and so on. And the rating system is going to be implemented of course using Ajax-JQuery. The upcoming project is going to be also created with Ajax and JQuery and that\u0027s a live search system and we will combine it with our big project. The last project will be about building a weather app. All we are going to do is set up a form, allow the user to enter a city, and then give him the current degree of this city. So we will use an API to grab the current degree for this city.
