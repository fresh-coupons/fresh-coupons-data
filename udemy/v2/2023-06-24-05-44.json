have been over 250 armed conflicts since the Charter was signed in 1946. Sustainable Development Goal 16: Promote Just, Peaceful, and Inclusive Societies, calls for all Member States to promote peaceful co-existence among people. Some of its primary targets include reducing arms flows and combatting organized crime, as well as significantly reducing all forms of violence worldwide.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday more than 600 million young people live in volatile and conflict-prone areas. Young people are disproportionately affected by the multiple and often interlinked forms of violence such as political violence, organized crime and terrorist attacks which exact human, social and economic costs. In the past decade, the recruitment of young people into violent and extremist groups has led some to view youth as a threat to global security and stability. However, research shows that the number of young people who actively participate in violence is a small minority, while the vast majority of youth are not prone to violence, despite the injustices, deprivations and abuse they can confront daily, particularly in conflict zones. Moreover, a growing body of evidence suggests that they can and do play active roles as agents of positive and constructive change, and the recently adopted Security Council Resolution 2250 on Youth, Peace and Security highlights this fact. It is a formal recognition of the positive role youth can play in the maintenance of international peace and security.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe maintenance of global peace and security is a cross cutting issue that is critical to achieving all the Sustainable Development Goals. Several UN offices are involved in the promotion and maintenance of international peace and security including: the Security Council, General Assembly, Secretary-General, Departments of Peacekeeping Operations, Field Support and Political Affairs and the Peacebuilding Support Office. Universities and institutions of higher learning are also important actors because they educate future leaders and peacemakers, who will shape the course of peace building in the world.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/peace-and-conflict-resolution/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4040440_6fd1.jpg","duration":"3.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"6,559.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Teachers","B.A","M.A","Working Professionals","Researchers","Laywers"],"tags":["Conflict Management"],"rating":{"count":21,"averageValue":"4.2"},"instructors":[{"name":"Dr. Swati Chakraborty","url":"/user/swati-chakraborty-5/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.1363635}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"PEACE_623","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"2 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/digital-dropshipping-masterkurs/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4090068,"title":"Digital Dropshipping: Das NEUE Gesch\u00E4ftsmodell","shortDescription":"#1 Digitaler Dropshipping Kurs: Die Schritt f\u00FCr Schritt Anleitung f\u00FCr den Verkauf \u0026 Vermarktung von DIGITALEN Produkten","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDu bist unprofitabel mit deinem Dropshipping Shop oder hast noch nicht einmal angefangen?

Afterward, you will also learn aspects that you need to concentrate on when it comes to creating effective chatbot conversation flows. Before getting into the projects, you will also be given several AI chatbot ideas that you can consider to create which are intended to give you some inspiration. Then, in the project session, you will be fully guided step by step on how to build an AI chatbot from scratch using Poe, AI Bot, Confer Bot, and Collect Chat. In total, we will be building and designing four different AI chatbots where we will create customer service support chatbot, travel assistant chatbot, personal finance assistant chatbot, and mental health support chatbot. Since the most effective way to learn is actually to learn by doing, hence, building all those AI chatbot projects will definitely give you experience to improve your skill sets and knowledge even more. Once the AI chatbots have been built, we will be conducting testing to make sure that they have been fully functioning and more importantly they have a user friendly interface. For the testing session, there will be four testing objectives and those are functional testing, performance testing, user experience testing, and integration testing. At the end of the course, you will also learn how to potentially monetise your expertise in building and designing AI chatbot by getting to know several business models that you should consider to start.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, we need to ask ourselves this question, why should we learn to build and design AI chatbots?
