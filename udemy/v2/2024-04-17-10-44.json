I found this course created by TJ Walker a perfect introduction to the world of media training. I wanted to learn, not only what a media trainer does, but also what steps I would have to take in order to become a successful media trainer--TJ discusses all this in a clear and concise manner, in a tone that is welcoming and never alienating. The only constructive critique I would give would be concerning the technical form of the presentation, more specifically the video quality and picture aesthetic. Going by the current standard as it applies to video, everything we view is in high definition. Having said that, I believe the video quality could be improved upon as well as the backdrop which I found to be a bit generic and outdated. I found these minor flaws to be slightly distracting and given the high caliber of the speaker and the information being presented I believe these aspects detracted, if only marginally, from the quality of the product.\u0022\u0026nbsp;\u003C/em\u003ENick Cisik\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u00225 Stars!

I wasn\u0027t sure about the course, but I thought I would try, and I am glad I did. I didn\u0027t like the way my podcast was going because I was saying, \u0022um\u0022 and using the word \u0022and\u0022 a lot. I also said \u0022you know\u0022 quite a bit. I was pretty good at editing, but I wanted to be better. This course helped me to understand that no one is perfect and how to improve on what I don\u0027t like about my delivery.
