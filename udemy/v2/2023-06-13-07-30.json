It\u2019s designed to sell your products or services while establishing a voice for your brand.

It assumes that you\u0027re new to the language, so it gets you started with basic functionality such as creating functions, creating variables, and calling these lines of code from your standard HTML pages. It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E*\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E javascript course contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript introduction\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript array\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript variables\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript functions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript objects\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript control statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript cookies\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript loop statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript data structures\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript error handling\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript regular expressions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003Esection 2- learn PHP\u0026nbsp;programming language\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis section will learn the basic structure of a web application and how a web browser interacts with a web server.

Products look better than ever, interfaces feel intuitive, and companies are hiring designers at an increasing rate. But, the designer\u2019s role has been changing over the last few years. It\u2019s no longer enough to iterate and understand your user, instead in today\u2019s world, designers should be able to do both \u2013 identify problems and build solutions, which will increase their worth by at least 10 times for any company.

First we will create our WordPress site on Local Hosting. Local Hosting is Different from Live Hosting and its Free of Cost. We will be learning about both these methods in details in this class but until then you can think of Local Hosting as a editable saved Draft. Generally in order to create a WordPress site and use all the features of WordPress we first need to buy a domain and web hosting plan. But when it comes to Local Hosting we get access to all the features of WordPress free of cost without any Limitations. And once our site is fully customized we can simply transfer the Entire site to a Live Domain and Live Hosting. This Method of creating and customizing the site on local hosting first and then exporting the site to Live Hosting will save us lots of time, efforts and money. Also like I mentioned previously we will get our Live Domain and Live Hosting Service using a Free Method.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this class we will not only learn how to create an Ecommerce Site on WordPress but we will also learn different settings and Features of WordPress that will help you to manage or create any type of WordPress site in the Future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELet us talk about some of the main contents of this Class:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E#1 WooCommerce Plugin\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWooCommerce is an open-source e-commerce plugin for WordPress. It is designed for small to large-sized online merchants using WordPress. If you want to create any Ecommerce site then the most important thing you need to create is your online product store. With the help of WooCommerce plugin we can easily create our Product Store without use of any Coding. In this class we will be learning about the WooCommerce Plugin in details.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E#2 Elementor\u003C/strong\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003EWebsite Builder\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EElementor is a Website Builder Plugin that has a simple Drag and Drop Feature that will help us customize our Pages and Posts with many amazing features that normally would not have been possible without using coding. In this Class we will Learn about the Elementor Plugin and its features in details and use it to customize several pages and posts on our site including our Home Page.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E#3 Plugins in WordPress\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow the WooCommerce and Elementor Website Builder are not the default features of a WordPress site but they are a Plugin. A Plugin is a piece of software that adds new features or extends functionality on an existing application. And just like these two plugins we will be using several other plugins in order to add various features on our WordPress site and make it a Fully Functional Ecommerce site. And once again we will be using the Plugins that are absolutely free.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E#4 Theme Customization Options\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEvery WordPress site as a theme which you can say is a default template or the canvas of the site on which we carry out the customization. Now there are thousands of themes available on WordPress that you can choose from and every theme has some unique features of its own. In this class we will install a theme whose features are more suitable and compatible for an Ecommerce site. Also there are lots of areas of a WordPress themes that need to be customized like the Sidebar, Footer, Posts Page, Home Page among others. So in this class we will be learning about the Theme Customization options in details that can help you customize any theme in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E#5 Responsive Settings\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA Responsive site is a site that is accessible across all the devices such as mobile, Desktop, Tablets etc. Also all the designs and Features of the Responsive site should be compatible with all the devices since all these devices have different screen Dimensions. So its important to learn about the Responsive Settings so we can ensure that the users across all the devices who visit our site have a smooth Experience. In this class we will carry out the Responsive Testing and make sure our site runs smooth across all the Devices.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E#5 Payment Gateway Integration\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to make Money from your Ecommerce store then the first thing that you need is a Payment Gateway. A Payment Gateway is how the customers pay for the products and the money is received in your bank account. Now there are lots of Payment Methods such as Direct Bank Transfer, Cash on Delivery, PayPal, Venmo etc. So we will Learn how we can add all these Payment Methods to our Ecommerce site and I will also carry out some Test Purchase.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E#6 Order Processing\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce a customer places an order on our site we need to process the order. We need to check if the Payment is successful or if the shipping address is correct etc. And if everything is fine then we need to ship the product and notify the customer. If the product is virtual we can complete the order and instantly send the product to the customer. So in this class we will learn the entire process of order processing by carrying out few mock purchases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E#7 Backup and Restore\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the most Important things you should remember while running an Ecommerce Business is to regularly create a backup for your site. There can be some unfortunate errors such as database error, system error, server error etc. And because of such error your entire site can reset back to default or some major contents may go missing. In such situations having a backup can save all your efforts. Once you have the backup of your Site you can easily Restore your site anytime very easy with just few clicks. In this class we will install a plugin to create a Backup for our WordPress site and also carry out the Recovery Process. The Backup and Restore works across both the Live sites as well as the Local Sites.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E#8 Live Domain, Live Hosting and Migration of WordPress Site\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce we have successfully created a fully Functional Ecommerce Site on Locally Hosted WordPress its time for us to migrate or transfer the entire site to a Live Domain and Live Hosting service so that the World can access it on the Internet. In order to make this happen we first need to create a website with Live Domain and Live Hosting and install WordPress on it. Once we have a WordPress site with a Live Domain and Live Hosting we can simply import the Backup of our Local Site thus transferring all the database and files from our fully customized local site to this newly created live WordPress site. And like i Promised throughout this class you won\u0027t have to spend a single dollar cause I\u0027ll show you a method to get Live Domain and Live Hosting free of cost. Although if you want to create a Professional Ecommerce site it is recommended you buy a Premium Domain and Hosting. But since here our primary objective is to Learn and Practice we will use the free method which is just as good as the Premium method although it has some limitations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESo I hope you got an Idea of how the class will proceed.

To run a business at optimal capacity, you need to reduce or eliminate waste from processes and improve production flow. In this course, you\u0027ll learn about Lean strategies to reduce waste by determining which operations add value and which don\u0027t. You\u0027ll explore the concept of continuous flow, and discover how to balance work processes to make production flow more efficient. You\u0027ll define what waste is, where it exists, and what causes it.

And in any business, one of the heaviest drains on profitability is waste. Lean waste can come in the form of time, material, and labor. But it may also be related to the utilization of skill-sets as well as poor planning. In lean manufacturing, waste is any expense or effort that is expended but which does not transform raw materials into an item the customer is willing to pay for. By optimizing process steps and eliminating waste, the only true value is added at each phase of production.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday, the Lean Manufacturing model recognizes 8 types of waste within an operation; seven originally conceived when the Toyota Production System was first conceived, and an eighth added when the lean methodology was adopted within the Western World.

SQL injection is one of the most common web hacking techniques. SQL injection is the placement of malicious code in SQL statements, via web page input.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E SQL injection attack consists of insertion or \u201Cinjection\u201D of a SQL query via the input data from the client to the application. A successful SQL injection exploit can read sensitive data from the database, modify database data (Insert/Update/Delete), execute administration operations on the database (such as shutdown the DBMS), recover the content of a given file present on the DBMS file system and in some cases issue commands to the operating system. SQL injection attacks are a type of injection attack, in which SQL commands are injected into data-plane input in order to affect the execution of predefined SQL commands.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESQL injection attacks allow attackers to spoof identity, tamper with existing data, cause repudiation issues such as voiding transactions or changing balances, allow the complete disclosure of all data on the system, destroy the data or make it otherwise unavailable, and become administrators of the database server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESQL Injection is very common with PHP and ASP applications due to the prevalence of older functional interfaces.
