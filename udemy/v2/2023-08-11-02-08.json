or system of measuring and improving performance within an organization is performance management. Typically, performance management is used to monitor individual performance, but it can also be used to monitor performance at an organizational and departmental level. There are a few common elements to a performance management system:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA performance review, a manager-to-manager meeting, peer feedback, a performance improvement program, goal-setting, tracking, rewards and recognition\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETypically, managers track and develop their team members\u0027 performance and then report to their higher leadership team. Employees used to get annual performance reviews as part of the performance management process. In recent years, research has shown that frequent feedback is more effective than annual reviews, so many companies have dropped the annual review model for regular manager check-ins and informal feedback sessions. By making small adjustments over time instead of trying to make one big course correction at the end of the year, this type of performance management can help employees understand and align with company goals and objectives.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this master course I would like to teach the 5 major topics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

It talks and explains the networking basics which is much more helpful for the beginners who are new to the world and domain of networking. This OSPF Certification course of Routing Protocol OSPF builds a strong foundation for them to prepare for good level certifications like CCNA. You will be able to learn all the terminologies and key functionalities related to routing protocols. There is n number of routing protocols that are developed today but only very few have been adopted by the industry. In this course, all those concepts will be explained in detail and you can practice them at your ease. The broad areas to be covered are related to configurations, operations, and troubleshooting. Apart from that, there are a few use cases of two very popular Routing protocols that work on the principle of OSPF and have their level of advantages. This OSPF Certification Module describes how to connect and configure and operate Open Shortest Path First which was specifically designed for IP networks and therefore supports IP tagging and sub-netting of extremely derived information related to routing. It also allows the packet-based information and authentication to take place and also makes use of the multicast for Internet protocol when either sending or receiving any packet\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis course module named Routing Protocols RIP and EIGRP is quite similar to the one used above and is also responsible to teach you many basics and fundamental concepts such as those related to troubleshooting, operation, and configuration. The two most important routing protocols which will be explained in detail are the RIP also known as Routing information protocol and the other is EIGRP which is the abbreviated form for Extended interior Gateway protocol. In the RIP protocol, the oldest of the vectors for distance IP Routing protocols are still put to use and thereby getting various enhancements. There are currently two versions that exist for the RIP viz. RIPv1 and RIPv2. RIPv1 is also said to be the classful protocol which means that it is not classless whereas if you talk about the RIPv2, it is considered to be the classless support routing protocol and IPv6 is the one whose support is extended to RIPv2 with the next-gen RIP which is also termed as RIPng. EIGRP, on the other hand, is related to the Interior Gateway protocol as it is a proprietary protocol of the company CISCO. This protocol is occasionally described as the distance vector routing protocol which also acts and imitates like a link state-oriented protocol. Distance vector-based protocols share everything of which they are aware of. The only limitation they carry is that the amount of information shared is only among the neighbors which are directly or indirectly connected with each other. Link state-based protocols announce that the information present is only about the direction and not indirectly connected links. However, they are also responsible to share the routing protocol information among themselves in all the areas they deem fit among all the routes in their domain or area.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/cisco-ospf-hands-on-certification-training/","imageUri":"https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4844382_3644_3.jpg","duration":"10.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"4,096.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["The target audience for this course is anybody who has a keen interest in the field of digital communication and is also aware of how the basics of understanding the networks and other routing protocols and mechanisms such as OSPF Routing.

Two fundamental principles of Islamic banking are the sharing of profit and loss and the prohibition of the collection and payment of interest by lenders and investors. In Islamic banking, the banks do not collect interests from creditors. Instead, they earn money using equity participation systems and share profits and losses. Islamic finance is practiced in many Muslim countries and is extremely popular among Islamic communities, as some conventional banking practices might be against Shariah. Islamic finance is considered more ethical than conventional banking, as it believes that a bank and its clients should make profits and losses together. Hence, it does not just focus on maximizing the bank\u2019s wealth. Also, Islamic finance practices consider the best interests of the Muslim community.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIslamic banking development can be attributed to some conventional banking theories and practices which go against and hurt the sentiments of the Muslim communities. Hence, Islamic finance was developed by inventing methods that are Sharia-compliant. Sharia is the Islamic law present in the Quran\u2019s teachings. Creating practices that align with the Muslim culture and beliefs encourages many to take up banking. Islamic finance is so strictly followed that banks look to religious leaders and scholars for guidance. The main objective of Islamic banking\u003Cstrong\u003E \u003C/strong\u003Eand finance is that all society participants should create wealth and benefit.

This is basically an extensive project based course where you will be guided step by step on how to build a cryptocurrency price tracking website using Wordpress alongside with Cryptocurrency Widgets plugin which is a Wordpress plugin that was specifically designed to create cryptocurrency market price tracker just like Coinmarketcap and Coingecko. In addition, Cryptocurrency Widgets plugin is also supported by CoinGecko API, therefore, the price data that will be displayed on the Wordpress website will be reliable and most up to date data. In the introduction session, you will learn the basic fundamentals of Wordpress and get to know more about Cryptocurrency Widgets which is the plugin that will be utilised in this project. Then, you will also get to know the general overview of the project that we are going to build as well as all features that will be included. Before getting to the main section of the course, you will be guided step by step on how to set up all necessary tools like creating an account on Taste WP which is Wordpress testing platform that we are going to use and also installing the plugin that we need for this project. Once we are ready, you will learn step by step on how to build the crypto price tracker website from scratch, we will go over how to import the price columns and how to change the currency. After the website has been built, we are going to be conducting testing to make sure that the crypto price tracking website has been fully functioning and also easy to use from the user\u2019s perspective. There will be four main testing objectives that will be emphasised in this course, those are functionality testing, user experience testing, compatibility testing, and performance testing. Once the website has been tested and passed all the required criteria, you are going to get to know more about affordable domain and hosting options. Hopefully, this particular section will enable you to make informed decisions about which hosting service you want to use. At the end of the course, you will also learn how to monetise your cryptocurrency price tracking website, we will go over several strategies such as displaying ads, premium ICO, and subscription based model.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, before getting into the course, we need to ask ourselves this question: why should we learn or even build a cryptocurrency price tracking website? Well, there are many answers to that question but in my opinion, cryptocurrency, web 3.0, and blockchain have been growing very rapidly in the past few years, hence, the demand for crypto tracking websites will always be there. If you were thinking about creating the exact clone of Coinmarketcap or Coingecko, then most likely, it will not work since they have already dominated the market a long time even before you started however if you have new creative ideas and try to combine those innovations with crypto price tracker system in your website, I am pretty sure you have a good chance to succeed. Besides crypto, learning how to build and design websites using Wordpress is also a high demand skill to have in today\u2019s market as more and more companies are transforming toward massive scale digitalisation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow are things that you can expect to learn from the course:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearning the basic fundamentals of Wordpress \u0026amp; Cryptocurrency Widgets plugin\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearning how to build Wordpress website using TasteWP\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearning how to create a fully animated cryptocurrency price ticker on Wordpress\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearning how to add cryptocurrency price list with detailed information, such as market cap, supply, transaction volume, etc\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearning how to add multi-currency tabs on Wordpress\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConducting testing on the website with four main testing objectives, those are functionality testing, user experience testing, performance testing, and compatibility testing\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGetting to know more about affordable domain \u0026amp; hosting provider options\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearning how to integrate ads to Wordpress website\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearning how to monetise cryptocurrency price tracking website\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/building-cryptocurrency-price-tracker-website-with-wordpress/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5484248_8459.jpg","duration":"2 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"1,242.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["People who are interested in building cryptocurrency price tracking website","People who are interested in building \u0026 designing Wordpress website"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":0,"averageValue":"0.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"Christ Raharja","url":"/user/christ-raharja/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":0}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"945FC8A4F7FA50B7F8F7","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"\u20B9449","expirationText":"5 hours","discountPercentage":44}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/web-development-beginners-to-advanced/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5018456,"title":"Web Design Course for Beginners to Intermediate","shortDescription":"Learn the Basics of HTML, CSS, Wordpress and get Started with Web Design","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EHello Everyone, Welcome to the Web Design Course for Beginners to Intermediate.
