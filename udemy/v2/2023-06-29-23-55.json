Here we will explore important concepts such as catalog settings, import file handling, auto renaming, metadata presets, and import preferences. Once students are familiar with the basics, we take a theoretical dive into a number of concepts and key terms that are essential in the photography and digital image editing arena. Here we will explore various file formats, color spaces, image resolution, pixel density, and much more. From there, we transition back to completing application setup by exploring file handling options, interface preferences, identity plate setup, and watermarking with both text and graphics.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOnce we\u2019ve covered the foundations, students will take a deep dive into the Lightroom Library Module.

This section starts from the basics, where we explore the Library interface. From there, students learn to filter files, paint keywords, and generate keyword sets. We\u2019ll also demonstrate how to use various library views for image comparison, and advanced sorting. Once students have a handle of the foundations, we cover more intermediate sorting techniques using star ratings, pick and reject flags, color labels, and smart collections.

This course covers an extensive amount of material and by the end you will be proficient enough with AWS to gain an entry level position in cloud administration.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe curriculum starts off with exploring AWS account registration, billing and multi-factor authentication. We then explore more advanced account security through AWS identity and access management (IAM). IAM is an integral part of AWS that facilitates the management of users, groups, and security policies that control AWS resources. Here, we explore the creation of IAM users with varying degrees of account access. This includes user groups, permission policies, and IAM roles for EC2.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOnce students have a firm understanding of IAM, we dive into the backbone of AWS by exploring EC2 instance deployment and configuration. EC2 is a core service of AWS that facilitates the launch of virtual servers (called instances) within the AWS cloud console. We cover how to launch and configure EC2 instances, including choosing the right instance type and setting up security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic. We also explore remote instance administration using PuTTY and Terminal to issue server commands and manage instances from any remote location. Students learn to deploy and assign elastic IP addresses along with the creation of Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) to save instance state and quickly launch new instances with replicated configurations.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAfter completion of the EC2 module, we jump into AWS storage solutions where we explore various storage types including, block, file and object storage. More specifically students learn to harness the power of the Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) and the Amazon Elastic File System (EFS). We demonstrate how to deploy and configure multiple EBS volumes and attach them to existing instances for maximum scalability. Students also learn to design and deploy seamlessly scalable storage systems using EFS. We demonstrate how to mount multiple instances to a single EFS endpoint for centralized access to data files. We complete the module by showcasing the power of EBS snapshots and Amazon Machine Images for efficient instance deployment and backups.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EFrom this point, the course branches into more intermediate concepts by exploring elastic load balancing (ELB), Auto Scaling Groups (ASG), and Route 53. Student will learn to deploy a highly available architecture that auto scales based on real-time traffic workload and instance health checks. Traffic will be routed directly through Amazons Route 53 DNS service, with customized domain names and pre-configured hosted zones.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EBy the end of this course, you will have a solid understanding of how to use AWS to build and deploy your own cloud-based infrastructure.

This course contains modules that educate the human resource professional on career development opportunities for the employees and helps them to design the progress framework.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe real asset of a company is not its infrastructure nor it is the profits, it is its employees who work wholeheartedly for the company. The companies, who understand this thing well, never get into higher losses. So the essence is that every company should try to make its employees happy all the while. Now if we talk about the performance part of the employees, so it also matters a lot for the company and yes it is not exaggerated to say that employees should also feel the responsibility of work. So to make employees motivated toward work there is a concept of \u201Cperformance appraisal\u201D in every company which is basically the allowance, paid to the employee whose performance is excellent in every assignment provided to him.

The course focusses on different strategies for retaining the performing employees who are a valuable gem to the company.

Retention methods are very effective in creating a positive impact among the employees and thus helps to increase the turnover of the company.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this ever-changing work environment, employee turnover is a best-oriented move that could see fresh faces, fresh ideas, and experience beaming all through the work environment.

Business Manager differs from Ads Manager because it allows you to oversee campaigns and assets for all of the businesses you work with, not just a singular business. With this Meta platform, you can run your ads, measure your ad performance, manage assets such as your Pages, data sources and ad accounts, as well as add an agency or marketing partner to help you manage your business. To help you securely manage your business assets (your business content), Business Manager allows you to grant permissions to collaborators. There are two types of permissions you can grant someone, People or Partner, which should then allow you to assign the appropriate level of access based on the person\u0027s role in your business.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhen You Enrol, You Also Get:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECourse Materials \u0026amp; Tuition Worth at least $1.080 - you get it all - for a tiny fraction of the cost!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHandy PDF \u0026amp; MP3 packed with useful and extra resources you can download from our Resource Centre\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInteractive Quizzes \u0026amp; Copywriting assignments\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELifetime access \u0026amp; Lifetime updates\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUdemy certificate of completion - ready for download\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E30-day money back guarantee\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFast \u0026amp; friendly support in the Q\u0026amp;A section - ask me a question anytime\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPDF 10 lessons to quit your job and become a digital nomad\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPDF 10 reasons to become a digital nomad today\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPDF Digital Nomad Secrets\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPDF Starter pack for digital nomads\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPDF 157 questions that will help you raise your prices dramatically\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPDF Ebook-Side Hustle Secrets\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPDF Create a photography landing page that turns visitors in to clients\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPDF Find photography clients before travelling to your next destination\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPDF Presentation template: Attracting high value clients whilst travelling\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPDF Pricing Strategies and Adding Value\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWe Look Forward To Welcoming You On Board As Our Newest Student\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYours\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIng.

It is based on the idea that a neural network can learn to automatically learn representations of the data at different levels of abstraction. Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) is a type of deep learning model that is a feedforward artificial neural network model that maps sets of input data onto a set of appropriate outputs. MLP is a supervised learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. MLP is based on the idea that a neural network with multiple layers can learn to automatically learn representations of the data at different levels of abstraction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENatural Language Processing (NLP): \u003C/strong\u003ENatural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of Artificial Intelligence that deals with the interaction between human language and computers. One of the common techniques used in NLP is the term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf). Tf-idf is a statistical measure that reflects the importance of a word in a document or a corpus of documents.

By the end of the course, students will have the skills necessary to build a fully customizable e-commerce site on an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance. The entire infrastructure will be highly available and scalable using Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs) and Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs). \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe course begins by introducing students to AWS and the various services it offers. This includes a brief overview of the AWS management console and how to navigate it. From there, we delve deeper into the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) service. EC2 will serve as the backbone of the e-commerce site we build using React.JS. Students will learn how to launch and configure EC2 instances, as well as how to connect to them securely using remote connection utilities like PuTTY and Terminal. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ENext, we will cover AWS Storage, including Elastic Block Store (EBS) and Elastic File System (EFS). Here, students learn to create and manage storage volumes, and how to securely connect them to EC2 instances. We also explore the different types of storage available on AWS and when to use each one.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAfter covering the basics, students learn to create Elastic Load Balancers and integrate them with Auto Scaling Groups for workload distribution. Here, we demonstrate how to create a highly available and scalable infrastructure for the e-commerce site which will be built in the last section of the course. The infrastructure will automatically scale based on traffic and overall load. Traffic will only be distributed to healthy nodes in the network, based on parameters that are established during configuration. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EFinally, students learn how to build a fully customizable e-commerce site using React.js. Here, students will create and manage a React project, as well as effectively use React components to build a dynamic user interface. We also explore how to integrate the e-commerce site with other AWS services such as AWS storage, to efficiently scale capacity based on application requirements.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThroughout the course, students will work on hands-on projects to apply the concepts they have learned. These projects include building a simple e-commerce site to start and scaling up to a more complex site with advanced features such as product search, and product categories.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EBy the end of the course, students will have a solid understanding of the basics of AWS and React.js. Students will be able to build a fully functional and customizable e-commerce site on an EC2 instance. This includes having the knowledge and skills necessary to continue learning more advanced AWS and React.js concepts and being able to build out new projects independently.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThis course is designed for developers and IT professionals who want to learn how to build scalable and highly available applications on AWS using React.js.
