The goal is for the model to learn a mapping function that can predict the output for unseen inputs accurately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eb) Unsupervised Learning: Unlike supervised learning, unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data. The algorithm\u0027s objective is to find patterns and structures in the data without explicit guidance. Clustering and dimensionality reduction are typical tasks in unsupervised learning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ec) Reinforcement Learning: This type of learning is inspired by behavioral psychology, where an agent interacts with an environment and learns to take actions that maximize rewards or minimize penalties.

Good features can significantly impact the model\u0027s performance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ed) Model Selection: Choosing an appropriate algorithm or model architecture for the task at hand is essential. The choice of model depends on the problem type (classification, regression, etc.) and the nature of the data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ee) Model Training: In this step, the model is exposed to the training data to learn the underlying patterns and relationships. The algorithm adjusts its parameters to minimize the prediction errors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ef) Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model\u0027s performance on a separate set of data (validation or test set) is essential to ensure it generalizes well to unseen data and avoids overfitting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eg) Model Deployment: After a successful evaluation, the model can be deployed in a real-world setting to make predictions or decisions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEvaluation Metrics\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo assess the performance of a machine learning model, various evaluation metrics are used, depending on the type of problem.
