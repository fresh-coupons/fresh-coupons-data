This foundational knowledge is crucial for anyone looking to navigate complex strategic environments, whether in business, economics, or international relations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EA key focus of the course is on the core concepts of Game Theory, including players, strategies, and payoffs. You will learn how to identify the key players in a game, determine their available strategies, and analyze the potential payoffs for each strategic decision. This section will provide you with the tools to model and solve strategic problems, enabling you to predict and influence outcomes in various competitive scenarios.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe course also delves into the different types of games, distinguishing between cooperative and non-cooperative games. You will explore how collaboration and competition can shape the outcomes of strategic interactions, and how to determine when cooperation might lead to better results for all players involved. Understanding these distinctions is vital for analyzing real-world situations where collaboration or competition can significantly impact the success of strategies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe applications of Game Theory in economics are another critical component of the course. You will study the concept of Nash Equilibrium, one of the most important ideas in Game Theory, and learn how it can be used to predict the behavior of players in competitive environments. This section will help you understand how equilibrium is reached in strategic situations and how it can be applied to analyze market dynamics, pricing strategies, and competitive behavior in various industries.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThroughout the course, you will also explore examples of strategic decision-making, providing theoretical insights into how Game Theory is applied in real-world economic scenarios. From analyzing oligopolistic markets to understanding the strategic interactions in auctions, wage negotiations, public goods, and trade policies, this course will equip you with the skills to apply Game Theory to a wide range of economic and business challenges.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EBy the end of the course, you will have a deep understanding of Game Theory and its applications, enabling you to analyze and influence strategic interactions in both competitive and cooperative environments. This course is ideal for students, professionals, and anyone interested in mastering the art of strategic decision-making and applying game-theoretic principles to achieve successful outcomes in complex situations.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/strategic-decision-making-in-economics-game-theory/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/6119143_eabb.jpg","duration":"2 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"1,648.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Aspiring economists looking to deepen their understanding of strategic decision-making","Business leaders seeking to sharpen their strategic acumen and competitive edge","Policy-makers aiming to craft effective and informed economic strategies","Finance professionals wanting to apply game theory in investment decisions","Students studying economics or business desiring practical and theoretical insights","Analysts interested in understanding and predicting organizational behavior","Professionals involved in international trade negotiations and economic policy","Individuals with a keen interest in economics and strategy seeking advanced knowledge"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":3,"averageValue":"5.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"YouAccel Training","url":"/user/youaccel/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":5}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"OCT082024GOODIES","originalPrice":"\u20B91,799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/google-sheets-masterclass-the-power-of-excel-and-analysis/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5376074,"title":"Google Sheets Masterclass: The Power of Excel and Analysis","shortDescription":"Unleash the Power of Google Sheets: Master Data Analysis, Visualization, and Collaboration","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EUnlock the full potential of \u003Cstrong\u003EGoogle Sheets\u003C/strong\u003E with our comprehensive Google Sheets Masterclass.
