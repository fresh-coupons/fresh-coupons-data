It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables.

One such module is the Python collections module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe collections module is used to improve the functionalities of the built-in collection containers. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next section walks you through how to package a simple Python project. It will show you how to add the necessary files and structure to create the package, how to build the package, and how to use this Package.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the next section, you\u2019ll master all about math and statistics modules practically, and the functions that are used with them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimply, the math module provides access to the mathematical functions defined by the C standard. and The statistics module provides functions for calculating mathematical statistics of numeric data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, In the last part of this course you will learn something very important, which is decoration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this section on decorators, we\u2019ll look at what they are and how to create and use them in detail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimply and By definition, a decorator is a function that takes another function and extends the behavior of the latter function without explicitly modifying it. that\u2019s it .
