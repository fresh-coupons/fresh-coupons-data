This course teaches students how to create modern, interactive web pages using the Bootstrap framework and React JavaScript library. The course starts with an introduction into Bootstrap with a focus on its reputation in the development community as the number one choice for mobile-first front-end web frameworks. Bootstrap is a well documented collection of reusable code written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We start with exploring the foundations of Bootstrap, including embedding it into projects, and building out the basic Bootstrap page structure. From there we catapult into the infamous Bootstrap grid system, along with the commonly used three column web page layout. After the introductory topics, students learn to work with a number of components from typography, tables and image styling right up to wells, alerts, and buttons. As part of the course we demonstrate how to build out intricate navigation menus using dropdown, collapse, accordion, and pill menus. We will also cover form styling, carousels, modals, scrollspy and just about every other Bootstrap component that\u2019s instrumental to your journey as a front-end developer. The module concludes with a hands-on project, where students will use a Bootstrap theme to build a stunning web page from scratch.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn the second section of the course, we explore React. React, also known as React JS, is a powerful JavaScript library used for building custom, interactive user interfaces using UI components. Similar to Bootstrap, React is a well documented free and open source library. The project was founded by Meta and a network of independent developers. In this section, students learn how to use the React library through a series of hands-on projects. The React section of this course starts off with a hands-on project where you\u2019ll learn how to work with functional React components, props, Callback functions, OnClick Events, and the React State hook to build a fully functional calculator. From there we will dive into project number two, where you will build a connect-4 clone. Here we will cover more intermediate concepts including passing props, destructuring, passing arguments to click events, various styling methods, and handling callbacks. You will also learn about the React key property, React lifecycle events, and conditional rendering. By the end you will have built a complete multi and single player connect-4 game board with built-in AI capabilities. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn the final section of the course we further unleash the power of React by building out a complete e-commerce site with multiple product categories, a product showcase, shopping cart feature, and much more. Here, we introduce a number of integral new concepts including: JSON server, Fetch API, and installing React router. These essential building blocks will be used to render the product categories, style the product list, and configure the product details page. From there we dive into styled components, refactoring the shop layout, and exploring the concept of \u201Ccontext\u201D in React. In the final stages of the project students will configure the shopping cart basket, and the checkout feature. We will also implement a product search feature, followed by in-depth exercises on validating input forms in React.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAs you can see this course covers a tremendous bit of ground. Best of all it features Tim Maclachlan - a renowned senior full-stack developer with over 20 years of commercial development experience.

It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables.

And now they are starting to us\u0443 it to talk to businesses. To chat with an online store, with a bank, medical clinic - with any organization out there.","All of these companies need employees or contractors who understand how to make this shift, this transition. New channels on the one hand bring a lot of new possibilities, such as chatbots and artificial intelligence, and on the other hand, require a rebuilding of current business workflows.  For example agent\u2019s KPI in a contact centre based on whatsapp, is very different from a voice-based CC. And somebody need to know how to deal with it.  But the contact center is not the only place where apps like whatsapp are taking over. It affects pretty much every customer related departpent: sales, marketing and loyalty, support, customer experience, automation and online services.  So, Whether you plan to tie your career or business entirely to this feild, this knowledge will help you achieve your professional goals in a variety of ways. Because communication - is the essential part of business.  I started this journey seven years ago, when it was hardly even existed. Since then, I have worked with some of the world\u0027s biggest clients, such as Societe Generale, British american tobacco and others. Now I\u2019m a founder of a startup called brandy. im  I invite you to my course where you will learn the basics about communications of the future. Welcome!","Before we start I want to give a quick intro of myself and also let\u2019s take a look on the course plan.  So without further ado, here is what we will discuss  The course consists of 2 parts:  In a first one, everything down lesson 4, we are talking about the key benefits for business in general.  And then learning the basics of chatbots and AI.  The second part is becoming more specific.  We will see how exactly it implies to different departments. Discuss business application of particular messaging channels.  And with all of that we are getting ready to meet the main framework \u2013  of ideal customer journey in modern channels. Which will be useful tool to any of your further projects.  And briefly about me.  You can call me Slava. For a last 7 years I\u2019ve been running chat platform startup. For these years we made a lot of stuff, worked with some worldwide clients.  We have become official provider of apple messages for business. Not sure if this is my most significant achievement, but personally, the most pleasant one. A chance to work directly with apple team is really cool  and I have been honoured to become one of the business experts at the Retail banking school, where we are right now.  Feel free to connect or ask me anything on linkedin.  And, let\u2019s jump in!  So I hope this online course will be a good start on mastering this new world of digital communications and happier customers"],"tags":["Sales Management"],"rating":{"count":153,"averageValue":"4.2"},"instructors":[{"name":"MTF Institute of Management, Technology and Finance","url":"/user/mtfinstitute/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.2045455}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"A4E2BC7999FF5068DE83","originalPrice":"\u20B91,499","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"3 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/master-in-python-language-quickly-using-the-chatgpt-open-ai/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5126146,"title":"Master in Python Language Quickly Using the ChatGPT Open AI","shortDescription":"Accelerate Your Career with the Power of Python and By applying Chat GPT Open AI techniques for real-world Examples","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EThis course is designed to help beginners master the fundamentals of \u003Cstrong\u003EPython programming\u003C/strong\u003E.

React, also known as React JS, is a powerful JavaScript library used for building custom, interactive user interfaces using UI components. Some of the most well known examples of organizations using React for their front-end include Netflix, Facebook, and Airbnb. Developed and maintained by Meta along with a community of independent developers, React remains free and open-source. React is a component based library built entirely on JavaScript, which makes it perfect for designing complex UI\u2019s. With React, developers can build encapsulated components that efficiently manage their own state and render UI updates specifically when data changes. For example, think of the automated content refresh feature you see on a twitter feed, or facebook like button. Here the state of the UI component changes on the page, without having to manually refresh when the data is updated. This is just one small, yet powerful feature of React.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThrough a complete hands-on project, this course will teach you all the fundamental principles of React that you must know to become a proficient React developer. We start right from the basics, including the tools needed to get started. From there we dive into JSX, functional components, props, callbacks, and various OnClick events. By this stage, the calculator will have a complete visual display, coupled with functional arithmetic operations. Students then move on to passing parameters in Callback functions, using the React State Hook, and debugging.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn addition to the hands-on React module, we also offer a comprehensive overview of JavaScript for those who need a refresher. Here we start with introducing students to the document object model (DOM) which defines the logical structure of HTML documents. From there we dive into JavaScript to demonstrate various methods in which DOM elements can be manipulated to add interactivity to static components. We start right from the basics, which includes JavaScript placement, and data output. From there we move on to variable declaration, arithmetic operations, operator precedence, data types, and objects. Once the foundations are covered, we move on to more complex operations using Arrays, Conditional Statements, JavaScript comparison operators, booleans and loops. Here students will learn to unleash the true power of JavaScript to render different outcomes based on user interaction. We will explore the use of functions to efficiently handle repetitive tasks and JavaScript events to handle output based on actions and occurrences. The section will conclude with a hands-on project where students will implement their knowledge to build a web based photo gallery and background color changer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/build-a-custom-e-commerce-site-in-react-javascript-basics/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4789922_401f.jpg","duration":"7 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"51,745.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Students interested in learning the Foundations of JavaScript","Students interested in learning the Foundations of ReactJS Library","Students interested in Building Interactive UI Components using React","Students interested in learning how to build a fully customized E-Commerce Site in React"],"tags":["JavaScript","React JS"],"rating":{"count":256,"averageValue":"4.5"},"instructors":[{"name":"YouAccel Training","url":"/user/youaccel/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.413793}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"YOUACCEL22721","originalPrice":"\u20B91,999","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"1 day","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-sql-from-scratch-bootcamp/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":2934786,"title":"SQL Masterclass: SQL for Data Analysis","shortDescription":"Learn PostgreSQL for Data Science, Analysis and Reports, Start from the scratch and reach all the way!","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EAre you looking to enhance your database management skills and unlock the full potential of PostgreSQL, one of the most powerful open-source relational database systems?
