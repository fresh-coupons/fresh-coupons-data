Capital, or financing, is needed for the capital investments. A company could generate the capital from internal operations, but often looks for other sources of financing to facilitate faster growth and quicker revenue generation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe options to acquire capital include debt financing and equity financing. As a company thinks about their financing options, they should have an understanding of their financing structure. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is often used for financing decisions. This course will demonstrate the WACC calculation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearners will understand how to calculate the cost of debt. One of the primary forms of debt financing are corporate bonds, the cost including interest payments on the bonds. Taxes have a big impact on financing decisions. Bond interest is generally tax deductible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe will also consider preferred stock financing. In many ways preferred stock is similar to debt financing because of the payments that are somewhat standardized. However, preferred stock does not have a maturity date and the payments are not generally tax deductible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe course will demonstrate common stock financing, a form of equity financing.

It was introduced by American engineer Bill Smith while working at Motorola in 1986. A six sigma process is one in which 99.99966% of all opportunities to produce some feature of a part are statistically expected to be free of defects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESix Sigma strategies seek to improve manufacturing quality by identifying and removing the causes of defects and minimizing variability in manufacturing and business processes. It does this by using empirical and statistical quality management methods and by hiring people who serve as Six Sigma experts. Each Six Sigma project follows a defined methodology and has specific value targets, such as reducing pollution or increasing customer satisfaction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe term \u003Cem\u003ESix Sigma\u003C/em\u003E originates from statistical modeling of manufacturing processes. The maturity of a manufacturing process can be described by a \u003Cem\u003Esigma\u003C/em\u003E rating indicating its yield or the percentage of defect-free products it creates\u2014specifically, to within how many standard deviations of a normal distribution the fraction of defect-free outcomes corresponds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHistory\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMotorola pioneered Six Sigma, setting a \u0022six sigma\u0022 goal for its manufacturing business. It registered Six Sigma as a service mark on June 11, 1991 U.S. Service Mark 1,647,704; on December 28, 1993, it registered Six Sigma as a trademark. In 2005 Motorola attributed over $17 billion in savings to Six Sigma.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHoneywell and General Electric were also early adopters of Six Sigma. As GE\u0027s CEO, in 1995 Jack Welch made it central to his business strategy, and in 1998 it announced $350 million in cost savings thanks to Six Sigma, which was an important factor in the spread of Six Sigma (this figure later grew to more than $1 billion). By the late 1990s, about two-thirds of the Fortune 500 organizations had begun Six Sigma initiatives with the aim of reducing costs and improving quality.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn recent years, some practitioners have combined Six Sigma ideas with lean manufacturing to create a methodology named Lean Six Sigma. The Lean Six Sigma methodology views lean manufacturing, which addresses process flow and waste issues, and Six Sigma, with its focus on variation and design, as complementary disciplines aimed at promoting \u0022business and operational excellence\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn 2011, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has published the first standard \u0022ISO 13053:2011\u0022 defining a Six Sigma process.
