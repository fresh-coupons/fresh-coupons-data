For example, network configuration files can be edited with ease using a text editor. Then those edits can be saved as a shell script for further modification or backup purposes.

Plus, it can be used for automated system maintenance such as stopping services, removing unwanted files.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBash scripting makes it easy to keep your Linux system secure and up-to-date with security patches and software updates. Most of these updates involve fixing bugs or adding new features to the system\u0027s core applications and libraries. Administrators can run scheduled updates and check for problems along the way via a cron job or other program tools. In addition, all security patches are automatically applied via automated scripts without any user intervention required.

Building a strong professional network can open doors to new career prospects and collaborations.","Personal Growth: Learning new skills and staying up-to-date with industry trends can be personally fulfilling. It can boost confidence and provide a sense of accomplishment, which in turn can enhance job satisfaction and overall well-being.","Learning programs in innovation and digital transformation are essential for both companies and experts.

These condensed, focused programs offer a taste of traditional MBA coursework without the time and financial commitments required by full-length MBA programs. Here\u0027s why Mini MBA programs are important for building careers and businesses:","1. Skill Enhancement: Mini MBA programs provide participants with a comprehensive understanding of key business principles, such as finance, marketing, strategy, and leadership.

Confidence Building: Mini MBA programs can boost the confidence of both employees and aspiring entrepreneurs. Knowing that you have a solid foundation in business concepts and strategies can empower you to take on new challenges and seize opportunities.","Mini MBA programs offer a cost-effective, time-efficient, and comprehensive way for both employers and experts to enhance their skills, advance their careers, and build successful businesses. Whether you are seeking career growth within an organization or aiming to launch your own venture, a Mini MBA program can provide the knowledge and confidence needed to achieve your goals in the dynamic world of business."],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":121,"averageValue":"3.9"},"instructors":[{"name":"MTF Institute of Management, Technology and Finance","url":"/user/mtfinstitute/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.134146}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"45E388A6AAE7C89AFA47","originalPrice":"\u20B91,699","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/web3-development-essentials/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5544558,"title":"Web3 Development Essentials","shortDescription":"Web3 Development Essentials Course by MTF Institute and QuickNode","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWelcome to course\u003C/strong\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003EWeb3 Development Essentials\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECourse developed by MTF Institute\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMTF Institute of Management, Technology and Finance\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMTF\u003C/strong\u003E is the global educational and research institute with HQ at Lisbon, Portugal, focused on higher \u0026amp; professional hybrid (on-campus and online) education at areas: Business \u0026amp; Administration, Science \u0026amp; Technology, Banking \u0026amp; Finance. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMTF R\u0026amp;D \u003C/strong\u003Ecenter focused on research activities at areas: Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Data Science, Big Data, WEB3, Blockchain, Cryptocurrency \u0026amp; Digital Assets, Metaverses, Digital Transformation, Fintech, Electronic Commerce, Internet of Things. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMTF\u003C/strong\u003E is the official partner of: IBM, Intel, Microsoft, member of the Portuguese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and resident of the incubator \u0022The Fintech House of Portugal\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMTF \u003C/strong\u003Eis present in 201 countries and has been chosen by more than 165,000 students.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EQuickNode\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuickNode simplifies blockchain infrastructure for teams big \u0026amp; small.

Did you build a couple of projects with PHP and MySQL, but you still think you are inexperienced and you are missing out on a lot of things when coming to developing bigger projects? If yes, then this course is the right resource for you. This course is very digestible and informative and it was created specifically to enhance your coding skills and knowledge not just in PHP and MySQL, but overall in developing web projects. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is what we are going to do in this course. Naturally, we are going to get started by setting up the right tools for our projects. And after that, we are going to build our first simple yet very interesting project and that\u0027s a URL shortening service. The second project will be about sending emails in PHP and that\u0027s very important because it\u0027s a feature that almost every website has. The next project will be the starting of something big because it\u0027s an authentication system where I am going to teach you how to develop a login and a register page, how to hash and de-hash passwords, how to do validation and so much more. After this, we are going to build a comments system and this will be the biggest project in this course. We will begin first by doing a post system and then we will grab comments for every post that we have of course we will use Ajax-JQuery for inserting, deleting, and showing comments. after that, we will integrate a rating system into the previous two projects to make a bigger project. So, I will show how to download a JQuery plugin, how to integrate it and how to use it to do the rating system for every post, and so on. And the rating system is going to be implemented of course using Ajax-JQuery. The upcoming project is going to be also created with Ajax and JQuery and that\u0027s a live search system and we will combine it with our big project. The last project will be about building a weather app. All we are going to do is set up a form, allow the user to enter a city, and then give him the current degree of this city. So we will use an API to grab the current degree for this city.

It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables.
