We will demonstrate how Deep Learning has re-shaped this area of Artificial Intelligence using concepts like word vectors and embeddings, strucutured deep learning, collaborative filtering, recurrent neural networks, sequence-to-sequence models and transformer networks. In our journey, we will be mostly concerned with how to represent the language tokens, being at the word or character level, and and how to represent their aggregation, like sentences or documents, in a semantically sound way. We start the journey by going through the traditional pipeline of text pre-processing and the different text features like binary and TF-IDF\u0026nbsp;features with the Bag-of-Words model. Then we will dive into the concepts of word vectors and embeddings as a general deep learning concept, with detailed discussion of famous word embedding techniques like word2vec, GloVe, Fasttext and ELMo. This will enable us to divert into recommender systems, using collaborative filtering and twin-tower model as an example of the generic usage of embeddings beyond word representations. In the second part of the course, we will be concerned with sentence and sequence representations. We will tackle the core NLP of Langauge Modeling, at statistical and neural levels, using recurrent models, like LSTM\u0026nbsp;and GRU. In the following part, we tackle sequence-to-sequence models, with the flagship NLP\u0026nbsp;task of Machine Translation, which paves the way to talk about many other tasks under the same design seq2seq pattern, like Question-Answering and Chatbots. We present the core idea idea of Attention mechanisms with recurrent seq2seq, before we generalize it as a generic deep learning concept. This generalization leads to the to the state-of-the art Transformer Network, which revolutionized the world of NLP, using full attention mechanisms. In the final part of the course, we present the ImageNet moment of NLP, where Transfer Learning comes into play together with pre-trained Transfomer architectures like BERT, GPT 1-2-3, RoBERTa, ALBERT, XLTransformer and XLNet.\u0026nbsp; \u003C/p\u003E","language":"Arabic","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/deep-learning-for-natural-language-processing/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4663084_3dd8.jpg","duration":"11 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"11,789.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Beginner level NLP engineers and data scientists"],"tags":["Deep Learning"],"rating":{"count":305,"averageValue":"4.6"},"instructors":[{"name":"Coursat.ai Dr. Ahmad ElSallab","url":"/user/coursatai/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.584746}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"25686B76F52544BD998B","originalPrice":"\u20B92,299","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-networking-fundamentals-course-ccna-start/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":751094,"title":"The Complete Networking Fundamentals Course.

Here also you discover that you still have a long Journey to go after your model is already performing great on your training machine. Finally, Software Engineers, who have their primary job is to build a working system or an app, often find themselves in a situation where they need to integrate an AI model in their software, which happens a lot today with the expansion of AI applications. They might get this model from a research team in their firm or company, or even use an API or pre-trained model on the internet to do their task.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe cover all those deployment scenarios, covering the journey from working trained model to an optimized deployed model.

A leader is someone who influences, motivates, and empowers others to achieve their best potential. Leadership is not limited to a formal position; it can emerge at various levels within an organization. Effective leaders possess qualities such as vision, communication skills, empathy, and the ability to make strategic decisions.","Management, on the other hand, is the process of planning, organizing, and coordinating resources to achieve specific objectives.

Effective managers excel in organizational skills, problem-solving, and decision-making.","Importance of Learning about Leadership and Management:  Organizational Success: Understanding and implementing effective leadership and management practices contribute to the overall success of an organization. Well-led and well-managed teams are more likely to meet goals and adapt to changing circumstances.  Employee Engagement: Leaders who can inspire and motivate their teams foster a positive work environment. Engaged employees are more productive, creative, and committed to the organization\u0027s success.  Effective Communication: Leadership and management skills involve effective communication, both within the team and with external stakeholders. Clear communication helps in avoiding misunderstandings and ensures everyone is on the same page.  Adaptability: In today\u0027s dynamic business environment, the ability to adapt to change is crucial. Leaders and managers must be agile and capable of guiding their teams through various challenges and transformations.  Conflict Resolution: Leadership and management training often includes conflict resolution skills.

In this course, we will cover three main parts. The first part covers the essentials of traditional computer vision pipeline, and how to deal with images in OpenCV and Pillow libraries, including the image pre-processing pipeline like:\u0026nbsp; thresholding, denoising, blurring, filtering, edge detection,\u0026nbsp; contours...etc. We will build simple apps like Car License Plate Detection (LPD) and activity recogntion. This will lead us to the revolution that deep learning brought to the game of computer vision, turning traditional filters into learnable parameters using Convolution Neural Networks. We will cover all the basics of ConvNets, including the details of the Vanilla architecture for image classification, hyper parameters like kernels, strides, maxpool and feature maps sizes calculations. Beyond the Vanilla architecture, we also cover the state-of-the art ConvNet meta-architectures and design patters, like skip-connnections, Inception, DenseNet...etc. In the second part, we will learn how to use ConvNets to solve practical problems in different situations, with small amount of data, how to use transfer learning and the different scenarios for that, and finally how to debug and visualize the leant kernels in ConvNets. In the last part, we will learn about different CV\u0026nbsp;apps using ConvNets. We will learn about the Encoder-Decoder design pattern. We start by the task of semantic segmentation, where we will build a U-Net architecture from scratch for the Cambridge Video (CAMVID) dataset. Then we will learn about Object Detection, covering both 2-stage and one-shot architectures like SSD and YOLO. Next, we will learn how to deal with the video data using the Spatio-Temporal ConvNet architectures. Finally we will introduce 3D Deep Learning to extend ConvNets usage to deal with 3D data, like LiDAR data.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"Arabic","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/deep-learning-for-computer-vision/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4661416_29ea.jpg","duration":"10 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"8,506.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Beginner level computer vision engineer"],"tags":["Deep Learning"],"rating":{"count":250,"averageValue":"4.8"},"instructors":[{"name":"Coursat.ai Dr. Ahmad ElSallab","url":"/user/coursatai/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.76}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"DC938ECD77874BD2BE8B","originalPrice":"\u20B92,699","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/presentations-with-chatgpt/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":6207903,"title":"Presentations with ChatGPT","shortDescription":"Supercharge Your Presentations: ChatGPT-Generated Outlines, Automation, and Design","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECourse Description: Presentations with ChatGPT\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to \u0022Presentations with ChatGPT,\u0022 an innovative and comprehensive course designed to revolutionize how you create and deliver presentations.

Course for any who want to build a career at Web3 or improve their knowledge.","Web3 refers to the next generation of the internet, often referred to as the decentralized web. It is envisioned as a more transparent, secure, and user-centric version of the internet, enabled by blockchain technology and decentralized protocols. In Web3, users have more control over their data and digital identities, and intermediaries such as centralized platforms are minimized or eliminated. This decentralized architecture offers various benefits such as increased privacy, censorship resistance, and the ability to create trustless interactions through smart contracts.","NFT stands for Non-Fungible Token. NFTs are unique digital assets that represent ownership or proof of authenticity of a particular item or piece of content, typically stored on a blockchain. Unlike cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, which are fungible and can be exchanged on a one-to-one basis, NFTs are indivisible and cannot be exchanged on a like-for-like basis due to their unique attributes. NFTs have gained significant attention in recent years, especially in the realms of digital art, collectibles, gaming, and virtual real estate, as they provide a way to establish scarcity and ownership in the digital world.","Learning about Web3 and NFTs is important for companies and managers for several reasons:  Understanding Emerging Technologies: Web3 and NFTs represent significant shifts in how we interact with the internet and digital assets. By staying informed about these technologies, companies and managers can anticipate trends and adapt their strategies accordingly.  New Business Opportunities: Web3 and NFTs open up new avenues for innovation and revenue generation. Companies that embrace these technologies can explore novel business models, such as decentralized finance (DeFi), tokenized assets, and digital collectibles.  Enhanced Customer Engagement: NFTs enable unique and personalized experiences for customers, whether through digital art, exclusive content, or virtual goods. By leveraging NFTs, companies can deepen customer engagement and foster a sense of community around their brand.  Mitigating Risks: As blockchain technology becomes more prevalent, understanding its implications becomes crucial for risk management. Companies need to grasp the security and regulatory considerations associated with Web3 and NFTs to protect their assets and reputation.","Developing skills in Web3 and NFTs can support career advancement or the launch of a business in several ways:  Technical Proficiency: Learning blockchain development, smart contract programming, and NFT standards (such as ERC-721 or ERC-1155) can open up opportunities for technical roles in blockchain-focused companies or projects.  Entrepreneurial Ventures: Individuals with expertise in Web3 and NFTs can capitalize on the growing demand for blockchain-based solutions by starting their own businesses. This could involve creating NFT marketplaces, developing blockchain games, or providing consultancy services to companies exploring blockchain integration.  Strategic Leadership: Managers who understand the potential of Web3 and NFTs can drive innovation within their organizations and guide strategic decisions related to blockchain adoption. This may involve identifying use cases, forming partnerships with blockchain startups, or implementing pilot projects to test new ideas.  Personal Branding: Building a reputation as a thought leader or expert in Web3 and NFTs can enhance career prospects and attract opportunities for speaking engagements, advisory roles, or partnerships.","In conclusion, learning about Web3 and NFTs is essential for companies and managers to stay competitive in a rapidly evolving digital landscape.

A successful manager is now expected to act as a leader, a mentor, and a coach, guiding their team members towards individual and collective success. This paradigm shift highlights the significance of coaching techniques in the realm of managerial responsibilities.","The Transformation of Managerial Roles  Evolving Leadership Expectations  The traditional image of a manager as a stern authority figure has given way to a more holistic view of leadership. Managers are now expected to serve as role models, motivators, and mentors to their teams. This shift stems from the recognition that employees perform at their best when they feel valued, supported, and empowered.  The evolution of leadership expectations can be traced back to the changing dynamics of the modern workplace. In the past, managers were primarily responsible for enforcing rules and ensuring productivity. However, as organizations began to realize that employee engagement and satisfaction were crucial for success, a transformation in managerial roles ensued.  Today, managers are not just tasked with overseeing tasks and projects; they are expected to inspire and empower their teams. This shift is partly a response to the changing nature of work itself. In a knowledge-based economy, where creativity, innovation, and adaptability are paramount, traditional top-down management no longer suffices.","Coaching as a Leadership Skill  Coaching has emerged as a pivotal leadership skill that fosters personal and professional growth. We\u0027ll explore how coaching techniques, such as active listening, constructive feedback, and goal-setting, can empower managers to become effective leaders who inspire and guide their teams towards excellence.  Coaching is not a one-size-fits-all approach; it is a dynamic and personalized method of leadership. Effective coaches adapt their style to the needs and preferences of individual team members. They actively listen to understand the unique challenges and aspirations of each employee, fostering a sense of trust and rapport.  Moreover, coaching is not merely about providing solutions but guiding employees to discover answers themselves. This approach instills a sense of ownership and accountability in team members. It encourages them to take the initiative, think critically, and develop problem-solving skills\u2014a valuable asset in today\u0027s fast-paced, ever-changing business landscape.  Coaching also plays a crucial role in setting and achieving goals. Effective managers use coaching techniques to collaboratively define clear, actionable objectives with their team members. This process not only aligns individual efforts with organizational goals but also empowers employees to track their progress and make necessary adjustments along the way.","Coaching Knowledge for Career Development  Career Development in the Modern Workplace  Career development is a top priority for employees. Discover how coaching knowledge equips managers with the tools to help team members navigate their career paths, set meaningful goals, and continually improve their skills.  Career development has evolved from being a peripheral concern to a central focus in the modern workplace. In an era marked by rapid technological advancements and industry disruptions, employees recognize the importance of continuous learning and skill enhancement to remain relevant and competitive.  This heightened emphasis on career development places managers at the forefront of helping their team members chart their professional journeys. Coaching knowledge equips managers with the ability to provide guidance that is not only aligned with the organization\u0027s needs but also tailored to the aspirations of individual employees.  One of the key advantages of coaching in career development is its ability to facilitate self-awareness. Effective coaches help employees identify their strengths, weaknesses, interests, and values. Armed with this self-knowledge, employees can make informed career decisions that align with their passions and long-term goals.","The Manager as a Career Development Partner  Explore the responsibilities of middle and top managers in preparing and mentoring personal development plans for their team members. Learn how these plans can align with organizational objectives and create a win-win situation for both employees and the company.  Managers who actively engage in career development become indispensable partners in their employees\u0027 professional growth. They play a pivotal role in creating personalized development plans that leverage individual strengths and address areas needing improvement.  These development plans not only benefit the employees but also the organization. By aligning individual development goals with the company\u0027s strategic objectives, managers ensure that every team member\u0027s growth contributes to the overall success of the business.  Furthermore, coaching techniques are instrumental in fostering a growth mindset within teams. Managers can use coaching to encourage employees to embrace challenges, persist in the face of setbacks, and view failures as opportunities for learning and improvement. This mindset shift has a profound impact on team performance and innovation.","Coaching for Internal Education and Employee Development  The Role of Managers in Internal Education  Managers often bear the responsibility of nurturing a culture of learning within their teams and organizations. Explore how coaching methods can be instrumental in identifying and addressing skill gaps, fostering innovation, and supporting ongoing employee development.  Organizations that prioritize learning and development gain a competitive edge. Managers are at the forefront of this initiative, serving as the catalysts for continuous improvement and innovation within their teams.  Coaching methods play a pivotal role in identifying and addressing skill gaps. By regularly assessing the competencies of their team members, managers can tailor training and development programs to bridge these gaps effectively. This proactive approach not only enhances individual skills but also bolsters the organization\u0027s overall capabilities.  Moreover, coaching encourages a culture of innovation. Effective coaches inspire creativity and critical thinking in their teams. They challenge employees to question the status quo, explore new ideas, and experiment with novel approaches. In this way, managers act as innovation champions, driving progress and adaptability.","Coaching as a Tool for Employee Empowerment  Employee empowerment is a cornerstone of effective leadership. Coaching techniques provide managers with the tools to empower their team members by fostering a sense of ownership and autonomy in their roles.  One of the primary ways coaching empowers employees is by promoting self-directed learning. Instead of relying solely on formal training programs, employees learn to identify their development needs and take initiative in seeking resources and opportunities for growth. Managers who coach effectively encourage this proactive approach.  Furthermore, coaching cultivates a growth-oriented mindset among employees. When team members receive regular feedback, both positive and constructive, they become more receptive to continuous improvement. They view challenges as opportunities for growth and development, which ultimately leads to higher levels of engagement and performance.  By creating an environment where continuous learning is celebrated, managers inspire their teams to thrive in an ever-changing business landscape. This culture of learning becomes a strategic advantage for organizations, as it enables them to adapt quickly to new challenges and opportunities.","Coaching for Mental Health and Well-being  The Manager as a Trusted Support System  For many employees, especially those who live alone or lack a strong support network, a manager can become their most trusted confidant.
