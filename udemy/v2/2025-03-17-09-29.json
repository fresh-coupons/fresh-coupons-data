I found this course created by TJ Walker a perfect introduction to the world of media training. I wanted to learn, not only what a media trainer does, but also what steps I would have to take in order to become a successful media trainer--TJ discusses all this in a clear and concise manner, in a tone that is welcoming and never alienating. The only constructive critique I would give would be concerning the technical form of the presentation, more specifically the video quality and picture aesthetic. Going by the current standard as it applies to video, everything we view is in high definition. Having said that, I believe the video quality could be improved upon as well as the backdrop which I found to be a bit generic and outdated. I found these minor flaws to be slightly distracting and given the high caliber of the speaker and the information being presented I believe these aspects detracted, if only marginally, from the quality of the product.\u0022\u0026nbsp;\u003C/em\u003ENick Cisik\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u00225 Stars!

Course for any who want to build a career at Web3 or improve their knowledge.","Web3 refers to the next generation of the internet, often referred to as the decentralized web. It is envisioned as a more transparent, secure, and user-centric version of the internet, enabled by blockchain technology and decentralized protocols. In Web3, users have more control over their data and digital identities, and intermediaries such as centralized platforms are minimized or eliminated. This decentralized architecture offers various benefits such as increased privacy, censorship resistance, and the ability to create trustless interactions through smart contracts.","NFT stands for Non-Fungible Token. NFTs are unique digital assets that represent ownership or proof of authenticity of a particular item or piece of content, typically stored on a blockchain. Unlike cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, which are fungible and can be exchanged on a one-to-one basis, NFTs are indivisible and cannot be exchanged on a like-for-like basis due to their unique attributes. NFTs have gained significant attention in recent years, especially in the realms of digital art, collectibles, gaming, and virtual real estate, as they provide a way to establish scarcity and ownership in the digital world.","Learning about Web3 and NFTs is important for companies and managers for several reasons:  Understanding Emerging Technologies: Web3 and NFTs represent significant shifts in how we interact with the internet and digital assets. By staying informed about these technologies, companies and managers can anticipate trends and adapt their strategies accordingly.  New Business Opportunities: Web3 and NFTs open up new avenues for innovation and revenue generation. Companies that embrace these technologies can explore novel business models, such as decentralized finance (DeFi), tokenized assets, and digital collectibles.  Enhanced Customer Engagement: NFTs enable unique and personalized experiences for customers, whether through digital art, exclusive content, or virtual goods. By leveraging NFTs, companies can deepen customer engagement and foster a sense of community around their brand.","Mitigating Risks: As blockchain technology becomes more prevalent, understanding its implications becomes crucial for risk management. Companies need to grasp the security and regulatory considerations associated with Web3 and NFTs to protect their assets and reputation.  Developing skills in Web3 and NFTs can support career advancement or the launch of a business in several ways:  Technical Proficiency: Learning blockchain development, smart contract programming, and NFT standards (such as ERC-721 or ERC-1155) can open up opportunities for technical roles in blockchain-focused companies or projects.","Entrepreneurial Ventures: Individuals with expertise in Web3 and NFTs can capitalize on the growing demand for blockchain-based solutions by starting their own businesses.

It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E*\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E javascript course contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript introduction\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript array\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript variables\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript functions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript objects\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript control statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript cookies\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript loop statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript data structures\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript error handling\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript regular expressions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003Esection 3- learn PHP\u0026nbsp;programming language\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this section, we will learn the basic structure of a web application, and how a web browser interacts with a web server.
