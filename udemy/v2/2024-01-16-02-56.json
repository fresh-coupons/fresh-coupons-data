The training program will help the trainee to perform all the statistical analysis with Minitab. It is also intended to make the trainees cover all the topics that fall under the domain of Minitab. Topics like Minitab GUI and Descriptive Statistics, Statistical Analysis using Minitab, Correlation Techniques in Minitab and Predictive Modeling using Excel will be covered in this training module and Project on Data Analytics using Minitab and Project on Minitab \u2013 Regression Modeling will be covered in the project module. The goal of this course is to help an individual to achieve knowledge of working with Minitab to perform time series analysis and forecasting of data in all sorts of statistics based problems. It will help all the interested trainees who are willing to extend their knowledge base concerned with Data analytics.

Let us start to understand what Minitab is. Minitab is a software used in use cases of statistics. Minitab, as the software is capable of data analysis, pattern detection through statistics, data crunching. Most of the calculation is automated, and graphs are generated as per the functionality required by the analyst working on the use cases. For this course specifically, we would be exploiting the use of Minitab for Time Series Analysis and Forecasting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, let us understand what time series analysis is. Time series data is a collection of data over some time or interval. The data when captured over time typically might have some internal structure, for example, autocorrelation, trends, seasonality, stationarity, and many such fundamentals. For example, let us think about the sales of umbrellas or raincoats. We can see that in the selling of these items we might encounter a seasonality aspect, that they might be sold high during the onset of the rainy season. Also, we can see that the data itself might auto-correlate itself to the promos that might have been set by some stores, online or offline, and many more such intricate detailing through the understanding of time series analysis fundamentals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow when we know how to analyze the time series it becomes pretty evident that what exactly to do with the studies or hypothesis we developed as a part of the study. The answer lies in prediction! We would understand the fundamentals through historical time series data and then utilize that deep insight to predict or forecast for the future. In this way, we would be able to capture the historical trends and seasonality and utilize them to have a better insight into what\u2019s in store in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis course is a collection of well-crafted tutorials or topics we would naturally go about if we must fully understand the topic of time series analysis and forecasting. This course will allow you to get a sense of what is lying in the basket of time series analysis in the professional project which you would encounter as soon as you take up the project in your organization.

In the RIP protocol, the oldest of the vectors for distance IP Routing protocols are still put to use and thereby getting various enhancements. There are currently two versions that exist for the RIP viz. RIPv1 and RIPv2. RIPv1 is also said to be the classful protocol which means that it is not classless whereas if you talk about the RIPv2, it is considered to be the classless support routing protocol and IPv6 is the one whose support is extended to RIPv2 with the next-gen RIP which is also termed as RIPng. EIGRP, on the other hand, is related to the Interior Gateway protocol as it is a proprietary protocol of the company CISCO. This protocol is occasionally described as the distance vector routing protocol which also acts and imitates like a link state-oriented protocol. Distance vector-based protocols share everything of which they are aware of. The only limitation they carry is that the amount of information shared is only among the neighbors which are directly or indirectly connected with each other. Link state-based protocols announce that the information present is only about the direction and not indirectly connected links.

It is another category belonging to the set of regression techniques that combines the properties of both Linear as well as Logistic regressions.

SAS provides built-in functions to calculate and evaluate the Poisson regression model. Poisson regression is useful to predict the value of the response variable Y by using one or more explanatory variable X. This is a preferred probability distribution which is of discrete type. One of the use cases of a Poisson regression model would be predicting the number of leads that will convert to customers within a particular time frame in an organization.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn Probability and Statistics, there are three distributions based on continuous and discrete data \u2013 Normal, Binomial, and Poisson Distributions. \u003Cstrong\u003ENormal Distribution\u003C/strong\u003E is often seen as a Bell Curve.

To do that java program makes use of API in io. the package which has a class for each device. Java IO is an API deal with core classes that comes with reading and writing data from the networks. Java IO consists of many subclasses for file access, buffering, network access, filtering, intercommunication, pipes, reading, and writing text. Java IO has two types of streams namely input streams and output streams. They are programming interfaces to the streams. Two general-purpose classes file input stream and file output stream used to copy a file to file. It also has some classes for the file to represent a file, random access files, Tokenizer. file handling in Java is performed by Java IO API. when a user request to process a read a file, a file system determines where the file lives in the drive then it places them in the memory. While talking about Output stream class there are useful methods of output stream respectively with a hierarchy and similar to this is Input streams java io package has object input and object output respectively.

It identifies who has power and accountability, and who makes decisions. It is, in essence, a toolkit that enables management and the board to deal more effectively with the challenges of running a company. Corporate governance ensures that businesses have appropriate decision-making processes and controls in place so that the interests of all stakeholders (shareholders, employees, suppliers, customers and the community) are balanced. Good corporate governance can benefit investors and other stakeholders, while bad governance can lead to scandal and ruin. Governance refers to the set of rules, controls, policies, and resolutions put in place to direct corporate behavior. A board of directors is pivotal in governance, while proxy advisors and shareholders are important stakeholders who can affect governance. Communicating a company\u0027s corporate governance is a key component of community and investor relations. For instance, Apple Inc.\u0027s investor relations site profiles its corporate leadership (the executive team and board of directors) and provides information on its committee charters and governance documents, such as bylaws, stock ownership guidelines, and articles of incorporation. Most successful companies strive to have exemplary corporate governance. For many shareholders, it is not enough for a company to be profitable; it also must demonstrate good corporate citizenship through environmental awareness, ethical behavior, and other sound corporate governance practices.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/corporate-governance-us-and-uk-markets/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5621750_ba49.jpg","duration":"2.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"2,622.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Bankers, Accountants, Stakeholders of a company, Anyone who wants to learn about corporate governance"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":4,"averageValue":"4.2"},"instructors":[{"name":"EDUCBA Bridging the Gap","url":"/user/premananda-suna/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.125}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"EDUCBANY24","originalPrice":"\u20B91,999","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/ai-content-course/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5219242,"title":"Learn Content Writing using AI \u0026 Make Money Online","shortDescription":"Start Freelance Content Creation with AI: Generate SEO-Friendly Copy and Compelling Images, Hone Your Copywriting Skills","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECreate Killer Content with AI: Generate SEO-Friendly Copy and Compelling Images, Hone Your Copywriting Skills, and Monetize Your Talents Online\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre you struggling to come up with fresh ideas for your blog, social media posts, or marketing campaigns?

It provides us with the list of services and various tools which are required for building the Mobile User Interface with the native feel and the same look. The ionic framework needs to have a native wrapper interface using which it will be able to run the ionic based applications on mobile devices. Moreover, it can be known to be the front-end based HTML framework which comprises many front end languages, and therefore it is built on top of the possibly best front end framework, AngularJS, and Cordova. It is an HTML5 based Mobile Application development framework which is targeted at building mobile-based hybrid apps. Ionic can be thought of as a front end UI framework that is used to handle the basic look and feel and the User interface based interactions that are required for the app to be compelling. It is somewhat like Bootstrap for native applications that are built for the support of a broad range of common and basic native mobile-based components, beautiful design, and slick animations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe features would include AngularJS based Model View Controller architecture for creating and building rich SPAs also known as Single Page Applications particularly optimized for the device and mobile-based devices. Other features would include CSS components that come along with the native look and feel and are used to provide all the elements which are typically required by a mobile-based web application. The default styling of the components can be easily overridden which can accommodate their designs. The JavaScript components extend the CSS component capabilities and also Javascript related functions and their capabilities to cover the mobile elements which cannot be only done with HTML and CSS. Other features include the ones related to Cordova plugins that offer the API related to the usage of the mobile-based native device functions with JavaScript code. The Ionic CLI is a NodeJS based utility which is powered by the various commands required for building, starting, running as well as emulating ionic applications. The views are a very useful platform that is required for sharing, uploading, and testing your applications for native devices.

This tool makes use of PigLatin language which is used along with Hadoop for data manipulation and their operations. Pig Latin is a high-level language which provides numerous operators using which programmers can develop their functions for reading, writing as well as processing the data. To be able to do data analysis through this tool, the script must be composed using the Pig Latin language. The scripts are then converted to Map and Reduce tasks. Pig Engine accepts the pig Latin scripts as its inputs thereby generating map-reduce jobs. The pig training is best for all the programmers as it ensures that complex pieces of Java code are not required now to execute simple tasks and achieve simple functionality. Instead, it follows a multi-query approach which reduces the lines of code used for programming. Just to compare 200 lines of Java code can be done in 10 lines of PIG code.
