The user inputs the character through an HTML form and the result is displayed on the page, styled with CSS. The project uses the String.fromCharCode() function to convert the character to a string. The charCodeAt() function is then used to get the ASCII code of the character. If the ASCII code is between 0 and 127, the character is an ASCII character. Otherwise, the character is a Unicode character.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAnalog Clock Application:\u003C/strong\u003E This project displays an analog clock with the current time on an HTML page using JavaScript.
