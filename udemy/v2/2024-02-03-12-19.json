In Python, OOP allows developers to organize code into reusable, self-contained objects that encapsulate data and behavior. These objects are created from classes, which serve as blueprints for creating multiple instances.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe key concepts of OOP in Python include classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism. Classes define the structure and behavior of objects, while objects are instances of classes that can hold data (attributes) and perform actions (methods). Inheritance enables the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes, allowing subclasses to inherit and extend the properties of parent classes. Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated interchangeably, enhancing flexibility and code reusability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy using OOP in Python, developers can achieve modularity, abstraction, and code reuse, making it easier to build and maintain complex software systems.

By taking such a step, the aim of the private equity firm is to earn a return of 20 -25 percent which is far in excess of the \u201Chistorical average annual return\u201D in case of the stock markets. The leveraged buyouts are more or less same to the normal deals of merger and acquisitions; the only difference is that in a leveraged buyout, the assumption is that the buyer will be selling the target in future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe working of the Concept of Leveraged BuyOut and LBO Model\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere exists a similarity between purchasing a house and leveraged buyout as a combination of down payment as well as a mortgage can be made use of. In the case of both these transactions, there is saving of money as a small amount is put down in cash and the remaining is borrowed. In case of the leveraged buyout, the \u201Cdown payment\u201D is known as the equity or the cash whereas the \u201Cmortgage\u201D is known as the debt. The debt is utilised by the private equity firms for boosting its returns. If everything else is equivalent, it means that if the private equity firm makes use of more leverage or debt, the firm is likely to earn a higher rate of return on the investment that has been made by it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as the real LBO model is concerned, the repayment of debt is made by the companies over a period of time which boosts the returns of the private equity firm even more.

Learners will come away with an in-depth understanding of the world of forensic accounting and the many ways in which it may differ from the typical accountant\u2019s role. Forensic accounting is the investigation of fraud or financial manipulation by performing extremely detailed research and analysis of financial information. Forensic accountants are often hired to prepare for litigation related to insurance claims, insolvency, divorces, embezzlement, fraud, skimming, and any type of financial theft. Forensic accountants or auditors take a unique focus on performing their work. Typically, when a person with forensic experience is called in to examine financial records, it is due to suspicion of fraud, evaluation of assets, or even to track down fundamentally incorrect accounting.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/forensic-accounting-fraud-detection-and-investigation/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5615328_42e9.jpg","duration":"3 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"1,906.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Students, Professionals, Accountants, Tax professionals, Anyone who wants to understand forensic accounting"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":16,"averageValue":"4.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"EDUCBA Bridging the Gap","url":"/user/premananda-suna/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.392857}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"EDUCBA2NY2024","originalPrice":"\u20B93,499","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"1 day","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/java-servlets-complete-course-bundle/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5672446,"title":"Java Servlets - Complete Course Bundle","shortDescription":"Learn how to use Java Servlets to develop web-based applications","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EThe main objective of the training is to make you get good hands-on experience on the Java servlet.

PyQt is a free version under GPL which means General Public License that is it is free only when the code written by you or the developer is not sold and if the code needs to be sold then it no longer a free version in PyQt as it considers it as commercial so we need to do the payments or purchase it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn PyQt it has PyQtgraph which is built on PyQt4 or PySide or NumPy which also having fast pipelines as it has heavy leverage of NumPy libraries. It Provides various UI components such as widgets which include buttons, menus, labels, tables, etc, and all other designable widgets that are compatible with PyQt as QT provides all these UI components in Python.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt also can be used with several input devices such as keyboards or mouse and it does not offer much as in Kivy frameworks. The main drawback of PyQt is not available with any specific resources which mean it can be used in the data in C\u002B\u002B only where it sometimes may make developers complex in designing as it needs more experience in C\u002B\u002B. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPyQt is mostly recommended for building truly native applications that mostly rely on desktop software or applications which means it most suitable for desktop applications.

It is platform-independent and easily portable. Java can be used to develop web applications, standalone GUI applications and complex large-scale distributed applications to enable the resolution of complex solutions more easily. Java is an object-oriented Programming Language and functional features have been added in the recently released Java versions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJava was developed and is being maintained by Oracle Corporation. It is a general-purpose programming language which has concurrent and multi-threading programming features. Java is safe, static and strongly typed programming language. Java has a special runtime environment called JRE which provided an execution environment instances called Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to enable the running of Java applications as Java bytecodes (conversion of high-level code to machine level code). The theme of the Java application development is Write Once and Run Anywhere while developing applications. It is most popular in client-server application development.

Welcome to Master Practical Java Development. This course is designed to help you master the most in-demand and critical components for becoming a Core Java developer. Especially if you\u0027re going for a job interview or have a Java Project that needs your best performance. This course assumes no prior java experience so prior Java so it will take you from zero to hero. The topics covered include Object Orientation which I think is not stressed enough in other Java courses so I\u0027ve got special focus on that throughout the lectures. You\u0027ll get plenty of practice writing classes and interfaces as well as countless methods with loops and if else statements, exception handling and file processing as well as how to debug software using Eclipse. You\u0027ll also be mastering the collections framework and diving deep into java generics. You\u0027ll learn all there is to know about multi-threading and the JDBC API for working with a MySQL database. There are also practical projects scattered throughout the course so that you can practice the concepts as you learn them. \u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/java-certification-course-with-interview-questions/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5680704_1c94.jpg","duration":"18 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"4,152.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Anyone interested in breaking into the Java development career","Those who have never programmed before, and wish to start their journey with Java"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":9,"averageValue":"4.7"},"instructors":[{"name":"EDUCBA Bridging the Gap","url":"/user/premananda-suna/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.6666665}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"EDUCBA2NY2024","originalPrice":"\u20B93,499","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"1 day","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/linux-command-line-terminal-basic-for-beginner-in-hindi/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":3684468,"title":"Linux Command Line Terminal Basic for Beginners (In Hindi)","shortDescription":"This is an introductory course to the Linux command line \u0026 Learn from the Scratch (In Hindi) - Created in 2021","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EStudent Feedback\u003C/strong\u003E ?\u003Cstrong\u003E:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESiddhi Rajesh Kulkarni: \u003C/strong\u003EIt is really an amazing course .
