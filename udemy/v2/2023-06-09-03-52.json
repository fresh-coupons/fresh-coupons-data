At its core, HTML provides the basic structure and content of a webpage. It uses a system of tags and attributes to define elements like headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more. These tags act as containers for content, allowing developers to create a meaningful and organized layout for their webpages.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you begin your study of HTML, you will learn about the key elements that make up the structure of a webpage. These include the doctype declaration, the html element, head and body elements, and a variety of content-specific tags. You will also explore semantic HTML, which emphasizes the use of meaningful tags to convey the purpose and structure of content, ultimately making the web more accessible and search-engine friendly.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECSS: Styling the Web\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/strong\u003EWhile HTML provides the foundation of a webpage, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) brings it to life with style and flair. CSS is a stylesheet language that allows developers to control the visual presentation of HTML elements, including colors, fonts, layout, and even animations. By separating content (HTML) from presentation (CSS), developers can create consistent and maintainable designs across multiple webpages.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThroughout this course, you will explore various CSS properties and selectors that allow you to target and style specific HTML elements.

This course provides an in-depth overview of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). The EC2 service is an essential building block in becoming an AWS certified cloud practitioner. We will start with exploring key concepts relevant to EC2, followed by a hands-on practical guide to deploying compute resources on AWS. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe term \u201CScalable Cloud Computing\u201D has now become synonymous with Amazon Web Services. For nearly a decade, AWS has been powering some of the world\u2019s most popular websites and applications. Amazon EC2, is considered the computational backbone of AWS.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ETo illustrate how Amazon EC2 works, we explore the concept of virtualization. Virtualization is the process of creating a software-based virtual representation of a server. When we deploy an EC2 \u201CInstance\u201D we\u2019re creating a virtual representation of a physical server and it\u2019s resources.\u003Cstrong\u003E \u003C/strong\u003EThis includes: CPU, Memory (RAM), Storage, and network resources such as Bandwidth. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ESimilar to physical servers that you might find on-premises,\u003Cstrong\u003E \u003C/strong\u003Evirtual EC2 instances can also have different configurations. As a matter of fact, AWS offers the most comprehensive configuration options when it comes to deploying virtual servers.\u003Cstrong\u003E \u003C/strong\u003EThese configurations can easily be adapted to our resource needs, in real-time.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe level of customization a cloud provider can accommodate, will define the sophistication level of it\u2019s overall service. Not all cloud services were created equal. AWS, is known to have the highest level of configuration options when compared to just about any other service. The AWS platform caters to both micro and enterprise level clients, using one of the most scalable and advanced virtualization infrastructures available.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EBeyond the physical hardware customization and scalability, virtualization also accommodates the deployment of any operating system on the virtual machine. As you will see, we have the flexibility of deploying both Linux and Windows servers, using a variety of pre-configured virtual applications known as AMIs (Amazon Machine Images).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to a theoretical deep dive into Amazon EC2, this course will also provide you with practical hands-on experience in working with the key features of EC2.

Includes JSX, Callbacks, Events, \u002B More","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EThis course takes you step-by-step through the process of building a fully functional calculator in React. React, also known as React JS, is a powerful JavaScript library used for building custom, interactive user interfaces using UI components. Some of the most well known examples of organizations using React for their front-end include Netflix, Facebook, and Airbnb. Developed and maintained by Meta along with a community of independent developers, React remains free and open-source. React is a component based library built entirely on JavaScript, which makes it perfect for designing complex UI\u2019s. With React, developers can build encapsulated components that efficiently manage their own state and render UI updates specifically when data changes. For example, think of the automated content refresh feature you see on a twitter feed, or facebook like button. Here the state of the UI component changes on the page, without having to manually refresh when the data is updated. This is just one small, yet powerful feature of React.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThrough a complete hands-on project, this course will teach you all the fundamental principles of React that you must know to become a proficient React developer. We start right from the basics, including the tools needed to get started. From there we dive into JSX, functional components, props, callbacks, and various OnClick events. By this stage, the calculator will have a complete visual display, coupled with functional arithmetic operations. Students then move on to passing parameters in Callback functions, using the React State Hook, and debugging.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn addition to the hands-on React module, we also offer a comprehensive overview of JavaScript for those who need a refresher. Here we start with introducing students to the document object model (DOM) which defines the logical structure of HTML documents. From there we dive into JavaScript to demonstrate various methods in which DOM elements can be manipulated to add interactivity to static components. We start right from the basics, which includes JavaScript placement, and data output. From there we move on to variable declaration, arithmetic operations, operator precedence, data types, and objects. Once the foundations are covered, we move on to more complex operations using Arrays, Conditional Statements, JavaScript comparison operators, booleans and loops. Here students will learn to unleash the true power of JavaScript to render different outcomes based on user interaction. We will explore the use of functions to efficiently handle repetitive tasks and JavaScript events to handle output based on actions and occurrences. The section will conclude with a hands-on project where students will implement their knowledge to build a web based photo gallery and background color changer. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAs you can see this course covers a tremendous bit of ground. Best of all it features Tim Maclachlan - a renowned senior full-stack developer with over 20 years of commercial development experience. As a multi-faceted developer, Tim specializes in algorithmic, analytical and mobile development. To date, he\u2019s written hundreds of applications and worked in a number of industries from commercial aviation and military, to banking and finance.

When a human being ascends the steps of the pyramid, self-actualization is reached. Beyond the routine of needs fulfillment, Maslow envisioned moments of extraordinary experience, known as peak experiences, profound moments of love, understanding, happiness, or rapture, during which a person feels more whole, alive, self-sufficient, and yet a part of the world. This is similar to the flow concept of Mih\u00E1ly Cs\u00EDkszentmih\u00E1lyi. The concept of flow is the idea that after our basic needs are met we can achieve greater happiness by altering our consciousness by becoming so engaged in a task that we lose our sense of time.

He finds that the extent to which a society allows free choice has a major impact on happiness.

pronunciation course, specifically\u003Cstrong\u003E designed to meet the needs of speakers from India\u003C/strong\u003E,\u0026nbsp; you can acquire an American accent by learning to accurately produce the American vowels which Indian speakers of English often confuse. \u0026nbsp;These tricky vowels include learning to distinguish between \u0022peek\u0022 and \u0022pick\u0022 and between \u0022look\u0022 and \u0022Luke.\u0022 \u0026nbsp;Also learn to distinguish between \u0022bone and \u0022born\u0022 and many other troublesome pairs.\u0026nbsp; Confusing these pairs can make you incomprehensible.\u0026nbsp; All of the vowels are organized and presented in a chart so you can learn to compare and contrast each one.\u0026nbsp; Then you\u0027ll learn not to confuse them.\u0026nbsp; Tongue exercises are also given so that you can learn to produce the vowels in an American way, relying more on your tongue and less on other parts of your face. \u0026nbsp;After learning how to make each consonant with simple, every day vocabulary, \u003Cstrong\u003EComputer professionals\u003C/strong\u003E can then learn to reduce or minimize their accents\u0026nbsp;in an \u003Cstrong\u003EIT vocabulary context\u003C/strong\u003E.\u0026nbsp; Sentences will contain the target vowels inside of computer and technology related vocabulary words.\u0026nbsp; Repetition audio practice is included in the downloadable materials so you can repeat the target phrases on the go until the correct pronunciation becomes part of your muscle memory!\u0026nbsp; You can just practice 10 minutes here and there to improve your vowels.\u0026nbsp; You can also attend the instructor\u0027s monthly office hour on Zoom- for free.\u0026nbsp; You can ask questions about what you\u0027re learning in the course and ask the instructor to correct you or check your pronunciation.\u0026nbsp; The instructor is passionate about English and sharing its beauty with others.\u0026nbsp;

Why should we build a sneaker dropshipping business? Among many reasons, here are the main three reasons why you should consider starting a custom sneaker dropshipping business, the first one is the large market size which is approximated to be around 73.7 Billion dollars made this product to be definitely one of the most prospective product that you can sell in today\u2019s market. Meanwhile the second reason why is the fact that sneakers has always been in high demand in the market for all demographics and generations, whether you are millennials, generation Z, upper middle class or even lower middle class, it is very likely that you or your family member at very least have sneakers in your house. Hence, it would be pretty fair to claim that sneakers relatively has wide range of potential customers. Then the third reason has something to do with trends. As we all know, the sneaker trend always changes once in a couple months or even every month for some sneaker brands, therefore, this market behaviour makes it easier to innovate since we can always get inspiration every time a new product is released to the market.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow are things that you will learn from this course:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearning the basic fundamentals of dropshipping and print on demand business model\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGetting to know sneaker print on demand suppliers, such as Printify, Printful, etc\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearning how to perform market research\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearning AI tools that can be used to generate designs for sneaker\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFull step by step tutorial on how to set up and build Shopify store\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFull step by step tutorial on how to set up and build Printify store\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to use Leonardo AI text to image generator to create high quality designs\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to design custom sneakers on Printify\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to connect Printify store with Shopify store\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to add free themes to Shopify store\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn pricing strategies and profit margin analysis\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn marketing strategies to promote sneaker products\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to set up and run Tiktok ads campaign\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to set up and run Facebook ads campaign\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to set up and run Instagram ads campaign\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to set up and run Reddit ads campaign\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/shopify-dropshipping-selling-custom-ai-designed-sneaker/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5370408_d62f.jpg","duration":"5.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"1,083.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["People who are interested in starting dropshipping business","People who are interested in starting print on demand business","People who are interested in designing sneakers using AI tools"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":0,"averageValue":"0.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"Christ Raharja","url":"/user/christ-raharja/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":0}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"1C1BE1BFF99158A2B305","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"\u20B9449","expirationText":"5 hours","discountPercentage":44}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/social-media-marketing-management-secrets-mastery-of-ssm/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5345620,"title":"Social Media Marketing \u0026 Management Secrets | Mastery Of SSM","shortDescription":"Unleashing the Power of Social Media Marketing: Mastering the Secrets of Effective Management and Growth","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to \u0022Social Media Marketing \u0026amp; Management Secrets | Mastery Of SSM,\u0022 where you will embark on a transformative journey to unlock the secrets of effective social media marketing and management.
