Continuous Improvement: Innovation is an ongoing process that requires continuous learning and improvement. Effective management of innovations involves establishing mechanisms for gathering feedback, evaluating performance, and incorporating lessons learned to enhance future innovation efforts.  Overall, the management of innovations is about creating a supportive environment that fosters creativity, experimentation, and collaboration while also providing the structure and guidance needed to translate innovative ideas into tangible outcomes that drive organizational success.","Strategy Development  The importance of strategic thinking and planning cannot be overstated.
