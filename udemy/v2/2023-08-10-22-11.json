For managing applications and databases on a Linux server, one should be familiar with commands such as \u003Cstrong\u003Eapt\u003C/strong\u003E to install applications and \u003Cstrong\u003Esystemctl\u003C/strong\u003E or \u003Cstrong\u003Eservice\u003C/strong\u003E to manage the life cycle of applications and databases. To monitor, one should be familiar with commands such as \u003Cstrong\u003Eps\u003C/strong\u003E, \u003Cstrong\u003Elsof\u003C/strong\u003E, \u003Cstrong\u003Etop\u003C/strong\u003E, etc. You will learn how to monitor and manage applications as well as databases using examples such as \u003Cstrong\u003Essh\u003C/strong\u003E, \u003Cstrong\u003Eapache2\u003C/strong\u003E, \u003Cstrong\u003Emongodb\u003C/strong\u003E, \u003Cstrong\u003Ejupyterlab\u003C/strong\u003E, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs we learned quite a few commands and tools on Linux, now it is time for us to work on increasing productivity by using appropriate tools, especially for Windows users. You will see the relevance and also how to setup tools such as \u003Cstrong\u003Enotepad\u002B\u002B\u003C/strong\u003E, \u003Cstrong\u003Ewinscp\u003C/strong\u003E, \u003Cstrong\u003Evisual studio code with remote development extension\u003C/strong\u003E, \u003Cstrong\u003Egit tools for Windows\u003C/strong\u003E, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrganizations will end up having hundreds of servers to support their applications. However, these hundreds of servers need to follow a handful of templates. Using \u003Cstrong\u003EServer Automation tools like Ansible\u003C/strong\u003E, we should be able to automate the process of configuring a large number of servers using a handful of templates. You will get an \u003Cstrong\u003Eoverview of Ansible\u003C/strong\u003E covering some of the core concepts of Ansible such as \u003Cstrong\u003Erunning commands\u003C/strong\u003E,

This is basically an extensive project based course where you will be guided step by step on how to build a cryptocurrency price tracking website using Wordpress alongside with Cryptocurrency Widgets plugin which is a Wordpress plugin that was specifically designed to create cryptocurrency market price tracker just like Coinmarketcap and Coingecko. In addition, Cryptocurrency Widgets plugin is also supported by CoinGecko API, therefore, the price data that will be displayed on the Wordpress website will be reliable and most up to date data. In the introduction session, you will learn the basic fundamentals of Wordpress and get to know more about Cryptocurrency Widgets which is the plugin that will be utilised in this project. Then, you will also get to know the general overview of the project that we are going to build as well as all features that will be included. Before getting to the main section of the course, you will be guided step by step on how to set up all necessary tools like creating an account on Taste WP which is Wordpress testing platform that we are going to use and also installing the plugin that we need for this project. Once we are ready, you will learn step by step on how to build the crypto price tracker website from scratch, we will go over how to import the price columns and how to change the currency. After the website has been built, we are going to be conducting testing to make sure that the crypto price tracking website has been fully functioning and also easy to use from the user\u2019s perspective. There will be four main testing objectives that will be emphasised in this course, those are functionality testing, user experience testing, compatibility testing, and performance testing. Once the website has been tested and passed all the required criteria, you are going to get to know more about affordable domain and hosting options. Hopefully, this particular section will enable you to make informed decisions about which hosting service you want to use. At the end of the course, you will also learn how to monetise your cryptocurrency price tracking website, we will go over several strategies such as displaying ads, premium ICO, and subscription based model.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, before getting into the course, we need to ask ourselves this question: why should we learn or even build a cryptocurrency price tracking website? Well, there are many answers to that question but in my opinion, cryptocurrency, web 3.0, and blockchain have been growing very rapidly in the past few years, hence, the demand for crypto tracking websites will always be there. If you were thinking about creating the exact clone of Coinmarketcap or Coingecko, then most likely, it will not work since they have already dominated the market a long time even before you started however if you have new creative ideas and try to combine those innovations with crypto price tracker system in your website, I am pretty sure you have a good chance to succeed. Besides crypto, learning how to build and design websites using Wordpress is also a high demand skill to have in today\u2019s market as more and more companies are transforming toward massive scale digitalisation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow are things that you can expect to learn from the course:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearning the basic fundamentals of Wordpress \u0026amp; Cryptocurrency Widgets plugin\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearning how to build Wordpress website using TasteWP\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearning how to create a fully animated cryptocurrency price ticker on Wordpress\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearning how to add cryptocurrency price list with detailed information, such as market cap, supply, transaction volume, etc\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearning how to add multi-currency tabs on Wordpress\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConducting testing on the website with four main testing objectives, those are functionality testing, user experience testing, performance testing, and compatibility testing\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGetting to know more about affordable domain \u0026amp; hosting provider options\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearning how to integrate ads to Wordpress website\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearning how to monetise cryptocurrency price tracking website\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/building-cryptocurrency-price-tracker-website-with-wordpress/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5484248_8459.jpg","duration":"2 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"1,242.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["People who are interested in building cryptocurrency price tracking website","People who are interested in building \u0026 designing Wordpress website"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":0,"averageValue":"0.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"Christ Raharja","url":"/user/christ-raharja/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":0}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"945FC8A4F7FA50B7F8F7","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"\u20B9449","expirationText":"5 hours","discountPercentage":44}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/applied-cryptography-with-python/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5153342,"title":"Applied Cryptography with Python","shortDescription":"Protecting Your Data","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EAre you interested in learning how to use cryptography to protect your data?
