You may also use another spreadsheet software like Google Sheets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearners will learn how to navigate Microsoft Excel as well as how to create a well-designed accounting worksheet, complete with a general journal, trial balance, general ledger, subsidiary ledgers for accounts receivable, accounts payable, \u0026amp; inventory, financial statements and much more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExcel is a very good tool to learn accounting because it is much more transparent than a database program, like accounting software, QuickBooks being a common example of accounting software.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs we enter transactions into our Microsoft Excel worksheet, we will discuss how the data input would commonly be entered into accounting software like QuickBooks and what data input forms would normally drive the transactions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe course will start out from a blank Excel Worksheet. We will build the outline for our accounting system from the blank spreadsheet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor each new step in the process, you will have access to a downloadable Excel Workbook, containing at least two tabs, one with the answer, the new steps being completed, the other starting out where the prior presentation left off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETherefore, you can complete the entire problem starting from one blank spreadsheet, or you can jump forward in the problem and rework any component of the problem by downloading the related worksheet at that point in the process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter constructing the outline of our accounting worksheet, the first section will discuss the most common accounting transactions and the data input form often used in accounting software, like QuickBooks, to enter them, common data input forms including invoice, bill, deposit. . .\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe will then start our comprehensive problem, constructing a new Excel worksheet and entering beginning balances into it, imagining that we had a prior accounting system which we are now converting to our new accounting system in Excel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe will then enter two-months worth of data input. When entering the accounting data we will create the journal entry, post it to the trial balance, giving us a good look at which accounts are impacted, post to the general ledger, and make adjustments to any subsidiary ledgers needed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe will also update the financial statements periodically.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the second month of operations, we create a bit more complex trial balance, allowing us to calculate both the year-to-date numbers, including both months of data input, and the current period numbers, showing income statement accounts for just the second month of operations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter entering two months of data input, we will process two bank reconciliations, using mock bank statements. As we construct our bank reconciliations, we will discuss how accounting software often accomplishes this task.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext, we will adjust our worksheet to enter period end adjusting journal entries as well as reversing entries. For each adjusting entry we will consider the reasons for it and how to set up the accounting system so that our adjusting entries do not mess up the data input process in the accounting department.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter entering the adjusting entries we will construct our financial statements.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/excel-accounting-problem/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4358136_4e8d.jpg","duration":"29 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"69,510.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Anyone who wants to learn Excel, real world practice problems being the best tool","Anybody learning accounting or bookkeeping","Anybody who uses accounting software like QuickBooks and wants to understand what the software is doing","Accounting students and professionals"],"tags":["Accounting"],"rating":{"count":580,"averageValue":"4.6"},"instructors":[{"name":"Robert (Bob) Steele","url":"/user/c91d6786-95f3-48d8-ab94-cc92431d2aa4/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.49}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"6DDC475D5DC1E9EA953E","originalPrice":"\u20B92,499","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"3 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/html-5-with-quizzes-and-python-3-complete-course-2023/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5009916,"title":"HTML 5 With Quizzes And Python 3 Complete Course","shortDescription":"Python 3 : Learn HTML5 with Quizzes, Explore Python Basics and Advanced Concepts in a Comprehensive Python Course","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHTML 5 And Python Complete Course \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E we\u0027ve created thorough, extensive, but easy-to-follow Hours of content that you\u2019ll easily understand and absorb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The course starts with the basics of HTML5, Python fundamentals, programming, and user interaction in full stack course\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe curriculum is going to be very hands-on as we walk you from start to finish to become a professional HTML 5, Python developer.

We\u0027ll explore the essential role of statistics in these domains, setting the stage for our statistical journey.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDecoding Data\u0027s Dual Nature:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EData can be both enlightening and deceptive, a concept beautifully encapsulated by Mark Twain\u0027s famous quote about lies and statistics. Our course aims to equip you with the discernment needed to distinguish between meaningful insights and misleading interpretations. Real-world case studies will be our compass on this enlightening path.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEmpowering Statistical Thinking:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOur primary goal is to empower you with a deep understanding of statistical principles. Probability theory will be a key ally in quantifying uncertainty and making data-informed decisions. Throughout the course, we\u0027ll utilize Excel as a versatile tool to translate theory into practice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConfronting Statistical Challenges:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs we progress, we\u0027ll confront two fundamental statistical challenges. First, comprehensive data analysis involves extracting valuable insights from complete datasets. For example, we might predict future trends in student performance based on historical academic records. Second, statistical inference guides us in making predictions about larger populations based on smaller samples, such as estimating average heights using survey data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECourse Goals:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOur educational journey is enriched with a plethora of real-world examples, illustrating the practicality and wide applicability of statistical analysis.

The CRISPR-Cas9 system consists of two key molecules that introduce a change (mutation) into the DNA. These are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u2981\tan enzyme called Cas9. This acts as a pair of \u2018molecular scissors\u2019 that can cut the two strands of DNA at a specific location in the genome so that bits of DNA can then be added or removed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u2981\ta piece of RNA called guide RNA (gRNA). This consists of a small piece of pre-designed RNA sequence located within a longer RNA scaffold. The scaffold part binds to DNA and the pre-designed sequence \u2018guides\u2019 Cas9 to the right part of the genome. This makes sure that the Cas9 enzyme cuts at the right point in the genome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The guide RNA is designed to find and bind to a specific sequence in the DNA. The guide RNA has RNA bases that are complementary to those of the target DNA sequence in the genome. This means that, at least in theory, the guide RNA will only bind to the target sequence and no other regions of the genome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. The Cas9 follows the guide RNA to the same location in the DNA sequence and makes a cut across both strands of the DNA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. At this stage the cell recognizes that the DNA is damaged and tries to repair it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5.
