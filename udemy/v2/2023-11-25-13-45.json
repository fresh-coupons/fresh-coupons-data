These networks are typically composed of multiple layers of interconnected \u0022neurons\u0022 or \u0022units\u0022, which are simple mathematical functions that process information. The layers in a deep neural network are organized in a hierarchical manner, with lower layers processing basic features and higher layers combining these features to represent more abstract concepts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDeep learning models are trained using large amounts of data and powerful computational resources, such as graphics processing units (GPUs).

Some benefits of the Excel worksheet include the ability to enter adjusting entries in an efficient way and build an adjusted trial balance, the ability to enter tax entries efficiently and build a trial balance on a tax basis, and the ability to reconcile book net income and tax net income. \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAn Excel worksheet can be used to show the difference between net income on the unadjusted trial balance, the adjusted trial balance, and tax trial balance in an easy visual way.

We will provide an updated Excel worksheet for most steps, allowing us to jump forward or to rework any part of the course without starting over. The Excel worksheets will generally have at least two tabs, one with the completed step, showing the end product, and one that has been completed up to the current step in the process, allowing us to fill it in with the help of the instructional video and the Excel tab showing the completed work. \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWe will then practice entering some adjusting entries and tax entries into the worksheet. As we add adjusting and tax entries to the Excel worksheet, we will better understand how the worksheet is formatted and how best to use it.
