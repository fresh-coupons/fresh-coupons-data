First, the smart money buys when the price is low and flat. Then the price goes up, and the weak hands get FOMO (the Fear Of Missing Out). Then the weak hands buy at the top, from the smart money who sells. Then the price goes down, weak hands panic, and sell at the bottom to the smart money who buys. You see the cycle? Only knowledge and good understanding of cryptos and markets will help you shift from being the weak hands to becoming the smart money. And that\u2019s where this course comes into play. It will give you exactly what you need to know and understand to become the smart money.
