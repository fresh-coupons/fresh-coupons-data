From smartphones to wearable fitness trackers, home appliances to industrial machinery and vehicles, these devices are often referred to as \u0022smart\u0022. These devices can communicate with each other and exchange information through IoT, enhancing their functionality and efficiency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA major technological advancement, IoT has a wide variety of applications. Using IoT, healthcare providers can monitor patients remotely, use smart medical devices, and engage in telemedicine, improving patient care and reducing costs. Agriculture can benefit from IoT-based systems by optimizing irrigation, monitoring crop health, and increasing efficiency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESmart homes are among the most notable IoT applications. Lighting, temperature, security systems, and even kitchen appliances can all be controlled remotely with IoT. Energy savings and increased home security are also a result of this connectivity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIoT\u0027s impact on diverse sectors of society only grows as it evolves. Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) will be able to enhance IoT capabilities, enabling more advanced automation and predictive analytics. IoT applications will also be enhanced by higher-speed and more reliable 5G networks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe are only just beginning to realize the potential of the Internet of Things. IoT revolutionizes everything from smart homes to industrial processes. Cybersecurity and data privacy challenges and concerns must be addressed to fully harness its benefits. Moving forward, IoT must be embraced while being implemented responsibly and securely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Internet of Things (IoT) is a revolutionary concept that connects everyday devices to the internet, enabling them to collect and exchange data. IoT programming involves designing applications and software to interact with these interconnected devices. One popular technology for long-range communication in IoT is LoRa (Long Range). It finds its application in various domains like home automation, where smart devices, often powered by ESP8266 or Raspberry Pi, can be controlled remotely for increased convenience and efficiency. In the world of Industrial IoT (IIoT), MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) serves as a lightweight protocol for transmitting data between machines and devices. For enthusiasts and hobbyists, platforms like Raspberry Pi, ESP32, and Arduino offer versatile development environments to build exciting embedded systems, from home automation projects to robotics. These platforms, along with tools like MicroPython and Node-RED, provide flexibility and ease of programming. IoT is driving digital transformation and reshaping business models, making it a crucial component of modern electronics and microcontroller-based solutions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIn this fundamental course, I would like to teach the 5 major topics:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

As an example, manufacturing autonomous vehicles like self-driving cars requires the work of people from different fields, such as AI Researchers, Automotive Engineers, and Computer Vision Researchers.  AI Researchers develop algorithms that enable self-driving cars to perceive their surroundings, make decisions, and control their movements. Automotive Engineers develop the hardware and software systems that are needed to implement these algorithms, and Computer Vision Researchers develop new techniques for enabling self-driving cars to see and understand the world.","What is Machine Learning?  Machine Learning is a type of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that allows computers to learn from data without explicit programming. In other words, machine learning algorithms can recognize patterns and make predictions based on data, without getting a command. This enables computers to learn new tasks and improve their performance over time without human intervention.","Where is Machine Learning used?  Machine learning is in use by a wide range of applications, including email filtering, Social Media Personalization, Image Recognition, Speech Recognition, fraud detection, Text prediction, Product recommendation, medical diagnosis, Healthcare Personalization, Traffic Prediction.","Neural networks are a type of machine learning algorithm that is inspired by the structure and function of the human brain.  Neural networks can learn complex patterns from data.  Neural networks have been successfully used in areas such as natural language processing.","Deep Learning is a type of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers.  Each layer consists of multiple nodes that can perform diverse tasks. This allows deep learning models to learn more complex patterns from data.  Deep learning has been used to achieve significant results in a wide range of tasks, including image recognition, speech recognition, and machine translation."],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":68,"averageValue":"4.2"},"instructors":[{"name":"MTF Institute of Management, Technology and Finance","url":"/user/mtfinstitute/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.257353}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"23C46350E7B61D4EC592","originalPrice":"\u20B93,499","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"1 day","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/adobe-illustrator-course-for-beginner/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5182936,"title":"Adobe Illustrator Course For Beginner","shortDescription":"Learn Use of Tools for Graphics Design","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EAre you looking to learn Adobe Illustrator from the beginning?
