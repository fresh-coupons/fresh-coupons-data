We start right from the basics, where we explore the Lightroom interface and creating an image catalog. From there students learn to configure catalog settings while using the import dialog and import file handling. In this section students also learn to work with metadata presets, and preferences related to import options. Once students have a handle on the foundations, the course takes an in-depth look into file formats and color space. Here, we demonstrate the importance of understanding various image compression types and the quality vs size trade off. We discuss RAW vs JPEG vs TIFF files, along with color space comparisons between sRGB, RGB and CMYK. Students also learn the concept of image resolution and the importance of pixel density in determining image quality.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn section three, we complete our overview of the Lightroom interface by showcasing a few more essential features. This includes a number of file handling options, interface preferences, identity plate configuration, and watermarking.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOnce students have a firm handle on the foundations, the course transitions into exploring the Lightroom slideshow module. Here, students learn how to navigate the slideshow interface and create stunning slideshows from image collections using various slideshow templates. We also cover a number of tools to spruce up the overall look of a slideshow using text overlays, and embedded media objects such as music and video. Lastly, students will learn how to export a slideshow using various file formats and compression options. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAfter completion of the slideshow module, we dive into the print module. Here students will learn how to navigate the print module interface and setup print templates to produce studio quality images on both home and commercial grade printers. Students will learn important concepts such as soft proofing, page setup, layout style, custom templates, and print job configuration. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe last section of the course provides a quick guide to publishing image collections to the web, using the Lightroom Web module. We start with an overview of the interface before exploring various layout options and the color palette. We then move on to the appearance panel, and output configuration before demonstrating how to publish the gallery using various web file formats. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAs you can see this course covers a number of topics that are essential to anyone starting off with Lightroom. It\u2019s also a great resource for both professional and aspiring photographers that are looking to take their existing photos to the next level.
