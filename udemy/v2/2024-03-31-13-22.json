Management of innovations refers to the strategic planning, implementation, and oversight of processes and practices aimed at fostering innovation within an organization. It involves the systematic handling of new ideas, technologies, products, or processes from conception to implementation, with the goal of driving growth, competitiveness, and long-term success.  Key components of managing innovations include:  Strategic Planning: Effective management of innovations begins with strategic planning that aligns innovation efforts with the overall goals and objectives of the organization. This involves identifying areas for innovation, setting clear objectives, and allocating resources strategically.  Idea Generation and Screening: The management of innovations involves generating ideas for new products, services, or processes through brainstorming sessions, market research, or collaboration with stakeholders. These ideas are then screened and evaluated based on criteria such as feasibility, market potential, and alignment with organizational goals.  Resource Allocation: Allocating resources, including financial, human, and technological resources, is a critical aspect of managing innovations. This involves making decisions about how to allocate resources effectively to support innovation initiatives while balancing competing priorities.  Risk Management: Innovation inherently involves risks, including financial risks, technical risks, and market risks. Effective management of innovations requires identifying and assessing these risks and implementing strategies to mitigate them. This may involve conducting risk assessments, scenario planning, or developing contingency plans.  Cross-functional Collaboration: Managing innovations often requires collaboration across different departments or functional areas within an organization. Cross-functional teams bring together diverse perspectives and expertise to tackle complex innovation challenges and drive implementation.","Prototyping and Testing: Before bringing a new product or service to market, it\u0027s essential to prototype and test ideas to gather feedback and identify potential issues. The management of innovations involves overseeing the prototyping and testing process and using insights gained to refine and improve the innovation.  Intellectual Property Management: Protecting intellectual property is crucial for organizations investing in innovation. This involves managing patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets to ensure that the organization can capitalize on its innovations and maintain a competitive advantage.  Continuous Improvement: Innovation is an ongoing process that requires continuous learning and improvement. Effective management of innovations involves establishing mechanisms for gathering feedback, evaluating performance, and incorporating lessons learned to enhance future innovation efforts.  Overall, the management of innovations is about creating a supportive environment that fosters creativity, experimentation, and collaboration while also providing the structure and guidance needed to translate innovative ideas into tangible outcomes that drive organizational success.","Corporate entrepreneurship, also known as intrapreneurship, refers to the process of developing and implementing new ideas and innovations within an established organization.

Course for any who want to build a career at Web3 or improve their knowledge.","Web3 refers to the next generation of the internet, often referred to as the decentralized web. It is envisioned as a more transparent, secure, and user-centric version of the internet, enabled by blockchain technology and decentralized protocols. In Web3, users have more control over their data and digital identities, and intermediaries such as centralized platforms are minimized or eliminated. This decentralized architecture offers various benefits such as increased privacy, censorship resistance, and the ability to create trustless interactions through smart contracts.","NFT stands for Non-Fungible Token. NFTs are unique digital assets that represent ownership or proof of authenticity of a particular item or piece of content, typically stored on a blockchain. Unlike cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, which are fungible and can be exchanged on a one-to-one basis, NFTs are indivisible and cannot be exchanged on a like-for-like basis due to their unique attributes. NFTs have gained significant attention in recent years, especially in the realms of digital art, collectibles, gaming, and virtual real estate, as they provide a way to establish scarcity and ownership in the digital world.","Learning about Web3 and NFTs is important for companies and managers for several reasons:  Understanding Emerging Technologies: Web3 and NFTs represent significant shifts in how we interact with the internet and digital assets. By staying informed about these technologies, companies and managers can anticipate trends and adapt their strategies accordingly.  New Business Opportunities: Web3 and NFTs open up new avenues for innovation and revenue generation. Companies that embrace these technologies can explore novel business models, such as decentralized finance (DeFi), tokenized assets, and digital collectibles.  Enhanced Customer Engagement: NFTs enable unique and personalized experiences for customers, whether through digital art, exclusive content, or virtual goods. By leveraging NFTs, companies can deepen customer engagement and foster a sense of community around their brand.","Mitigating Risks: As blockchain technology becomes more prevalent, understanding its implications becomes crucial for risk management. Companies need to grasp the security and regulatory considerations associated with Web3 and NFTs to protect their assets and reputation.  Developing skills in Web3 and NFTs can support career advancement or the launch of a business in several ways:  Technical Proficiency: Learning blockchain development, smart contract programming, and NFT standards (such as ERC-721 or ERC-1155) can open up opportunities for technical roles in blockchain-focused companies or projects.","Entrepreneurial Ventures: Individuals with expertise in Web3 and NFTs can capitalize on the growing demand for blockchain-based solutions by starting their own businesses. This could involve creating NFT marketplaces, developing blockchain games, or providing consultancy services to companies exploring blockchain integration.  Strategic Leadership: Managers who understand the potential of Web3 and NFTs can drive innovation within their organizations and guide strategic decisions related to blockchain adoption. This may involve identifying use cases, forming partnerships with blockchain startups, or implementing pilot projects to test new ideas.  Personal Branding: Building a reputation as a thought leader or expert in Web3 and NFTs can enhance career prospects and attract opportunities for speaking engagements, advisory roles, or partnerships.  In conclusion, learning about Web3 and NFTs is essential for companies and managers to stay competitive in a rapidly evolving digital landscape. By embracing these technologies and developing relevant skills, individuals can position themselves for career growth and entrepreneurial success in the blockchain industry."],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":8,"averageValue":"4.2"},"instructors":[{"name":"MTF Institute of Management, Technology and Finance","url":"/user/mtfinstitute/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.0625}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"9558132040A9F9F0808F","originalPrice":"\u20B93,499","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/professional-diploma-in-advertising-and-public-relations/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5806940,"title":"Professional Diploma in Advertising and Public Relations","shortDescription":"Professional Diploma in Advertising and Public Relations by MTF Institute","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003ECourse provided by \u003Cstrong\u003EMTF Institute of Management, Technology and Finance\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMTF\u003C/strong\u003E is the global educational and research institute with HQ at Lisbon, Portugal, focused on business \u0026amp; professional hybrid (on-campus and online) education at areas: Business \u0026amp; Administration, Science \u0026amp; Technology, Banking \u0026amp; Finance. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMTF R\u0026amp;D \u003C/strong\u003Ecenter focused on research activities at areas: Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Data Science, Big Data, WEB3, Blockchain, Cryptocurrency \u0026amp; Digital Assets, Metaverses, Digital Transformation, Fintech, Electronic Commerce, Internet of Things. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMTF\u003C/strong\u003E is the official partner of: IBM, Intel, Microsoft, member of the Portuguese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and resident of the incubator \u0022The Fintech House of Portugal\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMTF \u003C/strong\u003Eis present in 208 countries and has been chosen by more than 380,000 students.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPublic Relations (PR) i\u003C/strong\u003Es a strategic communication process that organizations, individuals, or brands use to build and maintain positive relationships with their target audience, stakeholders, and the public.

In some cases, a manager may be the primary source of support for an employee, especially when they are facing personal challenges or seeking guidance related to their mental health and well-being.  Coaching methods are not limited to career development; they encompass the whole spectrum of an employee\u0027s life. Effective managers create an environment where team members feel comfortable discussing personal challenges and seeking guidance when needed. This trust and openness are essential for maintaining employee well-being.  In situations where employees are dealing with stress, anxiety, or other mental health issues, managers with coaching skills can provide valuable support. They can listen empathetically, offer guidance on stress management techniques, and help employees access appropriate resources for professional help when necessary.","Coaching for Life Questions and Personal Challenges  Life is filled with complexities, and employees often grapple with personal challenges that can affect their work performance and overall well-being. Managers who are skilled in coaching can offer valuable guidance during these times of need.  One area where coaching is particularly beneficial is work-life balance. In today\u0027s fast-paced world, employees often struggle to juggle their professional and personal responsibilities. Managers can use coaching techniques to help team members set boundaries, manage their time effectively, and achieve a healthier work-life balance.  Coaching also proves invaluable in navigating interpersonal relationships, both within and outside the workplace. Managers can offer insights into effective communication, conflict resolution, and building positive relationships, which can significantly impact an employee\u0027s overall quality of life.  In times of personal crisis or uncertainty, such as major life transitions or unexpected challenges, employees may turn to their managers for guidance. Managers trained in coaching can provide a supportive and non-judgmental space for employees to explore their feelings, identify potential solutions, and develop action plans to address these challenges.","coaching techniques have become indispensable in the modern workplace, particularly within the roles of managers and leaders. These skills not only drive career development and internal education but also play a crucial role in supporting the mental health and well-being of employees.  As we navigate an ever-changing professional landscape, organizations that recognize the importance of coaching will not only foster a culture of continuous improvement but also cultivate a loyal and motivated workforce. Managers who embrace coaching as a core aspect of their leadership style will not only elevate their own careers but also become catalysts for the success of their teams and organizations as a whole.  By understanding and implementing coaching techniques effectively, managers can truly transform the workplace into an environment where individuals thrive, careers flourish, and holistic well-being is nurtured."],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":26,"averageValue":"4.5"},"instructors":[{"name":"MTF Institute of Management, Technology and Finance","url":"/user/mtfinstitute/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.5384617}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"10627CE0834B30296497","originalPrice":"\u20B93,499","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/professional-diploma-of-real-estate-business-expert/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5871066,"title":"Professional Diploma of Real Estate Business Expert","shortDescription":"Professional Diploma of Real Estate Business Expert by MTF Institute","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWelcome to course\u003C/strong\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003EProfessional Diploma of Real Estate Business Expert by MTF Institute\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECourse provided by \u003Cstrong\u003EMTF Institute of Management, Technology and Finance\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMTF\u003C/strong\u003E is the global educational and research institute with HQ at Lisbon, Portugal, focused on business \u0026amp; professional hybrid (on-campus and online) education at areas: Business \u0026amp; Administration, Science \u0026amp; Technology, Banking \u0026amp; Finance. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMTF R\u0026amp;D \u003C/strong\u003Ecenter focused on research activities at areas: Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Data Science, Big Data, WEB3, Blockchain, Cryptocurrency \u0026amp; Digital Assets, Metaverses, Digital Transformation, Fintech, Electronic Commerce, Internet of Things. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMTF\u003C/strong\u003E is the official partner of: IBM, Intel, Microsoft, member of the Portuguese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and resident of the incubator \u0022The Fintech House of Portugal\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMTF \u003C/strong\u003Eis present in 208 countries and has been chosen by more than 380,000 students.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECourse Author: Igor Dmitriev\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMortgage and Real Estate Ecosystems Expert and ex Head of Business line at Societe Generale Global banking group\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDigital Transformation and Banking Expert\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEducation:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMBA, The Boston University\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster of Science at Engineering (Technical) Management,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe State University of New York at Buffalo\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster of Science at Informatics and Economics,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESix Sigma Black Belt\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EExperience:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExpert at Banking (\u0026gt; 18 years), FinTech \u0026amp; Digital (\u0026gt; 15 years),\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExperienced Manager (\u0026gt; 14 years) with successful track of records\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eat personal and corporate entrepreneurship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore than 12 years at worldwide banking groups such us\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESociete Generale , Raiffeisenbank\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExperience at roles: CEO, Head of Business, Chief Digital \u0026amp;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMarketing Officer, Head of Digital Transformation and Channels, Head of Products and Marketing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat is the Real Estate Business?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe real estate business encompasses all activities related to the buying, selling, renting, development, and management of land and buildings.

The World Wide Web Consortium\u0027s XML 1.0 Specification of 1998 and several other related specifications - all of them free open standards - define XML. The design goals of XML emphasize simplicity, generality, and usability across the Internet. It is a textual data format with strong support via Unicode for different human languages. Although the design of XML focuses on documents, the language is widely used for the representation of arbitrary data structures such as those used in web services. Several schema systems exist to aid in the definition of XML-based languages, while programmers have developed many application programming interfaces (APIs) to aid the processing of XML data.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u0022\u003Cstrong\u003EXSD\u003C/strong\u003E (\u003Cstrong\u003EXML Schema Definition\u003C/strong\u003E), a recommendation of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), specifies how to formally describe the elements in an Extensible Markup Language (XML) document. It can be used by programmers to verify each piece of item content in a document. They can check if it adheres to the description of the element it is placed in. Like all XML schema languages, XSD can be used to express a set of rules to which an XML document must conform in order to be considered \u0022valid\u0022 according to that schema. However, unlike most other schema languages, XSD was also designed with the intent that determination of a document\u0027s validity would produce a collection of information adhering to specific data types. Such a post-validation \u003Cem\u003Einfoset\u003C/em\u003E can be useful in the development of XML document processing software.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat you\u0027ll learn from this course:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E- You will learn all the theory about how to use XML language correctly, as well as all about its general and specific syntaxes, according to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) official recommendations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- You will learn all the practice about how to code your XML files, using the elements, attributes and types - default and custom ones - from the referred XSD schemas, as well as how to test the correctness and validation of your XML instances against their referred XSD docs using Eclipse IDE automation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- You will adventure into the complete theory background about how to create your own XSD schema documents and master the details about XSD general and specific syntaxes, according to W3C official specifications.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- You will practice, through tens of examples, how to code your own XSD files, using the 3 design methods suggested by W3C, as well as how to take advantage of all main base elements, attributes and types (default W3C library/namespace) to create your own personalized XML/XSD components.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- You will have pretty clear what default and custom namespaces are, as well as prefixes, both at the XML instances as at the XSD documents. You\u0027ll learn how to import and include multiple XSD documents into one same XSD and also how to refer to multiple XSD documents from one same XML instance, nice and easy... even using your own personal brand as the prefix for customizing your code (in my case: danielpm1982).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- All this course\u0027s theory, as well as the good practices and techniques used, are based on the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and W3Schools contents, here with much better and complete explanations and practical examples.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- After doing this course, you\u0027ll understand much easier all the document types used at Web Services development, or any other application that uses XML and XSD (or WSDL).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- All source codes are available at my GitHub, as well as attached to each practice lecture, as a zip file. You can easily download, study, reuse and test them yourself, for learning purposes, and even create much better examples. This is how you learn: starting from the basics and evolving, through practicing, until proficiency. All at your own pace and time and re-watching any lecture as many times as you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Additional content, as WSDL and JSON theory and practical lectures, as well as lectures with sample Web Services projects, demonstrating the real world applicability of XML, XSD, WSDL and JSON, will be added incrementally within the next months, at this same course. But you can finish this course with the current content, as it is, and receive your Udemy Certification on that\u2026 and if you want, you may return later, watch the future extra content lectures (WSDL and JSON) and, at the end, receive another Udemy Certification with the updated content and course name. All students will be notified when any future content is added.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- This course is already composed of more than 10 hours, a workload greater than almost all other same-topic courses at Udemy.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPrerequisites:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E- If you wanna practice, you should have Eclipse IDE installed on your PC or notebook. But you can just watch the theory and practical lectures, at any device with internet access, in case you have no computer available at that moment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- No programming languages or frameworks are required for this course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- No silly or useless tests will be imposed onto you.

All related links, with W3C content, are attached to each theory lecture description.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat\u0027s the difference between taking this course and simply viewing W3Schools material at their own site ?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/strong\u003EAlthough the content is almost entirely referenced on W3C publications, this course offers much better, organized and understandable explanations about the content, and also a much greater set of examples, using Eclipse IDE, from the easiest to the most complex ones. At W3Schools site, for instance, you only find very simple snippets of code.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat\u0027s the difference between taking this course and the other XML/XSD courses at Udemy ?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E- No objection at all to those who may take more than one course. But this one has an innovative methodology, is more organized and complete (over 10 hours of theory and practices already), as well as it has much better examples, explained step by step, without any hurried 2-3 min lectures. It covers IN FULL everything that W3C suggests about XML and XSD.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- This course is organized similar to university or college lectures, with an average of 1h per lecture. The organization is oriented towards the content itself and not short time limited lectures. I think prioritizing the content on the curriculum organization contributes way better to cohesiveness as well as to the organization and consolidation of the content in anyone\u0027s brain. 2-3 min classes end up being a big confusion resulted from a too high fragmentation level of the content. Students always criticize on other courses that everything\u0027s too hastily delivered, as if the students already knew the subjects. Here, and differently from that, you\u0027ll see it\u0027s all nicely and easily delivered, and you won\u0027t get lost on the content, even if you never heard about XML or any structural or programming language before. You\u0027re free, though, to plan your own individual learning schedule. Just take note of the subject you last saw, and then continue from there when you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Finally, this course is divided into Theory and Practice lectures. You\u0027ll, thus, have multiple chances, from multiple explanation perspectives, to learn or complement the acknowledging of each topic, subtopics, practices, and so on. And, of course, at your own time, pace and individual needs. The access to this course will be forever yours (it doesn\u0027t expire) and you\u0027ll be able to review any lecture as much as you want. A big advantage of e-learning recorded lectures compared to live face-to-face attendance lectures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWelcome to the course !!

Merger: Two companies of relatively similar size combine forces to create a new, single entity. This is often a move for market expansion or gaining a competitive edge.  Acquisition: One company purchases a majority stake or all of another company. The acquiring company gains control of the acquired company\u0027s assets and operations. This can be done to enter new markets, eliminate competition, or gain new technology resources.","Key Pitfalls in M\u0026A  Culture Clash: Combining distinct company cultures can lead to employee conflicts, low morale, and a decline in productivity.  Overpaying: Enthusiasm can lead companies to overpay for an acquisition, resulting in financial losses down the line.  Poor Integration: Failure to smoothly integrate systems, processes, and teams creates operational chaos and hinders the potential of the combined entity.  Lack of Due Diligence: Insufficient research about the target company\u0027s financial health, legal standing, or market position might expose hidden liabilities and risks.  Loss of Focus: The complexity of the M\u0026A process can distract from core business operations, leading to neglected customers or missed opportunities.","Why is Learning About M\u0026A Important for Companies and Managers?  Strategic Growth: M\u0026A can be a powerful tool to expand into new markets, acquire new technologies, eliminate competitors, or increase market share significantly.  Responding to Market Changes Companies must adapt to industry shifts. An M\u0026A strategy can be vital for staying ahead of the competition or even surviving.  Leadership Development: M\u0026A success relies heavily on the ability of managers to navigate complexity, integrate teams, and make crucial decisions under pressure.","How Can M\u0026A Skills Support Career Development?  Increased Demand: As M\u0026A activity continues to be prevalent, professionals with these skills are highly sought after by companies, investment banks, and consulting firms.  Leadership Opportunities: M\u0026A skills signal strategic thinking, problem-solving abilities, and a talent for execution \u2013 all assets for leadership roles.  Broader Skillset: M\u0026A involves exposure to various aspects of business such as finance, valuation, negotiation, and legal, thus developing a more versatile skillset.

Furthermore, if a company offers such credit to the customer, there\u2019s the same risk that the customer will not pay back. It also incorporates other related risks, such as that the bond issuer may not make payment at the time of maturity and the risk occurring out of the incapacity of the insurance company to compensate for the claim. A higher level of credit risk in a profitable market will correlate with the elevated borrowing cost. Because of this, it is evaluated technically to mitigate such risk to a certain level.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe will start with a brief introduction to measures of credit risk modeling.

The term digital forensics was originally used as a synonym for \u003Cstrong\u003Ecomputer forensics\u003C/strong\u003E but has expanded to cover investigation of all devices capable of storing digital data. With roots in the personal computing revolution of the late 1970s and early 1980s, the discipline evolved in a haphazard manner during the 1990s, and it was not until the early 21st century that national policies emerged.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDigital forensics investigations have a variety of applications. The most common is to support or refute a hypothesis before criminal or civil courts. Criminal cases involve the alleged breaking of laws that are defined by legislation and that are enforced by the police and prosecuted by the state, such as theft and assault against the person. Civil cases on the other hand deal with protecting the rights and property of individuals (often associated with family disputes) but may also be concerned with contractual disputes between commercial entities where a form of digital forensics referred to as electronic discovery (discovery) may be involved\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring the 1980s very few specialized digital forensic tools existed, and consequently investigators often performed live analysis on media, examining computers from within the operating system using existing sysadmin tools to extract evidence. This practice carried the risk of modifying data on the disk, either inadvertently or otherwise, which led to claims of evidence tampering. A number of tools were created during the early 1990s to address the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDigital forensics is commonly used in both criminal law and private investigation. Traditionally it has been associated with criminal law, where evidence is collected to support or oppose a hypothesis before the courts. As with other areas of forensics this is often a part of a wider investigation spanning a number of disciplines. In some cases, the collected evidence is used as a form of intelligence gathering, used for other purposes than court proceedings (for example to locate, identify or halt other crimes). As a result, intelligence gathering is sometimes held to a less strict forensic standard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you enroll in our Digital Forensics Masterclass | Forensic Science 2023 DFMC, you\u0027ll not only learn about the fundamentals of digital forensics, but so much more!

An ethical hacker is also sometimes referred to as a white hat hacker. Many depend on ethical hackers to identify weaknesses in their networks, endpoints, devices, or applications. The hacker informs their client as to when they will be attacking the system, as well as the scope of the attack. Ethical hacker operates within the confines of their agreement with their client. They cannot work to discover vulnerabilities and then payment to fix them. This is what gray hat hackers do. Ethical hackers are also different from black hat hackers, who hack to harm others or benefit themselves without permission.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003EIs Ethical Hacking a good career?\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EYes, ethical hacking is a good career because it is one of the best ways to test a network. An ethical hacker tries to locate vulnerabilities in the network by testing different hacking techniques on them. In many situations, a network seems impenetrable only because it hasn\u2019t succumbed to an attack in years. However, this could be because black hat hackers are using the wrong kinds of methods. An ethical hacker can show a company how it may be vulnerable by levying a new type of attack that no one has ever tried before. When they successfully penetrate the system, the organization can then set up defenses to protect against this kind of penetration. This unique security opportunity makes the skills of an ethical hacker desirable for organizations that want to ensure their systems are well-defended against cyber criminals.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWhat skills do Ethical Hackers need to know?\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn addition to proficiency in basic computer skills and use of the command line, ethical hackers must also develop technical skills related to programming, database management systems (DBMS), use of the Linux operating system (OS), cryptography, creation and management of web applications and computer networks like DHCP, NAT, and Subnetting. Becoming an ethical hacker involves learning at least one programming language and having a working knowledge of other common languages like Python, SQL, C\u002B\u002B, and C. Ethical hackers must have strong problem-solving skills and the ability to think critically to come up with and test new solutions for securing systems. Ethical hackers should also understand how to use reverse engineering to uncover specifications and check a system for vulnerabilities by analyzing its code.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWhy do hackers use Linux?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003EMany hackers use the Linux operating system (OS) because Linux is a free and open-source OS, meaning that anyone can modify it. It\u2019s easy to access and customize all parts of Linux, which allows a hacker more control over manipulating the OS. Linux also features a well-integrated command-line interface, giving users a more precise level of control than many other systems offer. While Linux is considered more secure than many other systems, some hackers can modify existing Linux security distributions to use them as hacking software. Most ethical hackers prefer Linux because it\u0027s considered more secure than other operating systems and does not generally require the use of third-party antivirus software. Ethical hackers must be well-versed in Linux to identify loopholes and combat malicious hackers, as it\u2019s one of the most popular systems for web servers.\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EIs Ethical Hacking Legal?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003EYes, ethical hacking is legal because the hacker has full, expressed permission to test the vulnerabilities of a system. An ethical hacker operates within constraints stipulated by the person or organization for which they work, and this agreement makes for a legal arrangement. An ethical hacker is like someone who handles quality control for a car manufacturer. They may have to try to break certain components of the vehicle such as the windshield, suspension system, transmission, or engine to see where they are weak or how they can improve them. With ethical hacking, the hacker is trying to \u201Cbreak\u201D the system to ascertain how it can be less vulnerable to cyberattacks. However, if an ethical hacker attacks an area of a network or computer without getting expressed permission from the owner, they could be considered a gray hat hacker, violating ethical hacking principles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EWhat is the Certified Ethical Hacker ( CEH ) Certification Exam?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003EThe Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) certification exam supports and tests the knowledge of auditors, security officers, site administrators, security professionals, and anyone else who wants to ensure a network is safe against cyber criminals. With the CEH credential, you can design and govern the minimum standards necessary for credentialing information that security professionals need to engage in ethical hacking. You can also make it known to the public if someone who has earned their CEH credentials has met or exceeded the minimum standards. You are also empowered to reinforce the usefulness and self-regulated nature of ethical hacking. The CEH exam doesn\u2019t cater to specific security hardware or software vendors, such as Fortinet, Avira, Kaspersky, Cisco, or others, making it a vendor-neutral program.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWhat is the Certified Information Security Manager ( CISM ) exam?\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EPassing the Certified Information Security Manager (CISM) exam indicates that the credentialed individual is an expert in the governance of information security, developing security programs and managing them, as well as managing incidents and risks. For someone to be considered \u201Ccertified,\u201D they must have passed the exam within the last five years, as well as work full-time in a related career, such as information security and IT administration. The exam tests individuals\u2019 knowledge regarding the risks facing different systems, how to develop programs to assess and mitigate these risks, and how to ensure an organization\u0027s information systems conform to internal and regulatory policies. The exam also assesses how a person can use tools to help an organization recover from a successful attack.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EWhat are the different types of hackers?\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe different types of hackers include white hat hackers who are ethical hackers and are authorized to hack systems, black hat hackers who are cyber criminals, and grey hat hackers, who fall in-between and may not damage your system but hack for personal gain. There are also red hat hackers who attack black hat hackers directly. Some call new hackers green hat hackers. These people aspire to be full-blown, respected hackers. State-sponsored hackers work for countries and hacktivists and use hacking to support or promote a philosophy. Sometimes a hacker can act as a whistleblower, hacking their organization to expose hidden practices. There are also script kiddies and blue hat hackers. A script kiddie tries to impress their friends by launching scripts and downloading tools to take down websites and networks.

Ethical hackers and security experts carry out these tests to find any weak spots in a system\u2019s security before hackers with malicious intent find them and exploit them. Someone who has no previous knowledge of the system\u0027s security usually performs these tests, making it easier to find vulnerabilities that the development team may have overlooked. You can perform penetration testing using manual or automated technologies to compromise servers, web applications, wireless networks, network devices, mobile devices, and other exposure points.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat are the different types of penetration testing?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThere are many types of penetration testing. Internal penetration testing tests an enterprise\u0027s internal network. This test can determine how much damage can be caused by an employee. An external penetration test targets a company\u0027s externally facing technology like its website or its network. Companies use these tests to determine how an anonymous hacker can attack a system. In a covert penetration test, also known as a double-blind penetration test, few people in the company will know that a pen test is occurring, including any security professional. This type of test will test not only systems but a company\u0027s response to an active attack. With a closed-box penetration test, a hacker may know nothing about the enterprise under attack other than its name. In an open-box test, the hacker will receive some information about a company\u0027s security to aid them in the attack.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWhat are the different stages of penetration testing?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EPenetration tests have five different stages. The first stage defines the goals and scope of the test and the testing methods that will be used. Security experts will also gather intelligence on the company\u0027s system to better understand the target. The second stage of a pen test is scanning the target application or network to determine how it will respond to an attack. You can do this through a static analysis of application code and dynamic scans of running applications and networks. The third stage is the attack phase when possible vulnerabilities discovered in the last stage are attacked with various hacking methods. In the fourth stage of a penetration test, the tester attempts to maintain access to the system to steal any sensitive data or damage systems. The fifth and final stage of a pen test is the reporting phase when testers compile the test results.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003ENo Previous Knowledge is needed!\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou don\u2019t need to have previous knowledge about all. \u003Cstrong\u003EThis course will take you from a beginner to a more advanced level with hands-on examples.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003ELearn the famous hacking framework Metasploit\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe will start with the very basics.

What can lead to sudden rating change\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECreditors use a credit score rating scale to assess an individual\u2019s creditworthiness, i.e., a person\u2019s likelihood of whether the company can pay the debt obligation fully on time. Different credit rating agencies provide credit ratings. A rating is given to any issuer, i.e., an individual, corporate, state, or sovereign government seeking to borrow the money. The rating does not say whether an investor should really buy that bond, but it is just one of the most important parameters an investor should consider before investing in any bond. A rating suggests both the present situation and the impact of future events on credit risk. Credit ratings are not constant. They keep changing from time to time as the credit quality of an issue or issuer alters in ways that were not expected when a rating was assigned. For example, consider a new technology that was not expected, which was not considered while assigning a rating to a company. This new technology might lead to a negative impact on the financials of the company. This may impact the downgrading of the current rating. \u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/credit-ratings-of-banks-beginners-course/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5773564_6915.jpg","duration":"43 total mins","enrolledStudentsCount":"1,874.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Financial Risk Managers, Credit Managers/Credit Analyst, Credit Portfolio Managers, Asset Managers, Investment professionals, Students who want to pursue their career in any of the above fields"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":0,"averageValue":"0.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"EDUCBA Bridging the Gap","url":"/user/premananda-suna/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":0}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"EDUCBA7221912","originalPrice":"\u20B93,499","discountedPrice":"\u20B9449","expirationText":"5 hours","discountPercentage":87}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/toefl-preparation-speak-english-with-confidence/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5774612,"title":"TOEFL Preparation: Speak English with Confidence","shortDescription":"Speak Clearly, Score Bravely in TOEFL!","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to course: TOEFL Preparation: Speak English with Confidence\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECourse description\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022TOEFL Preparation: Speak with Confidence \u0022 is designed to empower aspiring TOEFL candidates with the skills, confidence, and strategies needed to excel in the Speaking section of the TOEFL exam.
