Either you are preparing yourself to enter into the field of automotive service, or you are expanding your skills to include automotive electrical systems. In either case, congratulations on selecting one of the most fast-paced segments of the automotive industry. Working with the electrical systems can be challenging, yet very rewarding; however, it can also be very frustrating at times. For many people, learning electrical systems can be a struggle. It is my hope that I am able to present the course to you in such a manner that you will not only understand electrical systems, but will excel at it. There are many ways the theory of electricity can be explained, and many metaphors can be used. Some compare electricity to a water flow, while others explain it in a purely scientific fashion. Everyone learns differently. I am presenting electrical theory in a manner that I hope will be clear and concise. If you do not fully comprehend a concept, then it is important to discuss it with your instructor. Electricity is somewhat abstract; so if you do have questions, be sure to ask me in Udemy ask section.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy Become an Electrical System Technician? \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the past, it was possible for technicians to work their entire careers and be able to almost completely avoid the vehicle\u2019s electrical systems. They would specialize in engines, steering/ suspension, or brakes. Today, there is not a system on the vehicle that is immune to the role of electrical circuits. Engine controls, electronic suspension systems, and anti-lock brakes are common on today\u2019s vehicles. Even electrical systems that were once thought of as being simple have evolved to computer controls. Headlights are now pulse-width modulated using high side drivers and will automatically brighten and dim based on the light intensity of oncoming traffic. Today\u2019s vehicles are equipped with twenty or more computers, laser-guided cruise control, sonar park assist, infrared climate control, fiber optics, and radio frequency transponders and decoders. Simple systems have become more computers reliant. For example, the horn circuit on the 2008 Chrysler 300C involves three separate control modules to function. Even the tires have computers involved, with the addition of tire pressure monitoring systems!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday\u2019s technician must possess a full and complete electrical background to be able to succeed.

Whenever they dismantle something, they can reassemble it how it was. Whenever they say that they need to investigate the hood, they can really get the darn thing open. Furthermore, when they need to change a level, they don\u0027t endure ten minutes attempting to sort out which end of the raise is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFortunately, you don\u0027t need to be brought into the world with a wrench in your grasp to know how to fix things \u2014 even things as apparently convoluted as a vehicle.

You will also explore strategies for app monetization, including in-app purchases\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven though Kotlin is a full-fledged functional programming language, it preserves most of the object-oriented nature of Java as an alternative programming style, which is very handy when converting existing Java code. Kotlin has classes with constructors, along with nested, inner, and anonymous inner classes, and it has interfaces like Java 8. Kotlin does \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E have a new keyword. To create a class instance, call the constructor just like a regular function. We saw that in the screenshot above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKotlin has single inheritance from a named superclass, and all Kotlin classes have a default superclass Any, which is \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E the same as the Java base class java.lang.Object. Any contains only three predefined member functions: equals(), hashCode(), and toString().\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKotlin classes have to be marked with the open keyword in order to allow other classes to inherit from them; Java classes are kind of the opposite, as they are inheritable \u003Cem\u003Eunless\u003C/em\u003E marked with the final keyword. To override a superclass method, the method itself must be marked open, and the subclass method must be marked override. This is all of a piece with Kotlin\u2019s philosophy of making things explicit rather than relying on defaults. In this particular case, I can see where Kotlin\u2019s way of explicitly marking base class members as open for inheritance and derived class members as overrides avoids several kinds of common Java errors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, you\u0027ll learn how to create apps and run them on virtual devices through guided exercises.

Progressing through the chapters and lectures, you\u0027ll delve into Android\u0027s RecyclerView to make the most of displaying lists of data and become comfortable with fetching data from a web service and handling images. You\u0027ll then learn about mapping, location services, and the permissions model before working with notifications and how to persist data. Moving on, you\u0027ll get to grips with testing, covering the full spectrum of the test pyramid. You\u0027ll also learn how AAC (Android Architecture Components) are used to cleanly structure your code and explore various architecture patterns and the benefits of dependency injection. \u003Cem\u003EThe core libraries of RxJava and Coroutines are covered for asynchronous programming\u003C/em\u003E.

But, quite quickly, through a variety of handset offers that struck a chord with practical, price-conscious consumers, as well as those who are fashion-conscious and tech-savvy, Android user numbers exploded. For many, myself included, developing for Android is the most rewarding pastime and business, bar none. Quickly putting together a prototype of an idea, refining it, and then deciding to run with it and wire it up into a fully-fledged app, is such an exciting and rewarding process.

Kotlin is also the most fun language, mainly because the succinctness means you can get results faster and with less code. Google considers Kotlin an official (first-class) Android language. There are some other advantages to Kotlin that make it less error-prone and less likely to make mistakes that cause crashes.

The goal of computer forensics is to perform a structured investigation and maintain a documented chain of evidence to find out exactly what happened on a computing device and who was responsible for it. Computer forensics -- which is sometimes referred to as computer forensic science essentially is data recovery with legal compliance guidelines to make the information admissible in legal proceedings. The terms digital forensics and cyber forensics are often used as synonyms for computer forensics. Digital forensics starts with the collection of information in a way that maintains its integrity. Investigators then analyze the data or system to determine if it was changed, how it was changed and who made the changes. The use of computer forensics isn\u0027t always tied to a crime. The forensic process is also used as part of data recovery processes to gather data from a crashed server, failed drive, reformatted operating system (OS) or other situation where a system has unexpectedly stopped working.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy is computer forensics important?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the civil and criminal justice system, computer forensics helps ensure the integrity of digital evidence presented in court cases.

The term digital forensics was originally used as a synonym for \u003Cstrong\u003Ecomputer forensics\u003C/strong\u003E but has expanded to cover investigation of all devices capable of storing digital data. With roots in the personal computing revolution of the late 1970s and early 1980s, the discipline evolved in a haphazard manner during the 1990s, and it was not until the early 21st century that national policies emerged.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDigital forensics investigations have a variety of applications. The most common is to support or refute a hypothesis before criminal or civil courts. Criminal cases involve the alleged breaking of laws that are defined by legislation and that are enforced by the police and prosecuted by the state, such as theft and assault against the person. Civil cases on the other hand deal with protecting the rights and property of individuals (often associated with family disputes) but may also be concerned with contractual disputes between commercial entities where a form of digital forensics referred to as electronic discovery (discovery) may be involved\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring the 1980s very few specialized digital forensic tools existed, and consequently investigators often performed live analysis on media, examining computers from within the operating system using existing sysadmin tools to extract evidence. This practice carried the risk of modifying data on the disk, either inadvertently or otherwise, which led to claims of evidence tampering. A number of tools were created during the early 1990s to address the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDigital forensics is commonly used in both criminal law and private investigation. Traditionally it has been associated with criminal law, where evidence is collected to support or oppose a hypothesis before the courts. As with other areas of forensics this is often a part of a wider investigation spanning a number of disciplines. In some cases, the collected evidence is used as a form of intelligence gathering, used for other purposes than court proceedings (for example to locate, identify or halt other crimes). As a result, intelligence gathering is sometimes held to a less strict forensic standard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you enroll in our Digital Forensics Masterclass | Forensic Science 2023 DFMC, you\u0027ll not only learn about the fundamentals of digital forensics, but so much more!

The first question I ask anyone thinking about a career in this field is if they enjoy solving puzzles. You may not have access to any information other than the fact that something happened when investigating a case. So, if someone needs to be shown or told what happened, this field may not be right for them. When a case is brought to an investigator\u0027s attention, the investigator is often given instructions to figure out what the computer or device was used for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother important trait is the ability to deal with frustration, as investigative tools and software do not always work without problems. When it comes to cell phones and small devices, this is a fairly common occurrence. Many students, rather than working through the challenges, stop their investigation in class at the first sign of difficulty. They don\u0027t even try to figure out what\u0027s wrong with the tool by looking at the web or using the help system. To be a successful investigator, one must be persistent and creative \u2013 they must be problem solvers. Digital forensics is a branch of forensic science that collects, analyses, documents, and presents digital evidence related to computer crime for use in a court of law using scientific knowledge. Knowing what was done, when it was done, and who did it is the ultimate goal.

Java\u0027s extensive support for this protocol is demonstrated, including \u003Cstrong\u003ENIO\u003C/strong\u003E support, and how UDP can support streaming media. We will also cover in our udemy course Network Scalability, I will explain how, as more demands are placed on a server,\u0026nbsp; systems need to scale to address these demands. Several threading techniques supporting this need are demonstrated, including thread pools, futures, and the \u003Cstrong\u003ENIO\u0027\u003C/strong\u003Es selector. We will also cover in our udemy course Network Security, you\u2019ll learn how applications need to protect against a variety of threats. This is supported in Java using encryption and secure hashing techniques. Symmetric and asymmetric encryption techniques are illustrated. In addition, the use of \u003Cstrong\u003ETLS/SSL\u003C/strong\u003E is demonstrated. We will also cover in our udemy course covers how Java applications may need to exchange information with other applications that are written in different languages. The issues that impact an application\u0027s interoperability are examined, including byte order.

So he is giving us an actual example of the very thing that he is talking about. His expressions and gestures are perfectly suited to the points he is making. And his pronunciation is very clear and easy to understand. Also his sentences are spoken with the emphasis in the right places. This course is designed for native speakers of English. The same basic principles could probably be applied in a course designed for non-native speakers. I would like to see such a course someday. I am really enjoying this course.
