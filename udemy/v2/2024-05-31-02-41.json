It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E* Javascript Course Contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Introduction\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Array\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Variables\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Functions\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Objects\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Control Statements\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Cookies\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Loop statements\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Data Structures\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Error Handling\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Regular Expressions\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESee you inside the course\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThank you see you inside the course\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/css-and-javascript-complete-course-for-beginners/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4282170_1ea0.jpg","duration":"4 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"104,861.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["For People New to CSS And JavaScript","For People Who want to learn CSS And JavaScript Fundamentals and later Transition into Web Designing","For People New to Web Designing"],"tags":["CSS","JavaScript"],"rating":{"count":1349,"averageValue":"4.4"},"instructors":[{"name":"PROPER DOT INSTITUTE","url":"/user/vivek-dahibhate-2/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.360544}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"7FD98C2C3AA3EBDC7E38","originalPrice":"\u20B91,999","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"2 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/projektmanagement/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":802806,"title":"Projektmanagement: Produktivit\u00E4t und Mindset f\u00FCr Erfolg","shortDescription":"Perfektioniere dein Zeitmanagement, lerne den optimalen Umgang mit Kollegen im Projekt!

The course starts right from the basics, where we explore various cloud computing service models. This includes infrastructure as a service, platform as a service, and software as a service. From there students gain hands-on experience with creating and administering remote virtual instances, complete with Ubuntu, Apache, MariaDB, and PHP. Students will learn the difference between popular web servers like Apache and NGINX, along with a detailed overview of various database management systems. This includes both SQL and NoSQL databases, in addition to database transaction standards such as ACID and CAP Theorem. In addition to a theoretical deep dive, the course demonstrates how to install, configure, and secure LAMP stack on Ubuntu for hosting dynamic, database driven web apps. We offer a detailed segment on server security, where students will configure both software and network firewalls for their instance using strict firewall policies, UFW and custom SSH ports. At this stage students will also learn to scale their servers both vertically and horizontally using application load balancers. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe second half of the course provides a comprehensive guide to Amazon Web Services. We start with demonstrating how to setup, secure, and navigate an AWS account. This includes setting up billing alerts and multi-factor authentication. From there, we take a deep dive into AWS Identity and Access management for enhanced account security, and the management of user accounts for various AWS services. Here we explore IAM User management and permissions, IAM Groups, IAM Policies, and access key rotation. Following the IAM section, we\u2019ll jump into the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) service. In this module students lean to deploy virtual instances on AWS using Amazon Machine Images, Elastic IPs, and Launch Templates. We will also explore IAM roles for EC2, EC2 Security Groups, SSH key pair authentication, and remote administration using both terminal and EC2 Instance connect.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAs you can see this course covers a tremendous bit of ground and we hope you\u2019re just as excited about this course as we are, if so - hit that enroll button and let\u2019s get started.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-and-linode-the-ultimate-guide-to-cloud-computing-iaas/","imageUri":"https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4874958_fd10.jpg","duration":"13 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"41,223.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Students interested in Cloud Computing","Students interested in Deploying and Configuring Remote Instances","Students interested in the Foundations of Linux","Students interested in the Foundations of Web Server Software (Apache \u0026 NGINX)","Students interested in Server Security (Network \u0026 Hosted Firewalls, UFW)","Students interested in learning the Foundations of AWS (IAM, EC2)"],"tags":["Amazon AWS","Cloud Computing","LAMP Stack","Cloud Architecture"],"rating":{"count":223,"averageValue":"4.5"},"instructors":[{"name":"YouAccel Training","url":"/user/youaccel/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.546875}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"YOUACCEL59613","originalPrice":"\u20B92,499","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"1 day","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/the-intermediate-python-training-boost-your-python-skills/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":3598748,"title":"Intermediate Python Immersive Training | Boost your career","shortDescription":"Develop your Python programming skills and Master next-level Python features","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to The Intermediate Python Immersive Training | Boost your career\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this course, you will learn in depth the most important Python language topics for the intermediate level.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you have completed this course, you will be able to use all these techniques, which we will list in detail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a wonderful feature in this course, as it explains in important detail all you need in these topics in a direct and practical way that saves you valuable time and effort.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you have completed this course, you will be able to understand and use the following techniques in your Python programs:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIterator from fruitstuple and print each value,\u0026nbsp; Iterator from sequence of characters, for loop to iterate through a tuple, for loop to iterate through a string,\u0026nbsp; Build\u0026nbsp; an iterator that returns numbers, raise StopIteration, local scope of a function, local variable can be accessed from a function inside function function, global variables are available from within any scope, Naming and Renaming Variables, The global keyword makes the variable global, adding a placeholders, displayed as a number with two decimals, Adding Multiple Placeholders, Using index numbers for placeholders, Using named indexes, simple generator function with yield, return a value and terminate the execution of the function, Using generator function with for loop, yield square of number, loop and StopIteration automatically, Use generator expression, pass generator expression in a function, import the regular expressions module, Search the string to see if match or no match, regex function, metacharacters, special sequences and sets,\u0026nbsp; findall list of matches, Search for the first white-space, Making a search that returns no match, Split at each white-space in the string, replace every white space\u0026nbsp; and count parameter, search and return a match object, .span and Searching for upper case, string property to return the string passed into the function, Print the word that contains upper case, display a list of all available modules, create and change directory, getcwd and rmdir, list files and sub directories, sys module, math module, statistics, collections and namedtuple, collections and OrderedDict, collections and deque,\u0026nbsp; random module with functions, creating package called newpackage with files, use from newpackage newfunctions to main, work with init module and use modules, Installing collected newpackage, .... and more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd if you have any inquiries in this course, the instructor will answer them and inform you in detail.
