And then, we are going to build general and cool features inside our own app. It\u0027s going to be mainly on selecting and placing data. After this part, We are going to build a cart system where we will allow users to add food items to the cart so they can order these items online. And then naturally to the checkout page and after this, I am going to show you how to pay with PayPal easily and nicely. After this part is done I am going to show you how the booking part is done with clean elegant code and full validation. Since this part is done we will only have some general parts on the user end like grabbing bookings and orders for every user, allowing users to write reviews, and so on. And then to the admin panel which is going to be really simple yet very functional and you are going to learn a lot building it.

We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables.
