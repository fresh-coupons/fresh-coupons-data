It is based on the idea that a neural network can learn to automatically learn representations of the data at different levels of abstraction. Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) is a type of deep learning model that is a feedforward artificial neural network model that maps sets of input data onto a set of appropriate outputs. MLP is a supervised learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression tasks.

One of the common techniques used in NLP is the term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf). Tf-idf is a statistical measure that reflects the importance of a word in a document or a corpus of documents. The importance increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in the document but is offset by the frequency of the word in the corpus. Tf-idf is used in NLP for tasks such as text classification, text clustering, and information retrieval. It is also used in document summarization and feature extraction for text data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAre there any course requirements or prerequisites?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo introductory skill level of Python programming required\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave a computer (either Mac, Windows, or Linux)\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDesire to learn!\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWho this course is for:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeginners python programmers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeginners Data Science programmers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStudents of Data Science and Machine Learning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone interested in learning more about python, data science, or data visualizations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone interested in the rapidly expanding world of data science!\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDevelopers who want to work in analytics and visualization projects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone who wants to explore and understand data before applying machine learning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThroughout the course, you will have access to a team of experienced instructors who will provide guidance and support as you work on your projects.

This module will help you to understand the complex theory behind the Delta Wye transformer connection as I aim to build your strong concept through phasor diagrams. After this module you will be able to draw Delta Wye connection of transformer. By the end of this part, you will have a strong idea on voltage phasor diagram for delta connected transformer. In this module, different types of phasor diagram are compared with each other.

This section will teach you how Wye connection is made on windings of transformer, what are different ways to configure Wye connection. To give you a better understanding of Wye Wye transformer connection, I discussed the difference of line and phase current in both windings of transformer. Furthermore, you will learn how voltage and current quantities are calculated in addition with the rules for balanced system, and how balanced sets are created by phasors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly, I will explain Circulating Currents and Voltages for Delta Wye connected transformer. Very simple power system is modelled as an example to calculate current and voltages during a faulted condition. For the practical model, you will learn how to calculate both phase and sequence current and voltages, how to relate sequence network diagram with hand-calculated short circuit currents. Furthermore, you will learn how current flows through the Delta Wye transformer connection.

The CRM process typically consists of several key stages:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00B7 Customer Identification: This is the first step in the CRM process. It involves identifying potential customers and capturing relevant information about them. This information may include contact details, demographics, preferences, and purchase history.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00B7 Customer Acquisition: Once potential customers are identified, the next step is to acquire them as actual customers. This can involve various marketing and sales strategies, such as advertising, lead generation, and sales outreach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00B7 Customer Onboarding: After acquiring new customers, it\u0027s essential to ensure a smooth onboarding process.
