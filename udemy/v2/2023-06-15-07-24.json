To run a business at optimal capacity, you need to reduce or eliminate waste from processes and improve production flow. In this course, you\u0027ll learn about Lean strategies to reduce waste by determining which operations add value and which don\u0027t. You\u0027ll explore the concept of continuous flow, and discover how to balance work processes to make production flow more efficient. You\u0027ll define what waste is, where it exists, and what causes it. You\u0027ll also examine aspects of Muda, continuous flow, line balancing, value and non-value-add, and practical Lean techniques for improving Operations Management.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat is waste in Lean Manufacturing?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA core principle in lean methodology is the removal of waste within an operation. And in any business, one of the heaviest drains on profitability is waste. Lean waste can come in the form of time, material, and labor. But it may also be related to the utilization of skill-sets as well as poor planning. In lean manufacturing, waste is any expense or effort that is expended but which does not transform raw materials into an item the customer is willing to pay for. By optimizing process steps and eliminating waste, the only true value is added at each phase of production.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday, the Lean Manufacturing model recognizes 8 types of waste within an operation; seven originally conceived when the Toyota Production System was first conceived, and an eighth added when the lean methodology was adopted within the Western World.

This course is divided into two halves. In the first half we will deal with Deep Learning and Neural Networks and in the second half on top of that, we will continue with Generative Adversarial Networks or GAN or we can call it as \u0027gan\u0027. So lets see what are the topics that are included in each module. At first, the Deep Learning one..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you already know the artificial intelligence domain is divided broadly into deep learning and machine learning. In-fact deep learning is machine learning itself but Deep learning with its deep neural networks and algorithms try to learn high-level features from data without human intervention. That makes deep learning the base of all future self intelligent systems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am starting from the very basic things to learn like learning the programming language basics and other supporting libraries at first and proceed with the core topic. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s see what are the interesting topics included in this course.

We will be using the browser based IDE called Jupyter notebook for our further coding exercises.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know some of you may not be coming from a python based programming background. The next few sessions and examples will help you get the basic python programming skill to proceed with the sessions included in this course. The topics include Python assignment, flow-control, functions List and Tuples, Dictionaries, Functions etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen we will start with learning the basics of the Python Numpy library which is used to adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of classes and functions. Then we will learn the basics of matplotlib library which is a plotting library for Python for corresponding numerical expressions in NumPy. And finally the pandas library which is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter the basics, we will then install the deep learning libraries theano, tensorflow and the API for dealing with these called as Keras. We will be writing all our future codes in keras.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen before we jump into deep learning, we will have an elaborate theory session about the basic Basic Structure of an Artificial Neuron and how they are combined to form an artificial Neural Network. Then we will see what exactly is an activation function, different types of most popular activation functions and the different scenarios we have to use each of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter that we will see about the loss function, the different types of popular loss functions and the different scenarios we have to use each of them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike the Activation and loss functions, we have optimizers which will optimize the neural network based on the training feedback. We will also see the details about most popular optimizers and how to decide in which scenarios we have to use each of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen finally we will discuss about the most popular deep learning neural network types and their basic structure and use cases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurther the course is divided into exactly two halves. The first half is about creating deep learning multi-layer neural network models for text based dataset and the second half about creating convolutional neural networks for image based dataset. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn Text based simple feed forward multi-layer neural network model we will start with a regression model to predict house prices of King County USA. The first step will be to Fetch and Load Dataset from the kaggle website into our program. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen as the second step, we will do an EDA or an Exploratory Data Analysis of the loaded data and we will then prepare the data for giving it into our deep learning model. Then we will define the Keras Deep Learning Model. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce we define the model, we will then compile the model and later we will fit our dataset into the compiled model and wait for the training to complete. After training, the training history and metrics like accuracy, loss etc can be evaluated and visualized using matplotlib. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally we have our already trained model. We will try doing a prediction of the king county real estate price using our deep learning model and evaluate the results.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat was a text based regression model. Now we will proceed with a text based binary classification model. We will be using a derived version of Heart Disease Data Set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Our aim is to predict if a person will be having heart disease or not from the learning achieved from this dataset. The same steps repeat here also. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first step will be to Fetch and Load Dataset into our program. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen as the second step, we will do an EDA or an Exploratory Data Analysis of the loaded data and we will then prepare the data for giving it into our deep learning model. Then we will define the Keras Deep Learning Model. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce we define the model, we will then compile the model and later we will fit our dataset into the compiled model and wait for the training to complete. After training, the training history and metrics like accuracy, loss etc can be evaluated and visualized using matplotlib. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally we have our already trained model. We will try doing a prediction for heart disease using our deep learning model and evaluate the results.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter the text based binary classification model. Now we will proceed with a text based multi class classification model. We will be using the Red Wine Quality Data Set from the kaggle website. Our aim is to predict the multiple categories in which a redwine sample can be placed from the learning achieved from this dataset. The same steps repeat here also. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first step will be to Fetch and Load Dataset into our program. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen as the second step, we will do an EDA or an Exploratory Data Analysis of the loaded data and we will then prepare the data for giving it into our deep learning model. Then we will define the Keras Deep Learning Model. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce we define the model, we will then compile the model and later we will fit our dataset into the compiled model and wait for the training to complete. After training, the training history and metrics like accuracy, loss etc can be evaluated and visualized using matplotlib. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally we have our already trained model. We will try doing a prediction for wine quality with a new set of data and then evaluate the categorical results.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe may be spending much time, resources and efforts to train a deep learning model. We will learn about the techniques to save an already trained model. This process is called serialization. We will at first serialize a model. Then later load it in another program and do the prediction without having to repeat the training.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat was about text based data. We will now proceed with image based data. In the preliminary session we will have an introduction to Digital Image Basics in which we learn about the composition and structure of a digital image.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen we will learn about Basic Image Processing using Keras Functions. There are many classes and functions that help with pre processing an image in the Keras library api. We will learn about the most popular and useful functions one by one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother important and useful image processing function in keras is Image Augmentation in which slightly different versions of images are automatically created during training. We will learn about single image augmentation, augmentation of images within a directory structure and also data frame image augmentation. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen another theory session about the basics of a Convolutional neural network or CNN. We will learn how the basic CNN layers like convolution layer, the pooling layer and the fully connected layer works. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are concepts like Stride Padding and Flattening in convolution for image processing. We will learn them also one by one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow we are all set to start with our CNN Model. We will be designing a model that can classify 5 different types of flowers if provided with an image of a flower in any of these categories. We will be at first downloading the dataset from the kaggle website. Then the first step will be to Fetch and Load this Dataset from our computer into our program. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen as the second step, we have to split this dataset manually for training and then later testing the model. We will arrange them into training and testing folders with each class labelled in separate folders.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen we will define the Keras Deep Learning Model. Once we define the model, we will then compile the model and later we will fit our dataset into the compiled model and wait for the training to complete. After training, the training history and metrics like accuracy, loss etc can be evaluated and visualized using matplotlib. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally we have our already trained model. We will try doing a prediction for five different types of flowers with a new set of image data and then evaluate the categorical results.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are many techniques which we can use to improve the quality of a model. Especially an image based model. The most popular techniques are doing dropout regularization of the model. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next technique is doing the optimization and adjustment of the padding and also the filters in the convolution layers. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd finally optimization using image augmentation. We will tweak different augmentation options in this session.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoing these optimization techniques manually one by one and comparing results is a very tedious task. So we will be using a technique called Hyper parameter tuning in which the keras library itself will switch different optimization techniques that we specify and will report and compare the results without we having to interfere in it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven though these techniques and creation of a model from the scratch is fun. Its very time consuming and may take ages if you are planning to design a large model. In this situation a technique called transfer learning can help us. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe will take the world renounced, state of the art, most popular pre-trained deep learning models designed by experts and we will transfer the learning into our model so that we can make use of the architecture of that model into our custom model that we are building.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe popular state of the art model architectures that we are going to use are the VGG16, VGG19 designed by deep learning experts from the University of Oxford and also ResNet50 created in\u0026nbsp; ImageNet challenge to address the vanishing gradient problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe will at first download these models using keras and will try simple predictions using these pre-trained models. Later we will try the network training for our flower dataset itself using the VGG16. we will make few changes in the model to incorporate our dataset into it. Since the network architecture is not that simple, in our computer it will take a lot of time to complete the training. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo instead of CPU, we have to use a GPU to enhance parallel processing. We will be using a cloud based Free GPU service provied by goggle called Google Colab. At first we will try training with VGG16 in google colab. We will prepare, zip and upload the dataset into google colab. Then we will extract it using linux comands and then do the training. The training is almost ten times faster compared to the local computer. Once we have the trained model we will serialize the model and will do the prediction. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe same procedure will be repeated for VGG19 and also for ResNet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd after having enough knowledge about Deep Learning, we will then move on with our Generative Adversarial Network or GAN\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt first we will have an introduction to GAN. We will discuss about the the basic things inside the GAN, the two different types of networks called the Generator and the Discriminator. And then we will attempt to do a simple Transpose Convolution using a grayscale image. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETranspose convolution is the opposite of the convolution operation that we had in Deep Learning and in the next session, we will once again have a thorough discussion about the Generator and the Discriminator mechanism inside a GAN. After that we will try to implement a Fully Connected, simple GAN using MNIST dataset. We will have a step by step approach in creating this fully connected GAN or fully connected GAN. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt first we will be loading the MNIST dataset. Then we will proceed with defining the Generator function. Once we have the Generator function, we will then define the Discriminator function. And then we will combine this Generator and Discriminator models for our fully connected GAN so that we will have a composite model. And then this model will be compiled so that it can be used for training. After the compilation, we will proceed with training. We will train the discriminator at first and then we will proceed with the generator training. We will also define functions so that during the training of this fully connected gan, we will save the log at regular intervals and also we will plot the graph. Along with the graph,the image generated after each batch of training. And once the training is complete, we will\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esee how it performed. We will see the generated images by this fully connected GAN and also we will save this model\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eso that we can use it for future image generation without having to train it again. We will see how we can do that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce we completed the fully connected GAN, we will then proceed with a more advanced Deep Convoluted GAN or DCGAN. For DCGAN also, we will discuss what is a DCGAN. What\u0027s the difference between DCGAN with a Fully Connected GAN. Then we will try to implement the Deep Convolution GAN or DCGAN At first we will define the Generator function then we will define the Discriminator function. After that we will combine this generator and discriminator models and we will have a composite model. We will then compile this model. Once the compilation is complete, we will proceed with training the model. Since deep convoluted GAN or DCGAN is complex than a fully connected GAN, it will take much time in training it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo we will move the training from our local computer to our Google Colab using GPU. we will train the model and we will use that to generate the MNIST hand written digits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe will use this same deep convolution GAN with other dataset also like the MNIST Fashion dataset. We will train the model using GPU and we will generate images. Then we will have the MNIST hand written digits and also the MNIST Fashion dataset are all simple grayscale images. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe will try with color images also. We will be having the CIFAR-10 dataset. We will define the generator at first. Because its a color dataset, we need to adjust the model. So we will define the generator, then we will define the discriminator once again. Then we will proceed with training using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The training will be done using Google Colab GPU and then we will try to generate images using that trained model.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen we will have a brief discussion about Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks or Conditional GAN. We will compare the normal Vanilla GAN with Conditional GAN. What\u0027s the difference between a normal GAN and a Conditional GAN. And then we will proceed with implementing the Conditional GAN, which is a bit different from our normal GAN. We will at first define the basic generator function and then we will have a Label Embedding for this generator. Then we will define the basic discriminator function and also we will have the label embedding for this discriminator function. Then we will combine this generator and discriminator. We will combine and we will compile. After that, we will proceed with\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etraining the GAN model using our local computer. And we will try to display the generated images. And then we will use the same code, upload it to google colab and do the training with google Colab. And that was for the MNIST hand written digits dataset. We will then proceed with training the Conditional GAN using the MNIST Fashion dataset. The same dataset that we used for our fully connected and also deep convoluted GAN. Once we completed\u0026nbsp; the training, we will try to generate images using the conditional GAN for our Fashion MNIST dataset. And in the next session, we will discuss about the other popular types of GAN and also I will provide you with a git repository which was shared by a deep learning and machine learning expert. I will share that link so that you can try those exercises by yourself and also I will teach you how you can fork that repository into your personal git repository so that you can try the code, change the code\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand see how it performs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that\u0027s all about the topics which are currently included in this quick course.

This course covers an extensive amount of material and by the end you will be proficient enough with AWS to gain an entry level position in cloud administration.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe curriculum starts off with exploring AWS account registration, billing and multi-factor authentication. We then explore more advanced account security through AWS identity and access management (IAM). IAM is an integral part of AWS that facilitates the management of users, groups, and security policies that control AWS resources. Here, we explore the creation of IAM users with varying degrees of account access. This includes user groups, permission policies, and IAM roles for EC2.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOnce students have a firm understanding of IAM, we dive into the backbone of AWS by exploring EC2 instance deployment and configuration. EC2 is a core service of AWS that facilitates the launch of virtual servers (called instances) within the AWS cloud console. We cover how to launch and configure EC2 instances, including choosing the right instance type and setting up security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic. We also explore remote instance administration using PuTTY and Terminal to issue server commands and manage instances from any remote location. Students learn to deploy and assign elastic IP addresses along with the creation of Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) to save instance state and quickly launch new instances with replicated configurations.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAfter completion of the EC2 module, we jump into AWS storage solutions where we explore various storage types including, block, file and object storage. More specifically students learn to harness the power of the Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) and the Amazon Elastic File System (EFS). We demonstrate how to deploy and configure multiple EBS volumes and attach them to existing instances for maximum scalability. Students also learn to design and deploy seamlessly scalable storage systems using EFS. We demonstrate how to mount multiple instances to a single EFS endpoint for centralized access to data files. We complete the module by showcasing the power of EBS snapshots and Amazon Machine Images for efficient instance deployment and backups.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EFrom this point, the course branches into more intermediate concepts by exploring elastic load balancing (ELB), Auto Scaling Groups (ASG), and Route 53. Student will learn to deploy a highly available architecture that auto scales based on real-time traffic workload and instance health checks. Traffic will be routed directly through Amazons Route 53 DNS service, with customized domain names and pre-configured hosted zones.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EBy the end of this course, you will have a solid understanding of how to use AWS to build and deploy your own cloud-based infrastructure.

We\u2019ve only recently started creating devices which benefit from such a language, so in the mid-1990s, they were way ahead of their time. But that goal drove a lot of the architecture of Java. One of its major selling points was \u201Cwrite once, run anywhere,\u201D so in other words you could write one piece of code, then it could be compiled to run on any device.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIronically, Java did not gain popularity for that reason; instead its creators were able to take advantage of something else that came out in the mid-1990s: the world wide web. Java had a feature where you could write things called applets, small programs which could run inside of a web browser, and as the web was gaining popularity, Java rode that wave and became extremely successful and popular. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to learn basic java programming then you are at the right place. In this course you will learn all the basic concept of java.

You can also polish your knowledge from this course. If you don\u0027t know anything about programming you can also take this course to start learning coding. I will teach you from beginner level. First of all, I will teach you how to set editor for writing coding. You see a lot of courses out there talking about basics for Java, and they are good to bring beginner into the world of Java programming.

At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E*\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E javascript course contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript introduction\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript array\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript variables\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript functions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript objects\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript control statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript cookies\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript loop statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript data structures\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript error handling\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript regular expressions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003Esection 4- learn PHP\u0026nbsp;programming language\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis section will learn the basic structure of a web application and how a web browser interacts with a web server.

I will guide you step by step starting from the basics and always assuming you don\u0027t have previous programming experience or a computer science degree. In fact, most people who learn Python come from a vast variety of careers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea behind developing Python 3 was to implement a single big change that got rid of a legacy problem in Python: rendering all strings as Unicode behind the scenes. As Brett Cannon, one of the core developers of Python, writes, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPeople sometimes forget how old Python is; Guido started coding Python in December 1989 and was first released as open source in February 1991. This means that Python itself predates the first volume of the Unicode standard which came out in October 1991. Over the intervening years, languages created after Unicode standardized chose to base their implementation for strings on encodings that could support Unicode. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis course is designed to not only teach you Python, but to also give you a real feel of how to use Python in a real enviornment.
