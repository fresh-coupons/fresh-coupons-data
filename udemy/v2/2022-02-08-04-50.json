Pytest is one of the most actively maintained testing frameworks in the industry, and provides an incredible set of tools for faster, less-stressful testing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAutomated testing is one of the most in-demand fields in today\u0027s tech market, but there is very little guidance on how the engineer can move from writing tests to building a robust test architecture. Reliable test frameworks save compounding amounts of time and money, improve trust between testers and developers, and make for happier testers. Happy testers are more productive, more effective, and tend to grow within the organization. Everyone wins.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe most widely circulated videos on these topics speak only to the technologies themselves, and do not offer viable implementation guidance or valuable industry practices.
