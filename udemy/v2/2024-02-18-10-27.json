For example, many small businesses use accounting software like QuickBooks to record financial transactions and construct financial statements for their business. However, far fewer use financial accounting software to fulfill the same functions for their individual finances, a task that may be accomplished with Money in Excel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnlike financial accounting software, Money in Excel will also bring in balance sheet data directly from our financial institutions and put it in one location, balance sheet data like checking accounting balances, savings accounting balances, brokerage account balances, credit card balances, loan balances, and mortgage balances.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAccounting software like QuickBooks does not generally pull balance sheet balances directly from financial institutions because accounting software is designed to construct the ending balances using the double entry accounting system. Once the balance sheet balances have been constructed traditional accounting software will compare our book balance to the institution balance using tools such as bank reconciliations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis course will cover how to access the Money in Excel template and connect it to financial institutions, downloading financial data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe will work through a practice problem, imagining we are a small business wanting to construct an income statement needed for our income tax preparation at year end, income tax reported on a Schedule C Profit or Loss From Business Form. As we work the practice problem, we will compare the process to what may be done using traditional accounting software like QuickBooks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe will then investigate construction of a personal balance sheet using Money in Excel, comparing how the process may be done using traditional accounting software.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe course will also cover other functions provided by Money in Excel including budgeting options and recurring transactions.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/money-in-excel-income-tax-sch-c-personal-financials/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/3889976_e0d4.jpg","duration":"3 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"64,063.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Business owners who report business income using a Sch.

Naturally, we are going to get started by setting up the right tools for our projects. And after that, we are going to build our first simple yet very interesting project and that\u0027s a payment page with Paypal. The second project will be about a simple forum system. They are going to be also a couple of generic projects like the full CRUD\u0026nbsp;app and so on. After this, the next project will be the starting of something big because it\u0027s an authentication system where I am going to teach you how to develop a login and a register page, how to hash and de-hash passwords, how to do validation and so much more. After this, we are going to build a comments system and this will be the biggest project in this course. We will begin first by doing a post system and then we will grab comments for every post that we have of course we will use Ajax-JQuery for inserting, deleting, and showing comments. after that, we will integrate a rating system into the previous two projects to make a bigger project. So, I will show how to download a JQuery plugin, how to integrate it and how to use it to do the rating system for every post, and so on. And the rating system is going to be implemented of course using Ajax-JQuery. The upcoming project is going to be also created with Ajax and JQuery and that\u0027s a live search system and we will combine it with our big project. There are a lot of projects along the way but it\u0027s going to take a very long time to talk about them. So I will let you discover the many benefits of this course.
