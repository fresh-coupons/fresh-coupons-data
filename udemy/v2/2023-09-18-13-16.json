The LiveView programming model is mostly declarative: instead of saying \u0022when event ABC happens, change XYZ on the page\u0022, events in LiveView are managed by handlers bound to event id. Once the state changes, LiveView will re-render the relevant parts of its HTML template(calculate diff) and push it to the browser, which updates itself most efficiently. This means developers write LiveView templates as any other server-rendered HTML and LiveView does the hard work of tracking changes and sending the relevant diffs to the browser using websocket communication.

It is implemented through a system called jails, as well as a userland utility plus, depending on the system, a number of other utilities. The functionality was committed into FreeBSD in 1999 by Poul-Henning Kamp after some period of production use by a hosting provider and was first released with FreeBSD 4.0, thus being supported on a number of FreeBSD descendants, including DragonFly BSD, to this day.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe need for the FreeBSD jails came from a small shared-environment hosting provider\u0027s (R\u0026amp;D Associates, Inc.\u0027s owner, Derrick T. Woolworth) desire to establish a clean, clear-cut separation between their own services and those of their customers, mainly for security and ease of administration (jail(8)). Instead of adding a new layer of fine-grained configuration options, the solution adopted by Poul-Henning Kamp was to compartmentalize the system \u2013 both its files and its resources \u2013 in such a way that only the right people are given access to the right compartments.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETopics covered in this course:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u0027Mastering Jails\u0027 course covers most of the Jails setup options available and required for running Jails in real live scenarios.

Naturally, we are going to get started by setting up the right tools for our projects. And after that, we are going to build our first simple yet very interesting project and that\u0027s a URL shortening service. The second project will be about sending emails in PHP and that\u0027s very important because it\u0027s a feature that almost every website has. The next project will be the starting of something big because it\u0027s an authentication system where I am going to teach you how to develop a login and a register page, how to hash and de-hash passwords, how to do validation and so much more. After this, we are going to build a comments system and this will be the biggest project in this course. We will begin first by doing a post system and then we will grab comments for every post that we have of course we will use Ajax-JQuery for inserting, deleting, and showing comments. after that, we will integrate a rating system into the previous two projects to make a bigger project. So, I will show how to download a JQuery plugin, how to integrate it and how to use it to do the rating system for every post, and so on. And the rating system is going to be implemented of course using Ajax-JQuery. The upcoming project is going to be also created with Ajax and JQuery and that\u0027s a live search system and we will combine it with our big project. The last project will be about building a weather app. All we are going to do is set up a form, allow the user to enter a city, and then give him the current degree of this city. So we will use an API to grab the current degree for this city.

He\u0027s spot on regarding messaging (refining the three points you need to make) and how to prepare on short notice. Between the training videos and the PDF books included in the course, it\u0027s invaluable -- and affordable for just about anyone. I took a media training course in NYC which required me to fly in for three entire weekends over the course of three consecutive months; TJ Walker covered essentially the same content right here. I\u0027ve worked in radio/television as a producer/host and I\u0027ve been interviewed by national media outlets from Good Morning America to the New York Times, so I\u0027m picky; and I\u0027m typically critical of those I see out there passing themselves off as media training experts, especially since I do media training (on a much smaller scale) myself. TJ Walker is the real deal. Though the production values aren\u0027t high end and the lighting/background could use some tweaking, the content itself is top-notch. Whether you have only two hours or up to two days before your interview, you\u0027ll have a significantly better chance of success by investing part of that time in taking this\u0022 \u003C/em\u003ELinda Lowen\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u0027\u0027I faced a lot of tvs, Radio, and Phone interviews in recent months.
