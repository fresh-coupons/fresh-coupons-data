It is responsible for coordinating the execution of the entire Spark application. The driver program defines the SparkContext, which serves as the entry point for Spark functionality. It handles the division of the application into tasks, scheduling them on the cluster, and managing the overall execution. The driver communicates with the cluster manager to allocate resources and coordinate the distribution of tasks to worker nodes. It also maintains control and monitoring of the application.

To run a business at optimal capacity, you need to reduce or eliminate waste from processes and improve production flow. In this course, you\u0027ll learn about Lean strategies to reduce waste by determining which operations add value and which don\u0027t. You\u0027ll explore the concept of continuous flow, and discover how to balance work processes to make production flow more efficient.

And in any business, one of the heaviest drains on profitability is waste. Lean waste can come in the form of time, material, and labor. But it may also be related to the utilization of skill-sets as well as poor planning. In lean manufacturing, waste is any expense or effort that is expended but which does not transform raw materials into an item the customer is willing to pay for. By optimizing process steps and eliminating waste, the only true value is added at each phase of production.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday, the Lean Manufacturing model recognizes 8 types of waste within an operation; seven originally conceived when the Toyota Production System was first conceived, and an eighth added when the lean methodology was adopted within the Western World.
