Effective customer engagement is crucial for fostering loyalty, encouraging repeat business, and creating brand advocates. Effective customer engagement is an ongoing process that requires a deep understanding of customer needs and preferences. Brands that prioritize engagement build lasting relationships with their customers, leading to increased satisfaction and loyalty. Customer engagement strategies are essential for actively involving customers with a brand, creating positive interactions, and fostering long-term relationships.

By leveraging analytics, businesses can gain insights into customer behavior, preferences, and satisfaction levels. Customer engagement analytics acts as a guide for businesses, helping them understand, predict, and respond to customer behavior effectively. It empowers businesses to create personalized, targeted, and timely engagements that build strong, long-lasting relationships with their customers.

They will also explore AWS security best practices, including multi-factor authentication, encryption, and audit logging.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ENext, the course covers Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), a core AWS service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. Students learn how to launch, configure, and manage EC2 instances, including choosing the right instance type, creating custom Amazon Machine Images (AMIs), and working with Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe course then moves on to AWS Storage (EC2), which covers the various storage options available in AWS. Students will learn about Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3), Elastic File System (EFS), and Amazon Glacier, and how to use them to store and retrieve data in the cloud.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EFrom there, we dive into ELB, ASG, and Route 53, which are essential AWS services for building scalable and fault-tolerant applications. Students learn how to use Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) to distribute incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances, Auto Scaling Groups (ASG) to automatically adjust capacity based on demand, and Route 53 to manage DNS and domain names.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EFinally, the course introduces HTML and CSS Foundations, the building blocks of modern web development. Students will learn how to create basic HTML pages and use CSS to style and layout content. They will also explore responsive design principles and learn how to create web pages that adapt to different screen sizes and devices.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThroughout the course, students will work on hands-on labs and projects that reinforce the concepts we explore. By the end of the course, students will have a solid understanding of AWS fundamentals, web development basics, and how to use AWS services to build scalable and secure web applications. They will also be well-prepared to pursue further study in AWS and web development.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/build-and-deploy-responsive-websites-on-aws-using-html-css/","imageUri":"https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5037480_c76c.jpg","duration":"13.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"20,068.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Developers and software engineers who want to gain a solid understanding of AWS services and how to build scalable and secure web applications.","IT professionals who are responsible for managing and provisioning AWS resources and need to develop proficiency in IAM, EC2, and other core AWS services.","Business owners and entrepreneurs who are looking to leverage cloud computing for their web-based applications and need to understand the benefits and costs associated with AWS.","Students and recent graduates who are pursuing careers in web development, cloud computing, or related fields and need to gain foundational knowledge in AWS and web development.","Anyone interested in learning about cloud computing and web development and wants to develop new skills and knowledge in these areas."],"tags":["Cloud Computing","CSS","HTML","Web Development"],"rating":{"count":72,"averageValue":"4.6"},"instructors":[{"name":"YouAccel Training","url":"/user/youaccel/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.5555553}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"YOUACCEL63082","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"2 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/foreclosure-real-estate-investing/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":2422262,"title":"Foreclosure Success for Real Estate Investors by Jay Conner","shortDescription":"How to Create Win-Win in Foreclosures","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EForeclosure\u003C/strong\u003E is a legal process in which a lender attempts to recover the balance of a loan from a borrower who has stopped making payments to the lender by forcing the sale of the asset used as the collateral for the loan.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt creates a unique opportunity for real estate investors to acquire properties for a steep discount, while helping the owners get out of a tough situation. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this fast paced course based on Jay\u0027s live presentations to a small group of dedicated real estate investors, you will discover:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat foreclosures are\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow to find pre-foreclosures before your competition\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow the foreclosures process works\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy it is a Win/Win/Win/Win situation\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat to do with your foreclosure property after you close on it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand much more...\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPresident Joe Biden extended a federal moratorium on evictions and foreclosures in January, 2021.

By addressing stigma, we can create an environment where individuals feel comfortable seeking help, receiving appropriate care, and living fulfilling lives. Mental health stigma refers to the negative attitudes, beliefs, and stereotypes that surround mental health and mental illness. It involves prejudiced judgments, discrimination, and the marginalization of individuals with mental health conditions. Stigma can manifest at various levels, including societal, interpersonal, and self-stigma. Addressing mental health stigma involves promoting awareness, education, and challenging misconceptions. Efforts to reduce stigma aim to create a more supportive and understanding environment for individuals with mental health conditions, fostering a society where mental health is treated with the same importance and empathy as physical health. The objective of this course is to understand and explore the concept and types of mental health stigma, examine how mental health stigma affects individuals and society and develop strategies to combat mental health stigma. This course aims to help educators, students, research scholars, mental health practitioners and counselors to understand and apply strategies for combating mental health stigma and promoting mental health resilience.
