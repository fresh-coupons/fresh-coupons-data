This is a project based course where you will learn step by step on how to build a news channel and to create news videos with fully animated and super realistic AI powered news anchors. This course will give you a whole new perspective about how artificial intelligence is more than capable of revolutionising journalism. In addition, you will also be amazed by how far AI can automate news videos creation by speeding up the editing process as well as replacing human news anchors with a hyper realistic artificial intelligence powered news anchor as the substitution which can be very useful for independent journalist who want to keep their identity secret due to privacy or safety reasons. In the introduction session, you will learn several aspects where AI can be utilised to create news videos, such as converting news scripts to audio and producing animated news anchors to present the news. Then, you will continue by getting to know several news sources like Google News, AP News, and Reuters as well as learning how to check the potential bias and reliability of the news. This part is very crucial to make sure the news you are planning to cover are actually factual. Afterward, you will get to know several news topic ideas that you should consider and it is really recommended for you just to pick one and concentrate on that one topic. Once you have chosen your news topic, we will enter the main part of the course where you will be guided step by step on how to create and edit news video from scratch using AI tools like HeyGen, HourOne, and Paradiso AI. Those tools will enable you to convert text to audio as well as to integrate the audio with the fully animated news anchors. Once the video has been created and ready to be uploaded, we will go over comprehensive analysis on which social media platform that you should be uploading to. In that section, we will be mainly focusing on Youtube and Tiktok since those two platforms have the most audience and also the best options for video based contents. Last but not least, at the end of the course, you will learn several different ways to monetise your news channel and how to potentially turn this side hustle into a sustainable media business.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, before getting into the course, we need to ask this question to ourselves: why should we build a news channel? Well, if you were asking this question five or ten years ago, at that time, there had not been a lot of independent journalist yet and most of journalists work for media companies, nonetheless, the situation is totally different nowadays, as the rise of independent journalism in the past few years, more and more news channels are created on social media platforms like Youtube and Tiktok.

We will explore how to implement these structures in C\u002B\u002B and how to perform basic operations like insertion, deletion, and searching. Additionally, we will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each data structure and when to use them in different situations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELinked lists, for example, are a popular data structure used to store and manage data in a sequence. Linked lists are efficient because they can be dynamically allocated and are flexible in size. However, they can be more complicated to implement and use than other data structures like arrays.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStacks and queues are also important data structures that are commonly used in software development. Stacks use the \u0022last in, first out\u0022 (LIFO) principle, while queues use the \u0022first in, first out\u0022 (FIFO) principle. These data structures are useful for managing data in a specific order, and we will learn how to implement and use them in our class.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrees are another popular data structure that we will cover in our class. Trees are useful for organizing data in a hierarchical structure and are often used in computer science applications like file systems, databases, and search engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to data structures, we will also cover the basics of OOP in C\u002B\u002B. Object-oriented programming focuses on encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. With OOP, we can create reusable code, improve code organization and structure, and make code maintenance more manageable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn our class, we will cover the basics of OOP in C\u002B\u002B, including classes, objects, constructors, and destructors.

This is basically an extensive project based course where you will be guided step by step on how to build a cryptocurrency price tracking website using Wordpress alongside with Cryptocurrency Widgets plugin which is a Wordpress plugin that was specifically designed to create cryptocurrency market price tracker just like Coinmarketcap and Coingecko. In addition, Cryptocurrency Widgets plugin is also supported by CoinGecko API, therefore, the price data that will be displayed on the Wordpress website will be reliable and most up to date data. In the introduction session, you will learn the basic fundamentals of Wordpress and get to know more about Cryptocurrency Widgets which is the plugin that will be utilised in this project. Then, you will also get to know the general overview of the project that we are going to build as well as all features that will be included. Before getting to the main section of the course, you will be guided step by step on how to set up all necessary tools like creating an account on Taste WP which is Wordpress testing platform that we are going to use and also installing the plugin that we need for this project. Once we are ready, you will learn step by step on how to build the crypto price tracker website from scratch, we will go over how to import the price columns and how to change the currency. After the website has been built, we are going to be conducting testing to make sure that the crypto price tracking website has been fully functioning and also easy to use from the user\u2019s perspective. There will be four main testing objectives that will be emphasised in this course, those are functionality testing, user experience testing, compatibility testing, and performance testing. Once the website has been tested and passed all the required criteria, you are going to get to know more about affordable domain and hosting options. Hopefully, this particular section will enable you to make informed decisions about which hosting service you want to use. At the end of the course, you will also learn how to monetise your cryptocurrency price tracking website, we will go over several strategies such as displaying ads, premium ICO, and subscription based model.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, before getting into the course, we need to ask ourselves this question: why should we learn or even build a cryptocurrency price tracking website? Well, there are many answers to that question but in my opinion, cryptocurrency, web 3.0, and blockchain have been growing very rapidly in the past few years, hence, the demand for crypto tracking websites will always be there. If you were thinking about creating the exact clone of Coinmarketcap or Coingecko, then most likely, it will not work since they have already dominated the market a long time even before you started however if you have new creative ideas and try to combine those innovations with crypto price tracker system in your website, I am pretty sure you have a good chance to succeed.
