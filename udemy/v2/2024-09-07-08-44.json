It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E*\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E javascript course contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript introduction\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript array\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript variables\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript functions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript objects\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript control statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript cookies\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript loop statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript data structures\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript error handling\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript regular expressions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003Esection 3- learn PHP\u0026nbsp;programming language\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this section, we will learn the basic structure of a web application, and how a web browser interacts with a web server.

Thinking classrooms create a more engaging and effective learning environment by fostering critical thinking, problem-solving, and collaborative skills. Implementing this approach requires thoughtful planning and a willingness to shift from traditional teaching methods to more dynamic, student-centered practices.

In order to achieve this goal, it is necessary to design lessons in which students take an active role, rather than merely receiving it.

This approach promotes analytical thinking, innovative problem-solving, and teamwork among pupils. PBL helps students gain a more thorough grasp of the material and improves their problem-solving ability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Learning Through Collaboration\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThinking classrooms rely on collaboration. Student group work aims to solve problems collaboratively, share ideas, and exchange viewpoints. This collaborative approach exposes students to many perspectives and problem-solving methods and helps them develop their social and communication skills.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition, the module talks about 1. Student Engagement\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the fundamental principles of a thinking classroom is active student engagement. This involves creating an environment where students are not just passive recipients of information but active participants in the learning process.

Problem-Based Learning\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThinking classrooms prioritize problem-based learning (PBL), where students tackle complex, real-world problems that don\u2019t have straightforward solutions.

PBL fosters a deeper understanding of the subject matter and enhances problem-solving skills.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Collaborative Learning\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECollaboration is a critical component of thinking classrooms.

Random Grouping\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThinking classrooms often use random grouping to ensure that all students interact with different peers and perspectives. Changing groups regularly prevents cliques and promotes inclusivity. This strategy encourages students to develop interpersonal skills and learn from diverse viewpoints.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Vertical Non-Permanent Surfaces (VNPS)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing VNPS, such as whiteboards or chalkboards on walls, allows students to stand and work on problems collaboratively.
