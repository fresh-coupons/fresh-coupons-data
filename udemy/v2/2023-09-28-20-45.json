Soerin guided me through the different research phases, from the literature review until the conclusion and recommendations. By asking probing questions instead of immediately giving the answers to my questions, Soerin not only contributed to a thesis that I\u2019m proud of, but also made me a better researcher. The recommendations that Soerin gave during his review of my thesis drafts were helpful and often formed the basis of new insights. When I hit a block while working on a factor analysis, Soerin helped me via a Skype session during which he looked at my SPSS and SmartPLS output live. Because of his enthusiasm, positive attitude and \u201Ccan do\u201D mentality, my interactions with Soerin were always pleasant and motivating.\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ESoerin, many thanks for your support!\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKevin \u003Cbr\u003EMaster of Science in Accountancy\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u0022I would definitely recommend Soerin as thesis advisor. Not only does Soerin help with the students plan for research, he also helps to\u0026nbsp;improve the plan by making recommendations for advanced research (and additional analyses). Soerin is a very\u0026nbsp;fine coach and works very structured, which triggers the students to be passioned. Soerin is easily accessible and responsive to questions and / or ambiguities. Soerin is\u0026nbsp;certainly willing to help the students when problems occur. Soerin has a lot of knowledge, not only in the content but also in the structure and design of the study. He may also communicate this knowledge in a proper way, so that things are understandable for others. Soerin reviewed the thesis very detailed, by making comments in Word. The review notes will be clear and transparent. Soerin is very keen on the support of your written pieces with appropriate citations. He also helps to make your writing style \u0027journal proof\u0027. He gives examples (references to pieces from other papers) and make suggestions to improve your writing style. Soerin motivates others to \u201Cget the best out of yourself\u201D. Upon reviewing my thesis also noticed me that Soerin always reviewed with the why question. With this, he triggers another to think even more about the background of the texts are written. I\u2019am very positive about the contact times I had with Soerin, he shares his information with great passion, he is patient and takes his time to help you with questions or ambiguities. I don\u2019t have any improvement points for Soerin as thesis advisor. Again, I would recommend Soerin to anyone!\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJosina \u003Cbr\u003EMaster of Science in Accountancy\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#3\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022\u003Cem\u003EMy masterthesis (in Health Law) was recently reviewed by Soerin. While this thesis was outside his field, he provided me valuable feedback on the most crucial parts of my thesis, which were the main relevance between the\u0026nbsp;research question and subquestions, applied thesis methodology and theoretical structure in order to achieve consistency between title, problem, purpose and research questions. I\u2019ve also asked him to review my Final Conclusion \u0026amp; Recommendations. While his profession is in accountancy, his tips and key notes were very helpful and motivated me to finetune my thesis in some certain aspects such as re-production of my research findings and used theoretical literature. I think it is a real added value to let your thesis review by a professional teacher, who reviews dozens of master thesis a week. At the end I would really recommend anyone to let it reviewed by Soerin, which will motivate you to take the extra mile to finish your thesis on time\u003C/em\u003E\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJessica\u003Cbr\u003EMaster in Law\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#4\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022\u003Cem\u003EI hereby would like to recommend Soerin\u0026nbsp;as thesis supervisor / mentor in writing.\n\n Not for your ego but as a huge benefit for future students.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThe reason why I would recommend him is because I believe he sees\u0026nbsp;himself failing when a student fails.

Multiple programs to analyse but also multiple ways to analyse. To connect the dots for a student in times they need it the most is a comfortable action. For example: In my experience I was stuck in an analysis and he\u0026nbsp;did not tell me the answer, but showed me a door which made me think of how to deal with a hurdle.\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EImprovement can be accomplished on the areas of stopping a student when a student is only focussed on deadlines and less on quality of previous handed in parts of the thesis.

Below are some reasons why you should learn Deep learning in R\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\t1. It\u2019s a popular language for Machine Learning at top tech firms. Almost all of them hire data scientists who use R. Facebook, for example, uses R to do behavioral analysis with user post data. Google uses R to assess ad effectiveness and make economic forecasts. And by the way, it\u2019s not just tech firms: R is in use at analysis and consulting firms, banks and other financial institutions, academic institutions and research labs, and pretty much everywhere else data needs analyzing and visualizing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\t2. Learning the data science basics is arguably easier in R. R has a big advantage: it was designed specifically with data manipulation and analysis in mind. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\t3. Amazing packages that make your life easier. Because R was designed with statistical analysis in mind, it has a fantastic ecosystem of packages and other resources that are great for data science. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\t4. Robust, growing community of data scientists and statisticians. As the field of data science has exploded, R has exploded with it, becoming one of the fastest-growing languages in the world (as measured by StackOverflow). That means it\u2019s easy to find answers to questions and community guidance as you work your way through projects in R.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\t5. Put another tool in your toolkit. No one language is going to be the right tool for every job. Adding R to your repertoire will make some projects easier \u2013 and of course, it\u2019ll also make you a more flexible and marketable employee when you\u2019re looking for jobs in data science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat is the difference between Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPut simply, machine learning and data mining use the same algorithms and techniques as data mining, except the kinds of predictions vary. While data mining discovers previously unknown patterns and knowledge, machine learning reproduces known patterns and knowledge\u2014and further automatically applies that information to data, decision-making, and actions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDeep learning, on the other hand, uses advanced computing power and special types of neural networks and applies them to large amounts of data to learn, understand, and identify complicated patterns.

That comes from asking a lot of really smart questions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour stories cannot be one size fits all. They have to be tailored to fit the needs of your customer. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey should not take forever to tell. Audiences have the attention span of a three year old. Get to the point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKnow the purpose of the story. Tell them something they don\u2019t know. If it\u2019s the same old, same old, they will tune you out and good luck getting them back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo your\u003Cstrong\u003E stories have to be\u003C/strong\u003E long? No. Drawn out tales might confuse or bore your audience. Before telling the story ask your self: what\u2019s the point? What is vitally important for my audience to know? And you must answer their unasked but extremely important question, why should I care?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBrevity is beautiful. Be your own best editor. Eliminate verbal excess. Steve Job\u2019s famous speech at Stanford University was fifteen minutes. Martin Luther King\u2019s I have a dream speech was powerful but brief, only seventeen minutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo more than three points to every story. Why three? First of all, its memorable. We can hold three concepts in our brain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake your messages timely, interesting, relevant, understandable. Always translate and interpret what you are saying. Never take it for granted that others are getting what you are saying. Say things like \u201CHere\u2019s what I mean by that, here\u2019s why I think this is important, here\u2019s how I came to this conclusion, here\u2019s how this changes things\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe vastly overestimate our ability to communicate our ideas and feelings. We are convinced that we are being incredibly clear. The listener may not be so sure. This course will coach you how to formulate ideas so they are understandable, and action oriented.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETell your stories with passion and conviction. If you\u0027re not enthusiastic, how can you expect your customer to feel that way? Using a flat, dull voice is a turnoff for your client. They may look interested, but their mind is elsewhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKnow your customer. One size does not fit all. Customize your approach so it makes sense to the person you are talking to. Your stories should be about how your products will in some meaningful ways make their lives better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother benefit of story telling is sales is that they can demonstrate how you solve customer\u0027s problems. They have challenges, you have solutions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShow them that you are on their side by being a good listener. Really tune into what\u0027s really bothering them. What are they not saying? Listen between the lines. Watch their facial expressions and body language. Above all, ask a lot of smart questions and even more follow ups. Their answers will help you to formulate a sales prevention that will connect with them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour sales stories should not always about solving a problem. It could also be about delighting customers. Yes, clothing is a necessity, but we buy with our emotions. Our choices involve style, creativity, color, and image. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EStories can also demonstrate \u003C/strong\u003Ehow you are better than your competitors.
