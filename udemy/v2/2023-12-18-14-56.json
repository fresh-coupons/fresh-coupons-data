It supports various browsers like Chrome, Firefox, IE, and Safari, enabling testers to run test scripts across different browsers seamlessly. This feature is crucial for ensuring that web applications function consistently across all platforms. Unlike option B, Selenium does not require extensive coding knowledge, as it provides a user-friendly interface for writing and executing test scripts. While Selenium is predominantly used for web-based applications, stating that it\u0027s limited to them (option C) is inaccurate as it can be integrated with other tools for broader testing scopes. Option D is incorrect as Selenium supports multiple programming languages, including Java, C#, Python, and Ruby.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E2.

This allows for easy modification of test data without altering the test scripts, making the tests more flexible and reusable. Option A is incorrect as hard-coding data is contrary to the principles of the data-driven framework. Option C, while innovative, does not accurately represent the concept of the data-driven framework. Option D misleads by suggesting a focus on data security, which, while important, is not the primary focus of this framework.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E3.

It measures the performance and load capacity of web applications by simulating a variety of scenarios and analyzing the response of the application under different load types. Selenium (Option A) is primarily used for functional and regression testing, not performance testing. Cucumber (Option C) is a BDD tool and is not specialized for performance testing. Appium (Option D) is focused on mobile application testing and does not primarily cater to performance testing of web applications.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E4.

This integration allows for immediate and ongoing feedback on the current state of the software, enabling quick identification and fixing of defects. This approach aligns with Agile\u0027s emphasis on continuous improvement and adaptability. Option A is incorrect as Agile methodology does not confine automation testing to the final stage. Option C is a common misconception; while automation enhances testing efficiency, it does not eliminate the need for manual testing. Option D is incorrect as Agile methodology very much accommodates and benefits from automation testing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E5.

It allows for the creation, execution, and validation of SOAP and RESTful web services, providing robust support for testing the functionality, reliability, performance, and security of these services. Option A is incorrect as SoapUI is not intended for GUI testing. Option B, while highlighting performance testing, inaccurately associates it with desktop applications, not SoapUI\u0027s specialty. Option D is misleading because, although SoapUI can interact with databases, its primary purpose is not to conduct database testing using SQL queries. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnroll in \u0022Mastering Automation Testing\u0022 today and take a significant step towards achieving your career goals in the dynamic field of Automation Testing.
