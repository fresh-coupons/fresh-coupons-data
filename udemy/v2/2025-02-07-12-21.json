Did you build a couple of projects with PHP and MySQL, but you still think you are inexperienced and you are missing out on a lot of things when coming to developing bigger projects? If yes, then this course is the right resource for you. This course is very digestible and informative and it was created specifically to enhance your coding skills and knowledge not just in PHP and MySQL, but overall in developing web projects. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is what we are going to do in this course. Naturally, we are going to get started by setting up the right tools for our projects. And after that, we are going to build our first simple yet very interesting project and that\u0027s a URL shortening service. The second project will be about sending emails in PHP and that\u0027s very important because it\u0027s a feature that almost every website has. The next project will be the starting of something big because it\u0027s an authentication system where I am going to teach you how to develop a login and a register page, how to hash and de-hash passwords, how to do validation and so much more. After this, we are going to build a comments system and this will be the biggest project in this course. We will begin first by doing a post system and then we will grab comments for every post that we have of course we will use Ajax-JQuery for inserting, deleting, and showing comments. after that, we will integrate a rating system into the previous two projects to make a bigger project. So, I will show how to download a JQuery plugin, how to integrate it and how to use it to do the rating system for every post, and so on. And the rating system is going to be implemented of course using Ajax-JQuery. The upcoming project is going to be also created with Ajax and JQuery and that\u0027s a live search system and we will combine it with our big project. The last project will be about building a weather app. All we are going to do is set up a form, allow the user to enter a city, and then give him the current degree of this city. So we will use an API to grab the current degree for this city. If that sounds like something that you are interested in, go ahead and get the course now. see you inside!! \u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/php-with-mysql-2023-build-7-php-and-mysql-projects/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5010434_6d6a_3.jpg","duration":"6 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"34,452.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Every PHP and MySQL developer who want to advance their skills","Developers who want to explore web development further","Developers who want to build cool projects and to build up their CVs"],"tags":["Bootstrap","MySQL","PHP","PDO"],"rating":{"count":155,"averageValue":"4.3"},"instructors":[{"name":"Web Coding","url":"/user/bdb27e95-65f5-415a-956b-65f62ba4bfc3/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.22}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"PHP7PROJECTS58","originalPrice":"\u20B91,799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/xero-not-for-profit-organization/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":2892636,"title":"Xero Not for Profit Organization","shortDescription":"Learn Not for Profit accounting using Xero from a practicing CPA","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003ELearners will understand how to set up Xero for a Not for Profit Organization.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe course will show how to use free resources to optimize learning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe will demonstrate the use of category tracking to generate Not for Profit reports.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearners will see how to create and use donation receipt forms.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe will show how to create and use pledge receipt forms.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe course will demonstrate how to enter and track restricted resources.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe will enter month end adjusting entries.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearners will see how to allocate expenses to programs and administrative categories.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe will record net assets released from restriction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe course will show how to generate, analyze, memorize, \u0026amp; export to Excel financial reports.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/xero-not-for-profit-organization/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2892636_fec5.jpg","duration":"9 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"29,484.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Anybody how wants to learn Not for Profit accounting in a practical way"],"tags":["Xero"],"rating":{"count":37,"averageValue":"4.6"},"instructors":[{"name":"Robert (Bob) Steele","url":"/user/c91d6786-95f3-48d8-ab94-cc92431d2aa4/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.581081}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"4CB26D2940EE0399027A","originalPrice":"\u20B92,699","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/master-the-blender-for-game-art-film-design/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5875710,"title":"Master the Blender for Game Art, Film \u0026 Design","shortDescription":"Master Blender for Game Art, Film \u0026 Design: The Complete 3D Artist Course","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EMaster the Blender for Game Art, Film \u0026amp; Design: Unleash Your Creative Potential in 3D\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EElevate your skills and bring your artistic vision to life with Blender, the industry-leading 3D creation software!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis comprehensive course is designed for aspiring and intermediate artists who want to master Blender for creating stunning 3D assets in the realms of game art, film, and design.
