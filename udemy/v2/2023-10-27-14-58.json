The LiveView programming model is mostly declarative: instead of saying \u0022when event ABC happens, change XYZ on the page\u0022, events in LiveView are managed by handlers bound to event id. Once the state changes, LiveView will re-render the relevant parts of its HTML template(calculate diff) and push it to the browser, which updates itself most efficiently. This means developers write LiveView templates as any other server-rendered HTML and LiveView does the hard work of tracking changes and sending the relevant diffs to the browser using websocket communication.

It is implemented through a system called jails, as well as a userland utility plus, depending on the system, a number of other utilities. The functionality was committed into FreeBSD in 1999 by Poul-Henning Kamp after some period of production use by a hosting provider and was first released with FreeBSD 4.0, thus being supported on a number of FreeBSD descendants, including DragonFly BSD, to this day.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe need for the FreeBSD jails came from a small shared-environment hosting provider\u0027s (R\u0026amp;D Associates, Inc.\u0027s owner, Derrick T. Woolworth) desire to establish a clean, clear-cut separation between their own services and those of their customers, mainly for security and ease of administration (jail(8)). Instead of adding a new layer of fine-grained configuration options, the solution adopted by Poul-Henning Kamp was to compartmentalize the system \u2013 both its files and its resources \u2013 in such a way that only the right people are given access to the right compartments.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETopics covered in this course:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u0027Mastering Jails\u0027 course covers most of the Jails setup options available and required for running Jails in real live scenarios.

It slows your reading pace and distracts you from the ideas you\u2019re trying to convey.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat Constitutes Good Writing\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReaders want you to get to the point. They\u2019re busy. They have other media competing for their attention. Make it easy and enjoyable for them to glide through your paragraphs. Good writing is simple. It\u2019s easy to understand. It lacks unnecessary complexity. The vocabulary is varied but not pretentious. Weed out extra words to improve clarity. Get rid of redundancies, cliches and fluff. Delete energy-sapping words like: very, really, just, quite and rather. What makes writing even more interesting than its style is its substance. Focus on content over craft. Deliver your message in its purest form. Your content will pack more power and inspire a greater response.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Art of Persuasion Begins With Good Copy\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThink of your copy\u2013whether for an ad, brochure or website\u2013as your secret salesperson. Its job, much like a salesperson\u2019s, is to persuade the reader to buy your product or service. Be sure it will make a favorable impression, one that is consistent with your branding. In today\u2019s media-rich world, there\u2019s no shortage of messages competing for your customers\u2019 attention.

You can be the best copywriter in the world but if you\u2019re ineffective at selling, you won\u2019t succeed. You also need to understand how businesses operate. Those are all basic questions that you\u2019ll be considering for each new client you get and the answers will help inform your copywriting for that client. In addition to those skills, you need to have a desire to learn. So much of copywriting involves research and learning about your clients and their industries.

Do children today use their imaginations as much as we did when we were kids? Do you see your children spinning incredible tales and stories in their fantasy play as we used to when we played \u201Ccops and robbers\u201D or \u201Chouse\u201D? Or does your child\u2019s fantasy play seem to consist only of repetitive movements which have no story to them? I am sure you are aware of such a situation\u2026 Nowadays children are no longer as creative as they once were.\u0026nbsp; We live in an era obsessed with numbers, data, and test scores, especially as they apply to our kids and their education.\u0026nbsp; Seeing the decline in creativity should make us concerned about our children\u2019s capacities to innovate, problem-solve, and navigate new and unfamiliar situations. \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the world of child development, you may hear the phrases like \u201Ccritical thinking skills\u201D and \u201Ccreative problem-solving abilities\u201D when referring to goals for your child\u2019s cognitive development. What we are really talking about is\u2026 imagination. The way to create human beings with imagination is to provide them with opportunities to develop it for themselves when they are very young. These opportunities are found in one place and one place only\u2026 that is, play. Played with paints, playing with play dough, costumes, glue, and crayons. Making a mess. Exploring the woods. Splashing in a puddle. Wondering at a caterpillar you notice inching by you. Pretending to be a bird, gliding through the sky. All of these involve a great deal of imagination and development of their creative skills to many folds.\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, as parents, we must first learn the process of creative learning which we can offer to our kids. We parents should make ourselves aware of the different aspects of creative learning and critical thinking skills so that we can create an environment for our children to flourish in that environment.\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; In this course, we are going to discuss in detail the step-by-step process which you can walk your children through to make them creative learners and achievers. We have included many exercises and divided the course into 8 sections, each section focusing on the different aspects of creative learning for your child.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIn this course, we will help you understand the child\u2019s psychology and you can help them in their creative journey.

These \u0022units\u0022 can be customers, orders, products, or any other relevant metric. Analyzing unit economics helps companies and experts assess the sustainability and profitability of their operations.  Here\u0027s why learning about unit economics is crucial for both experts and companies:","Sustainability and Profitability Assessment: Unit economics provide a clear view of whether a business is sustainable and profitable. By examining the revenue generated and the costs incurred on a per-unit basis, experts and companies can evaluate if they are making money or losing it with each sale or customer acquisition.  Scaling Decisions: Understanding unit economics is vital for making informed decisions about scaling a business. If the cost to acquire a customer is higher than the revenue generated from that customer over time, it may not be sustainable to scale the business without making changes.","Business Model Optimization: Unit economics analysis allows experts and companies to identify areas for optimization. It helps in finding cost-effective ways to acquire and retain customers, reduce operational costs, and increase average revenue per unit.  Investor Confidence: For startups and growing companies, demonstrating positive unit economics is often essential to attract investors. It shows that the business model is sound and has the potential for long-term profitability.","Risk Management: By understanding unit economics, companies can identify potential risks early. If the per-unit cost is too high, it may lead to financial instability or bankruptcy in the long run.  Pricing Strategies: Unit economics are key in setting appropriate pricing for products or services. Companies can determine the right balance between pricing and costs to maximize profitability.  Strategic Decision-Making: Business decisions related to product development, marketing campaigns, and resource allocation should be guided by a deep understanding of unit economics. It helps in focusing resources on high-impact areas.","Developing skills related to unit economics can be highly beneficial for building a career in various fields, including business, finance, and entrepreneurship:  Entrepreneurship: Entrepreneurs who understand unit economics can create and refine business models that are more likely to succeed. This knowledge is crucial for securing funding and effectively managing their startups.  Finance and Investment: Professionals in finance and investment need to evaluate the financial health of companies. An understanding of unit economics helps them assess the viability of potential investments.","Marketing and Sales: Marketers can make informed decisions about customer acquisition channels and campaigns based on the cost to acquire a customer and the customer\u0027s lifetime value.
