This course teaches students how to create modern, interactive web pages using the Bootstrap framework and React JavaScript library. The course starts with an introduction into Bootstrap with a focus on its reputation in the development community as the number one choice for mobile-first front-end web frameworks. Bootstrap is a well documented collection of reusable code written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We start with exploring the foundations of Bootstrap, including embedding it into projects, and building out the basic Bootstrap page structure. From there we catapult into the infamous Bootstrap grid system, along with the commonly used three column web page layout. After the introductory topics, students learn to work with a number of components from typography, tables and image styling right up to wells, alerts, and buttons. As part of the course we demonstrate how to build out intricate navigation menus using dropdown, collapse, accordion, and pill menus. We will also cover form styling, carousels, modals, scrollspy and just about every other Bootstrap component that\u2019s instrumental to your journey as a front-end developer. The module concludes with a hands-on project, where students will use a Bootstrap theme to build a stunning web page from scratch.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn the second section of the course, we explore React. React, also known as React JS, is a powerful JavaScript library used for building custom, interactive user interfaces using UI components. Similar to Bootstrap, React is a well documented free and open source library. The project was founded by Meta and a network of independent developers. In this section, students learn how to use the React library through a series of hands-on projects. The React section of this course starts off with a hands-on project where you\u2019ll learn how to work with functional React components, props, Callback functions, OnClick Events, and the React State hook to build a fully functional calculator. From there we will dive into project number two, where you will build a connect-4 clone. Here we will cover more intermediate concepts including passing props, destructuring, passing arguments to click events, various styling methods, and handling callbacks. You will also learn about the React key property, React lifecycle events, and conditional rendering. By the end you will have built a complete multi and single player connect-4 game board with built-in AI capabilities. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn the final section of the course we further unleash the power of React by building out a complete e-commerce site with multiple product categories, a product showcase, shopping cart feature, and much more. Here, we introduce a number of integral new concepts including: JSON server, Fetch API, and installing React router. These essential building blocks will be used to render the product categories, style the product list, and configure the product details page. From there we dive into styled components, refactoring the shop layout, and exploring the concept of \u201Ccontext\u201D in React. In the final stages of the project students will configure the shopping cart basket, and the checkout feature. We will also implement a product search feature, followed by in-depth exercises on validating input forms in React.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAs you can see this course covers a tremendous bit of ground. Best of all it features Tim Maclachlan - a renowned senior full-stack developer with over 20 years of commercial development experience.

React, also known as React JS, is a powerful JavaScript library used for building custom, interactive user interfaces using UI components. Some of the most well known examples of organizations using React for their front-end include Netflix, Facebook, and Airbnb. Developed and maintained by Meta along with a community of independent developers, React remains free and open-source. React is a component based library built entirely on JavaScript, which makes it perfect for designing complex UI\u2019s. With React, developers can build encapsulated components that efficiently manage their own state and render UI updates specifically when data changes. For example, think of the automated content refresh feature you see on a twitter feed, or facebook like button. Here the state of the UI component changes on the page, without having to manually refresh when the data is updated. This is just one small, yet powerful feature of React.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThrough a complete hands-on project, this course will teach you all the fundamental principles of React that you must know to become a proficient React developer. We start right from the basics, including the tools needed to get started. From there we dive into JSX, functional components, props, callbacks, and various OnClick events. By this stage, the calculator will have a complete visual display, coupled with functional arithmetic operations. Students then move on to passing parameters in Callback functions, using the React State Hook, and debugging.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn addition to the hands-on React module, we also offer a comprehensive overview of JavaScript for those who need a refresher. Here we start with introducing students to the document object model (DOM) which defines the logical structure of HTML documents. From there we dive into JavaScript to demonstrate various methods in which DOM elements can be manipulated to add interactivity to static components. We start right from the basics, which includes JavaScript placement, and data output. From there we move on to variable declaration, arithmetic operations, operator precedence, data types, and objects. Once the foundations are covered, we move on to more complex operations using Arrays, Conditional Statements, JavaScript comparison operators, booleans and loops. Here students will learn to unleash the true power of JavaScript to render different outcomes based on user interaction. We will explore the use of functions to efficiently handle repetitive tasks and JavaScript events to handle output based on actions and occurrences. The section will conclude with a hands-on project where students will implement their knowledge to build a web based photo gallery and background color changer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/build-a-custom-e-commerce-site-in-react-javascript-basics/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4789922_401f.jpg","duration":"7 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"36,634.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Students interested in learning the Foundations of JavaScript","Students interested in learning the Foundations of ReactJS Library","Students interested in Building Interactive UI Components using React","Students interested in learning how to build a fully customized E-Commerce Site in React"],"tags":["JavaScript","React JS"],"rating":{"count":142,"averageValue":"4.2"},"instructors":[{"name":"YouAccel Training","url":"/user/youaccel/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.214286}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"YOUACCEL75596","originalPrice":"\u20B91,999","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"1 day","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/facebook-ads-2021/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":2844664,"title":"Best of Facebook Ads: Facebook Ads 2023 Ultimate Pro Edition","shortDescription":"Be a Facebook Ads Consultant - Profit with Facebook Ads: 2023\u0027s Most Powerful Fast Learn Facebook \u0026 Instagram Ads Course","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EUpskill Yourself and ensure you\u0027re never out of Work or out of Clients, with The Best of Facebook Ads, Instagram Ads, WhatsApp Ads \u0026amp; Messenger Ads Pro Edition 2023.

This course has three main objectives, the first one is to utilise AI text to image generator to create cool designs for your jewelry products, the second one is to set up your online store and connect it with your jewelry suppliers, meanwhile, the third one is to build your brand and promote your products by running ads on Tiktok and Pinterest. Therefore, you will gain a lot of valuable knowledge about the jewelry business which hopefully will prepare you to start your own. In the introduction session, you will learn how jewelry print on demand business models works, you will get to know the full step by step process from selecting your product, adding design to the product all the way to product fulfilment which will be taken care by the suppliers. In addition to that, you will also learn a little bit about jewelry market statistics and understanding why selling jewelry in particular is a good business model and has a huge potential in the market. Then, you will also learn several effective strategies to find high quality and trustworthy suppliers since your business and your customer satisfaction will be mostly dependent on your suppliers. Afterward, you will learn how to perform market and product research using a tool called Insight Factory which you can use to conduct extensive analysis on your competitors. This section is very essential as it allows you to identify high demand products in the market and relevant keywords to be used in your product description. Then, you will enter the project section where you will be guided step by step on how to set up the business, firstly, you will learn how to use Leonardo AI which is an AI text to image generator to create multiple designs for your jewelry products, then, in the next section you will learn step by step on how to add those designs to your jewelry products, we will use several print on demand suppliers like Printify, Zazzle, and Shine On. The good news here is you will be able to customise your products however you want, you can change the colour, you can add text, and even add images to your jewelry products. Once you are done designing your products, you will have two options, the first one is to sell your jewelry on big marketplaces or build your own online store. Definitely, there are pros and cons for each option, so, in the next section, we are going to have a discussion about which one is the best for you depending on your long term goal for the business. Then, you will also learn several efficient pricing strategies and get to know the profit margin percentage that you should take.

Well, there are many answers to that question, however. I believe these are two main answers that I can give you, firstly, jewelry has always been associated with luxury, therefore, you will enable you to build high perceived value brands which means you can take higher profit margin, and my second answer is jewelry has a huge global market size, approximately $341 B which basically means that the demand for this product in the market will always be there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow are things that you can expect to learn in this course:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn basic fundamentals of jewelry print on demand business model, such as getting to know the market statistics and the overall process from selecting supplier to order fulfilment\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to find high quality and reliable jewelry suppliers by evaluating product quality, reputation, review, and lead times\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to do market and product research using Alura IO\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to generate cool designs for jewelries using Leonardo AI\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to add designs and customise necklaces, bracelets, earrings on Printify, Shine On, Zazzle, Awkward Styles, OWNprint, and Dreamship\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to import jewelry product from Printify store to Etsy marketplace\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to import jewelry products from Awkward Styles and Dreamships to Shopify store\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to customise Shopify store and add themes\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECase study: analysing pros and cons of selling jewelry on marketplaces vs your own online store\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to price your jewelry products competitively in the market\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn several marketing strategies to reach more potential customers, such as social media promotion, user generated content, influencer shoutout, building email lists, and running ads\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to set up Tiktok Ads campaign to promote jewelry products\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to set up Pinterest Ads campaign to promote jewelry products\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/print-on-demand-designing-custom-jewelry-with-ai/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5574034_1c6f.jpg","duration":"3 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"1,974.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["People who are interested in starting jewelry print on demand business","People who are interested in building E-commerce brand and finding the right suppliers"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":0,"averageValue":"0.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"Christ Raharja","url":"/user/christ-raharja/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":0}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"FA0E82CC140966C250AC","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"2 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-python-from-scratch-its-usage-by-nasa-in-mars-rovers/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4587812,"title":"Python Programming Complete Beginners Course Bootcamp 2023","shortDescription":"2023 Complete Python Bootcamp || Python Beginners to advanced || Python Master Class || Mega Course","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EThis course is designed to brush up basics in Python programming and Show how python is used in Space sciences.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDelving into the world of coding can be intimidating.

It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E*\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E javascript course contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript introduction\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript array\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript variables\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript functions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript objects\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript control statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript cookies\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript loop statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript data structures\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript error handling\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript regular expressions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003Esection 4- learn PHP\u0026nbsp;programming language\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis section will learn the basic structure of a web application and how a web browser interacts with a web server.

We will provide practice QuickBooks files for different options related to the items listed above and explore the pros and cons of each option. The bookkeeping options will help tailor our system to our specific bookkeeping needs. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs we enter accounting data into the system we will discuss common questions we will have when entering the first few months of data and how to write down these questions, move forward with data input, and organize the financial data so that we can quickly go back to it once our client questions are answered. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis course will discuss, print, and export month end and year end reports, reports a bookkeeper may provide to clients monthly and reports the business will need at year-end for tax preparation. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe will discuss year-end adjusting entries. The bookkeeping system we propose will depend on an outside accounting firm, tax preparer, or CPA firm to help with the year-end adjusting entries. As bookkeepers we want to be aware of the adjusting entry process so we can work with any year-end accounting firm, tax preparer, or CPA firm. We will enter common adjusting entries into an adjusting entry Excel worksheet and into Quickbooks. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe course will then compare and contrast our different bookkeeping methods and show how those different bookkeeping decisions reconcile to the same numbers after the adjusting entry process. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, we will discuss whether or not to enter the year-end adjusting entries into our QuickBooks bookkeeping system and different options to do so. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to the instructional videos, this course will include downloadable\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u2022\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 QuickBooks Backup files\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u2022\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 Excel practice files\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u2022\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 Downloadable PDF Files\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe QuickBooks backup files are a great tool that allows us to jump ahead in the material or to rework material if we choose. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExcel practice files will be preformatted and will generally have at least two tabs, one tab with the completed work and a second tab with a preformatted worksheet we can fill in as we watch the instructional videos.\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWho will we be learning from?\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou will be learning from somebody who has technical experience in accounting concepts and in accounting software like QuickBooks, as well as experience teaching and putting together curriculum.\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou will be learning from somebody who is a:\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u2022\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 CPA \u2013 Certified Public Accountant\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u2022\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 CGMA \u2013 Chartered Global Management Accountant\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u2022\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 Master of Science in Taxation\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u2022\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 CPS \u2013 Certifies Post-Secondary Instructor\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u2022\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 Curriculum Development Export\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a practicing CPA the instructor has worked with many technical accounting issues and helped work through them and discuss them with clients of all levels.\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a CPA and professor, the instructor has taught many accounting classes and worked with many students in the fields of accounting, business, and business applications.\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe instructor also has a lot of experience designing courses and learning how students learn best and how to help students achieve their objectives.
