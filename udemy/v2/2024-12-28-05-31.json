This Microcontroller is called\u0026nbsp;DigiSpark.\u0026nbsp;It is a microcontroller\u0026nbsp;based on the Attiny85 development board. It is similar to Arduino but smaller and more powerful in terms of\u0026nbsp;hacking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstalling backdoors, exfiltrating documents, or capturing credentials is incredibly easy with a seemingly innocent USB drive called the USB\u0026nbsp; Rubber Ducky. An Expert hacker with a few minutes, photographic memory,\u0026nbsp; and perfect typing accuracy can use a few well-crafted keystrokes to hack virtually anything they have physical access to. However, the proper hardware can do the same thing every time on demand without fail.\u0026nbsp; That\u2019s where the Rubber Ducky and other Human Interface Devices (HID)\u0026nbsp; come into play. They inject keystrokes at superhuman speeds, violating computers\u0027 inherent trust in humans by posing as a keyboard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this class, we\u2019ll learn more about what HID attacks are, how they work,\u0026nbsp; the social engineering that can be involved in their deployment, and how to use them in your Pen-testing engagements. Keyboards announce themselves to computers as HID devices and are in turn automatically recognized and accepted. We\u0027ll program a microcontroller in Arduino to take advantage of this by acting as an HID device. We can then create scripts that run when the device is plugged into a target computer.

We\u0027ll go over creating more advanced loads, including tracking payloads that run in the background, as well as Rickroll payloads that can be used with permission from friends and family to demonstrate how HID attacks work. Additionally, students learn to automate nearly anything on an unattended device which can be extremely useful when you need to run the same commands on a series of computers.\u0026nbsp; That\u2019s how the Original USB Ruber Ducky was invented. Hak5 founder\u0026nbsp; Darren Kitchen, while working as a sysadmin, got tired of typing the same commands to fix printers and network shares, again and again, and the device evolved out of laziness. He programmed a development board to emulate the typing for him - and thus the keystroke injection attack was born.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0647\u0644 \u0635\u0646\u0627\u0639\u0647 \u062C\u0647\u0627\u0632 \u0631\u0627\u0628\u0631 \u062F\u0643\u064A\u061F\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u062F\u0639\u0646\u0627 \u0646\u062A\u0639\u0631\u0641 \u0639\u0644\u0649\u0026nbsp;

In this course, we will cover three main parts. The first part covers the essentials of traditional computer vision pipeline, and how to deal with images in OpenCV and Pillow libraries, including the image pre-processing pipeline like:\u0026nbsp; thresholding, denoising, blurring, filtering, edge detection,\u0026nbsp; contours...etc. We will build simple apps like Car License Plate Detection (LPD) and activity recogntion. This will lead us to the revolution that deep learning brought to the game of computer vision, turning traditional filters into learnable parameters using Convolution Neural Networks. We will cover all the basics of ConvNets, including the details of the Vanilla architecture for image classification, hyper parameters like kernels, strides, maxpool and feature maps sizes calculations. Beyond the Vanilla architecture, we also cover the state-of-the art ConvNet meta-architectures and design patters, like skip-connnections, Inception, DenseNet...etc. In the second part, we will learn how to use ConvNets to solve practical problems in different situations, with small amount of data, how to use transfer learning and the different scenarios for that, and finally how to debug and visualize the leant kernels in ConvNets. In the last part, we will learn about different CV\u0026nbsp;apps using ConvNets. We will learn about the Encoder-Decoder design pattern. We start by the task of semantic segmentation, where we will build a U-Net architecture from scratch for the Cambridge Video (CAMVID) dataset. Then we will learn about Object Detection, covering both 2-stage and one-shot architectures like SSD and YOLO. Next, we will learn how to deal with the video data using the Spatio-Temporal ConvNet architectures. Finally we will introduce 3D Deep Learning to extend ConvNets usage to deal with 3D data, like LiDAR data.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"Arabic","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/deep-learning-for-computer-vision/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4661416_29ea.jpg","duration":"10 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"8,506.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Beginner level computer vision engineer"],"tags":["Deep Learning"],"rating":{"count":250,"averageValue":"4.8"},"instructors":[{"name":"Coursat.ai Dr. Ahmad ElSallab","url":"/user/coursatai/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.76}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"DC938ECD77874BD2BE8B","originalPrice":"\u20B92,699","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/quiz-marketing-power-generate-leads-with-boosting-lead/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5491816,"title":"Quiz Marketing Power: Generate Leads for Marketing Success","shortDescription":"Learn how to grow your business and generate more leads by creating marketing quizzes with Boosting Lead tool","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIf you want to improve your marketing campaigns or learn how to generate more leads, our quiz marketing course might be for you. \u003C/strong\u003EIn the ever-changing world of lead generation, quiz marketing has become an essential component.

We will demonstrate how Deep Learning has re-shaped this area of Artificial Intelligence using concepts like word vectors and embeddings, strucutured deep learning, collaborative filtering, recurrent neural networks, sequence-to-sequence models and transformer networks. In our journey, we will be mostly concerned with how to represent the language tokens, being at the word or character level, and and how to represent their aggregation, like sentences or documents, in a semantically sound way. We start the journey by going through the traditional pipeline of text pre-processing and the different text features like binary and TF-IDF\u0026nbsp;features with the Bag-of-Words model. Then we will dive into the concepts of word vectors and embeddings as a general deep learning concept, with detailed discussion of famous word embedding techniques like word2vec, GloVe, Fasttext and ELMo. This will enable us to divert into recommender systems, using collaborative filtering and twin-tower model as an example of the generic usage of embeddings beyond word representations. In the second part of the course, we will be concerned with sentence and sequence representations. We will tackle the core NLP of Langauge Modeling, at statistical and neural levels, using recurrent models, like LSTM\u0026nbsp;and GRU. In the following part, we tackle sequence-to-sequence models, with the flagship NLP\u0026nbsp;task of Machine Translation, which paves the way to talk about many other tasks under the same design seq2seq pattern, like Question-Answering and Chatbots. We present the core idea idea of Attention mechanisms with recurrent seq2seq, before we generalize it as a generic deep learning concept. This generalization leads to the to the state-of-the art Transformer Network, which revolutionized the world of NLP, using full attention mechanisms. In the final part of the course, we present the ImageNet moment of NLP, where Transfer Learning comes into play together with pre-trained Transfomer architectures like BERT, GPT 1-2-3, RoBERTa, ALBERT, XLTransformer and XLNet.\u0026nbsp; \u003C/p\u003E","language":"Arabic","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/deep-learning-for-natural-language-processing/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4663084_3dd8.jpg","duration":"11 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"11,789.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Beginner level NLP engineers and data scientists"],"tags":["Deep Learning"],"rating":{"count":305,"averageValue":"4.6"},"instructors":[{"name":"Coursat.ai Dr. Ahmad ElSallab","url":"/user/coursatai/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.584746}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"25686B76F52544BD998B","originalPrice":"\u20B92,299","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/presentations-with-chatgpt/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":6207903,"title":"Presentations with ChatGPT","shortDescription":"Supercharge Your Presentations: ChatGPT-Generated Outlines, Automation, and Design","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECourse Description: Presentations with ChatGPT\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to \u0022Presentations with ChatGPT,\u0022 an innovative and comprehensive course designed to revolutionize how you create and deliver presentations.

It starts with setting the boundaries of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and their relation to Data Science. What is expected as a member an AI team, and how to speak the same language. What is possible and what is not, and what defines a good AI project. The basics of supervised learning are covered, including the main ingredients of the Machine Learning problem, and the different solution setups. We cover both Linear models (Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM)) and Non-linear models (Polynomial Regression, Kernel SVM, Deep Neural Networks (DNN)). A universal approach is given to tackle any ML problem in a systematic way, covering data preparation, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Model selection, Model evaluation, Model design, Fine tuning and Regularization. An end-to-end is given to illustrate this process with code in Google Colab Notebooks. We also cover the Machine Learning Meta algorithms and Ensemble methods: Voting, BAGGing, Boosting Decision Trees and Random Forests.

This includes terms like ROI (Return on Investment), KPIs (Key Performance Indicators), and other jargon specific to various business sectors.  Formal Tone:  Business communication often requires a more formal tone compared to everyday conversations. Learning how to structure emails, reports, and presentations in a professional manner is crucial for effective communication within a corporate environment.  Cultural Sensitivity:  Business English teaches cultural nuances that are essential for global communication. Understanding how to navigate cross-cultural communication ensures that professionals can collaborate effectively with colleagues, clients, and partners from diverse backgrounds.","Effective Writing Skills:  Business English emphasizes clear and concise writing. Professionals need to be able to convey complex ideas in a straightforward manner, whether it\u0027s in emails, reports, or proposals. Clarity in communication helps in avoiding misunderstandings and ensures that the intended message is delivered accurately.  Negotiation and Persuasion:  Business English equips individuals with skills in negotiation and persuasion. This is crucial in scenarios such as contract discussions, sales pitches, or team collaborations, where the ability to articulate ideas and convince others is paramount.  Presentation Skills:  Professionals often need to present their ideas or reports to colleagues, clients, or superiors. Business English focuses on effective presentation skills, including organizing content, using appropriate visual aids, and engaging the audience.","Networking:  Building professional connections is a vital aspect of career growth. Business English provides the tools to engage in networking effectively, whether it\u0027s during conferences, meetings, or social events. This skill is crucial for establishing relationships that can contribute to career advancement.  Career Advancement:  Learning Business English and Communications can significantly contribute to career advancement. Professionals who can communicate effectively in a business context are more likely to be considered for leadership roles, promotions, and opportunities that require strong interpersonal and communication skills.  Global Business Environment:  In today\u0027s interconnected world, many businesses operate on a global scale. Proficiency in Business English is essential for professionals working with international clients, partners, or colleagues, enabling smoother collaboration and reducing the risk of miscommunication.","In conclusion, the mastery of Business English and Communications is integral for individuals looking to succeed in the professional arena.
