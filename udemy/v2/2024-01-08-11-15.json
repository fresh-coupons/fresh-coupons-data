The third project is all about building a URL shortening service and that\u0027s pretty simple and yet very practical. We are going to use a bit of Jquery on the way. For the fourth project, which is the largest one of them all, where we are going to integrate our code from the past project (auth system) and we are going to insert images and display them nicely. And that only leaves us with only one project, and that is the email sender that\u0027s one of the most important parts of any kind of development because it will teach you to send emails dynamically. And that\u0027s actually it.

This method minimizes downtime, as the service remains available during the deployment. However, if issues arise with the new version, rolling back is not instant and can be complex.

Perform A/B testing, and test your application periodically after the deployment is complete.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs a strategy where two or more versions of the application are deployed simultaneously, and traffic is split between them. This model is typically used for testing user response to new features or changes. It\u0027s more about gathering data and insights rather than quick rollback capabilities. In case of any issues with the new version, an immediate switch back to the old version isn\u0027t the primary focus of A/B testing, making it less ideal for situations requiring rapid response to deployment problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EC.

If this initial release proves successful, the new version is then rolled out to the entire user base. The advantage of this approach is that it reduces the risk of a faulty update affecting all users at once, as any problems can be identified and fixed during the initial, smaller release. However, like A/B testing, canary deployments don\u0027t emphasize instant rollback. If the new version encounters issues, rolling back to the old version across the entire user base would not be as immediate as needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECorrect answer:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ED.

After deploying the green version, traffic is switched over from blue to green. If the new version encounters any problems, traffic can be instantly reverted back to the blue environment. This approach greatly minimizes downtime and risk, as the old version remains operational and can be quickly reinstated if necessary. The primary downside is the need for double the resources, as both environments run concurrently. Despite this, the level of control and safety it offers, especially for instant rollbacks, often justifies the additional resource requirement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELinks:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApplication deployment and testing strategies\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELinks to Documentation\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the best practice exams to help you prepare for your \u003Cstrong\u003EGoogle Professional Cloud DevOps Engineer\u0026nbsp; \u003C/strong\u003Eexam.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u2022 You can retake the exams as many times as you want\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u2022 This is a huge original question bank\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u2022 You get support from instructor if you have questions\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u2022 Each question has a \u003Cstrong\u003Edetailed explanation\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u2022 Mobile-compatible with the Udemy app\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u2022 30-days money-back guarantee if you\u0027re not satisfied\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWe hope that by now you\u0027re convinced! \u003C/strong\u003EAnd there are a lot more questions inside the course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHappy learning and best of luck for yourGoogle Professional Cloud DevOps Engineer exam!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/practice-exams-google-professional-cloud-devops-engineer/","imageUri":"https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5727402_7008.jpg","duration":"185 questions","enrolledStudentsCount":"431.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["DevOps Engineers Seeking Specialization: IT professionals already working in DevOps roles, including software developers or data scientists, looking to specialize or expand their skills in DevOps on the Google Cloud Platform","Individuals Aspiring to Become DevOps Engineers: Those aiming to enter the DevOps industry, particularly with a focus on utilizing Google Cloud Platform\u0027s tools and services.","Google Cloud Certified Professionals: Individuals already holding certifications in Google Cloud Platform, eager to enrich their DevOps knowledge and add another valuable credential to their profile.","Career Transitioners: Professionals from diverse fields or industries interested in transitioning into a DevOps role, recognizing the importance of certifications in showcasing their abilities to potential employers.","DevOps Advisors: Experienced consultants providing guidance to organizations on DevOps strategies, seeking formal certification to validate their proficiency in leveraging Google Cloud Platform for DevOps practices."],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":0,"averageValue":"0.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"Alex Levkovich","url":"/user/alexey-kolev/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":0}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"047E3B3B9553A6B0E639","originalPrice":"\u20B91,999","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"2 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/the-storied-jedi-justice-equity-diversity-inclusion/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4959906,"title":"The Storied JEDI: Justice, Equity, Diversity \u0026 Inclusion","shortDescription":"Learn Justice, Equity, Diversity \u0026 Inclusion Concepts for Work through Storytelling","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EWant to cultivate a culture of justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion in your workplace?
