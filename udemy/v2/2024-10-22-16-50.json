A good hash function satisfies the following properties: it is easy to compute the hash value for any given message, it is infeasible to generate two different messages that result in the same hash value, it is infeasible to modify a message without changing its hash value, and it is infeasible to determine the original message from its hash value.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWhen used properly, hashing can be an effective way to store sensitive data such as passwords while keeping them safe from prying eyes.

Because of the high demand for Java, Java developers are also quite sought after and they hold some of the most high-paying jobs in the industry. The average salary of a Java Developer lies between \u003Cstrong\u003E$47,169 to $106,610 per year\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E2. Java is Easy to Learn:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EJava is quite easy to learn and can be understood in a short span of time as it has a syntax similar to English. You can also learn from \u003Cstrong\u003EGeeksforGeeks Java Tutorials\u003C/strong\u003E. This will guide you on how to get started with Java and make yourself proficient in it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E3. Java has a Large Community:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThere is a large online community of Java users ranging from beginner, advanced, and even expert levels that are particularly helpful in case any support is required. Some of the online communities for learning purposes are \u003Cstrong\u003EStackOverflow\u003C/strong\u003E, \u003Cstrong\u003EJava Forums\u003C/strong\u003E, etc. Also, there is a lot of resources like \u003Cstrong\u003EGeeksforGeeks\u003C/strong\u003E etc. available on the internet regarding Java.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E4. Java has an abundant API:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EJava has an abundant Application Programming Interface (API) that includes many Java classes, packages, interfaces, etc. This is useful for constructing applications without necessarily knowing their inside implementations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJava has mainly three types of API i.e. \u003Cstrong\u003EOfficial Java core API\u2019s, Optional official Java API\u2019s and Unofficial API\u2019s.\u003C/strong\u003E These API\u2019s overall are used for almost everything including networking, I/O, databases, media, XML parsing, speech synthesis, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E5. Java has multiple Open Source Libraries:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOpen-source libraries have resources that can be copied, studied, changed, shared, etc. There are multiple open-source libraries in Java such as \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJHipster, Maven, Google Guava, Apache Commons\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E, etc. that can be used to make Java development easier, cheaper and faster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E6. Java has Powerful Development Tools:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThere are many Integrated development environments (IDE\u2019s) in Java that provide various facilities for software development to programmers. Powerful Java IDE\u2019s such as \u003Cstrong\u003EEclipse, NetBeans, IntelliJ IDEA, etc.\u003C/strong\u003E play a big role in the success of Java.\u003Cbr\u003EThese IDE\u2019s provide many facilities such as debugging, syntax highlighting, code completion, language support, automated refactoring, etc. that make coding in Java easier and faster.\u003Cbr\u003EJava has created a base for the Android operating system and opted around \u003Cstrong\u003E90% of fortune 500 companies\u003C/strong\u003E to developing a lot of back-end applications. Also, it plays a great role in Apache Hadoop data processing, Amazon Web Services, and Windows Azure, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E7. Java is Free of Cost:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOne of the reasons Java is very popular among individual programmers is that it is available under the Oracle Binary Code License (BCL) free of charge. This means that Java is free for development and test environments, but for commercial purposes, a small fee is required.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E8. Java is Platform Independent:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EJava is platform-independent as the Java source code is converted to byte code by the compiler which can then be executed on any platform using the Java Virtual Machine. Java is also known as a WORA (write once, run anywhere) language because it is platform-independent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the development of most Java applications occurs in a Windows environment while they are run on a UNIX platform because of the platform-independent nature of Java.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E9. Java has great Documentation Support:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe documentation support for Java is excellent using \u003Cstrong\u003EJavadoc\u003C/strong\u003E which is the documentation generator for Java. It uses the Java source code to generate the API documentation in HTML format. So, Javadoc provides a great reference while coding in Java so that understanding the code is quite simple.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E10. Java is Versatile:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EJava is very versatile as it is used for programming applications on the web, mobile, desktop, etc. using different platforms. Also, Java has many features such as dynamic coding, multiple security features, platform-independent characteristics, network-centric designing, etc. that make it quite versatile.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to learn Java from scratch without any prior experience in programming then you should go for \u003Cstrong\u003EJava Foundation Course\u003C/strong\u003E.
