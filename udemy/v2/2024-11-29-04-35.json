It is a very diverse library and has a wide range of applications in other sectors. Numpy can be put to use along with Data Science, Data Analysis and Machine Learning.

It maintains uniformity for mathematical operations that would not be possible with heterogeneous elements.

It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are practicals of:\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E* Javascript Course Contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Array\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Variables\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Functions\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Objects\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/css-and-javascript-crash-course/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4271184_7325_2.jpg","duration":"1 total hour","enrolledStudentsCount":"118,165.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["For CSS And Beginners","For People Who want to learn CSS Fundamentals and later Transition into Web Designing","For People New to CSS And Javascript"],"tags":["CSS","JavaScript"],"rating":{"count":1749,"averageValue":"4.1"},"instructors":[{"name":"PROPER DOT INSTITUTE","url":"/user/vivek-dahibhate-2/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.0916667}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"F2A48059C93A32CD8AAC","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/java-and-c-and-php-crash-course-for-beginners/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5022262,"title":"Java And C\u002B\u002B And PHP Crash Course All in One For Beginners","shortDescription":"Get Started With C\u002B\u002B, Java And PHP Programming in This Crash Course, Learn C\u002B\u002B, Java And PHP Basics All in One Course","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGet Started With C\u002B\u002B Programming, Java Programming And PHP Programming in This Crash Course\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESection 1: C\u002B\u002B Crash Course\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis course will help you learn C\u002B\u002B basics and give you hands-on experience to create your own projects and work with computer memory.
