A successful manager is now expected to act as a leader, a mentor, and a coach, guiding their team members towards individual and collective success. This paradigm shift highlights the significance of coaching techniques in the realm of managerial responsibilities.","The Transformation of Managerial Roles  Evolving Leadership Expectations  The traditional image of a manager as a stern authority figure has given way to a more holistic view of leadership.
