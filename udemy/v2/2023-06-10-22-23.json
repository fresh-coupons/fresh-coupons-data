It assumes that you\u0027re new to the language, so it gets you started with basic functionality such as creating functions, creating variables, and calling these lines of code from your standard HTML pages. It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are practicals of:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E* Javascript Course Contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Array\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Variables\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Functions\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Objects\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Control Statements\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Cookies\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Loop statements\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESee you inside the course\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-practicals-crash-course/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4200228_c917_2.jpg","duration":"38 total mins","enrolledStudentsCount":"82,072.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["For Javascript  Programming Beginners","For People New to Javascript","For People Who want to learn Javascript Fundamentals and later Transition into Web Development"],"tags":["JavaScript"],"rating":{"count":833,"averageValue":"4.1"},"instructors":[{"name":"PROPER DOT INSTITUTE","url":"/user/vivek-dahibhate-2/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.040146}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"0AF111887DF04A360AF1","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/easy-way-to-learn-arabic-basics/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":1547478,"title":"Basics of the Arabic Language","shortDescription":"Super Easy Way To Learn Arabic Language Basics - How To","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EUpdate | Date:\u0026nbsp;November 20th, 2021. \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIf you have any questions/comments please, do not hesitate to contact me.

The delivery of a service for a cost is also considered a sale.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a real art to selling, as any salesperson probably knows. You walk a fine line between alienating the customer and making them feel comfortable. Sales is not something you can pick up right away; it takes time and practice to perfect the art of closing a deal. Developing a solid and proven technique is a big part of learning how to sell efficiently. Here are five selling techniques every salesperson should master.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAccording to Active Listening, One of the reasons that prospective clients are so wary of salespeople is because they anticipate a pushy demeanor and pressure to purchase a client. Setting out with a clear agenda and not interacting with the client beyond a fixed aim is a mistake; it won\u2019t win you sales and it definitely won\u2019t win you fans. More effective selling techniques involve active listening\u2014 allowing for a dialogue with the customer that isn\u2019t just a one-sided conversation. Listening to their concerns, questions, and hesitations will help you respond to them better, and will help the prospective client trust you more as well. People who trust you are much more likely to make a purchase with you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAccording to Warm Calls, Relying on cold calls is an ineffective sales technique; they irritate potential clients and are often screened anyway. Shifting to a warm calling is a much better\u2014and more efficient\u2014way of handling selling. Warm calls involve calling prospective clients who have been chosen for their potential to be receptive to your sales pitch. This includes \u201Cwarming up\u201D leads through things like social media outreach and prior research of the client. Warm calling leads to much higher success rates, since it does away with the scatter shot approach to selling, which is often just a waste of your time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFeatures \u0026amp; Benefits: This one may seem obvious, but it\u2019s not always efficiently carried out by the salesperson. While it\u2019s important to go over the practical functions of a product or service, simply describing the service or product and its various functions isn\u2019t enough to convince someone to make a purchase. The prospective client doesn\u2019t just need to know how it works, they need to understand why they should care. Emphasizing the features and benefits of the product, and the ways it can prove valuable to the potential client, is a classic and effective selling technique that is continually reiterated because it works. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENeeds \u0026amp; Solutions : People like practical reasons why they should invest in a product or service, and they\u2019re more likely to listen to a sales pitch if it offers an effective solution. This sales technique works best with the technique of active listening; it\u2019s important to listen to the client to get a sense of how the product could benefit them, and then tailor your pitch to that individual or company. The sense that the sales pitch has been personalized will make feel the client more comfortable trusting and listening to the salesperson, because they feel like they\u2019re learning about a solution that will work for them, not just you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAccording to Social Selling, Huge pools of potential clients are easily accessible through online social networking, and when you discourage the use of social media as a selling technique, you limit the scope of your salespeople and are potentially standing in the way of future sales. Social media and online connectivity are huge parts of modern communication, and it\u2019s important to adapt to this way of doing business. Actively encourage salespeople to reach out to potential clients and foster leads through social media sites like LinkedIn and Twitter; you\u2019re sales numbers will thank you. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this master course you will learn 5 major topics,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

Zero trust architectures simplify network infrastructure, make users happier, and keep cyberthreats at a distance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince John Kindervag, then at Forrester Research, coined the phrase, zero trust architectures follow the maxim \u0022never trust, always verify.\u0022 To block inappropriate access and lateral movement throughout an environment, zero trust architecture enforces access policies based on context\u2014including the user\u0027s role and location, the device they\u0027re using, and the data they\u0027re asking for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA zero trust architecture means you know who\u0027s using what, and you can track it, including encrypted traffic; you need to monitor and verify the traffic between parts of the environment; and you need multifactor authentication (MFA) that goes beyond passwords.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn important thing to remember is that in a zero trust architecture, a resource\u0027s location isn\u0027t as important as before. Rather than rigid network segmentation, software-defined microsegmentation protects your data, workflows, services, and such anywhere, in your data center or distributed hybrid or multicloud.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy using a network-centric data security strategy that provides specific access only to those who need it, Zero Trust Architecture focuses on the business needs and functionality of an organization. By enabling parameters to dictate access and restrictions, the Zero Trust model views data security from a whole new perspective. As opposed to legacy networks that have little to no visibility or control over network and data usage, Zero Trust Architectures see all network traffic through segmentation gateways with granular policies governing access to data, apps, and assets. There are certain rules that have to be followed before a resource can be accessed in a Zero Trust network.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe five major topics I want to cover in this master\u0027s course are\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

Electronics differs from classical electrical engineering in that it uses active devices to control electron flow via amplification and rectification, whereas classical electrical engineering only uses passive effects such as resistance, capacitance, and inductance to control electric current flow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EElectronics covers an extremely broad range of technology. Initially, the term referred to the study of electron behaviour and movement, particularly as observed in the first electron tubes. With advances in knowledge about the fundamental nature of electrons and how the motion of these particles could be utilised, it came to be used in a broader sense. Many scientific and technical disciplines now deal with various aspects of electronics. The development of key devices such as transistors, integrated circuits, lasers, and optical fibres has resulted from research in these fields. As a result, a wide range of electronic consumer, industrial, and military products can now be manufactured. Indeed, the world is in a state of flux.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EElectronic systems design is concerned with the multidisciplinary design of complex electronic devices and systems such as cell phones and computers. The topic ranges from the design and development of an electronic system (new product development) to ensuring its proper function, service life, and disposal. Electronic systems design is thus the process of defining and developing complex electronic devices to meet the user\u0027s specified requirements.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaboratory experimentation is an important part of the development of electronic devices due to the complexity of electronics theory. These experiments are used to test or validate the engineer\u0027s design and to identify errors. Historically, electronics labs were made up of physical electronics devices and equipment, but in recent years, the trend has shifted to electronics lab simulation software such as CircuitLogix, Multisim, and PSpice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/basic-electronics-multiple-choice-questions/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4507672_65e1_2.jpg","duration":"40 questions","enrolledStudentsCount":"7,520.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Students, teachers, or any one who wants to recollect basic electronics"],"tags":["Electronics"],"rating":{"count":36,"averageValue":"4.6"},"instructors":[{"name":"Mohamed Hafis","url":"/user/mhafis/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.5}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"2612C51AF7038532817F","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"3 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/thai-language-course/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5053642,"title":"Thai Language Quick Start Guide - Learn Thai Language Basics","shortDescription":"Learn Spoken Thai with this Beginners Thai Language Course to help you speak Thai for travelling or living in Thailand","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EHave you always wanted to be able speak the basics Thai Language, but you don\u0027t know how to get started?\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearning a new language can seem quite intimidating at first.

The process of writing the software itself involves the planning required for developing the product. The key principle of the RAD process is a reduction in planning to focus on a highly iterative design and construction process, enabling teams to accomplish more in less time, without impacting client satisfaction. Apart from a shorter time-to-market, one of the most significant advantages of RAD is client involvement. RAD emphasizes incremental and iterative delivery of functioning models to the client instead of following a rigid process model like the traditional SDLC. Depends on strong team and individual performances for identifying business requirements. Only system that can be modularized can be built using RAD. Requires highly skilled developers/designers. High dependency on modeling skills. Only suitable for scalable, component-based systems \u2013 RAD is best used for large systems with multiple components.

layout, the design of\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ean app, a website, even on your TV.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way that an app is designed for you to interact with video on a streaming service, for example,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethat\u0027s user interface experience is different.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow do you interact with that?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow do you click on

wireframe or prototype an app, a website, and then use the prototype\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eto run that application in XD and test it out and see how the experience is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo you can do the user interface or the design, and then you can also test it with how it would be\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewith a user experience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo it\u0027s a way for you

There is a BIG difference in the way these two types of results are ranked. With organic search results, there are many more ranking factors that you will need to consider if you want to perform well in search. When it comes to paid results, advertisers are ranked according to the amount they\u2019ll pay a single visitor, sent to them through Google\u2019s Pay Per Click Ad\u2019s network. The more they are willing to pay the higher they will rank. It\u2019s as simple as that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrganic search doesn\u2019t work in the same way. You can\u2019t pay your way to the top. Instead, you need to optimise your site, pages, and content so you score highly in Google\u2019s ranking algorithm. The good news is, when people search for information on a topic, most people trust organic search results FAR more than they trust paid results.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this video, we\u2019ll be focusing solely on organic results, and giving you tips and advice you can use to perform well in organic Google search.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy do you need SEO?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch engines will be one of the main sources of traffic to your webpage and Google is the biggest and most popular search engine, by far.

If you are struggling to achieve your goals on Amazon FBA, this course has the tools to keep you moving on the right track. A few years ago, I bought the most expensive course on the market (around $5000), but received less value than this amazing course for a few bucks. Sumner does an excellent job of breaking the content down for everyone to understand.

I purchased two courses on the same subject to get different views of the course development process. Sumner\u0027s class was excellent, full of great information, and he didn\u0027t waste a lot of time on issues that do not matter. There were a few sound issues from video to video (one loud and the next one not so loud), but other than that everything was great.!\u0022 - \u003Cem\u003EMarci S\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E \u0022Loving this course!

Sadly, I must say that I purchased this course when it was on sale, but it would definitely be worth the full price as this course is amazing. I will admit that I was one of those idiots that purchased expensive courses for learning Amazon FBA. Other than a few courses on Udemy I also purchased a course at $400 and purchased a mentorship at $1,350 and then purchased another course on Amazon and Ranking that was $5,000. The funny thing is, is that I keep coming back to this course to learn. This course far surpasses the value of the other courses I had purchased and it was not even 1/4th the price.\u201D\u003C/em\u003E - Eric N\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u0022Wow! I cannot recommend this course highly enough. I can\u2019t believe how much Ali and Sumner packed into it, it was full of easy to understand, practical information on how to step up your Etsy store from A-Z. I just took another course on Udemy for succeeding on Etsy which I was really highly rated, it was a lot shorter and I after it I thought I knew all I needed to know to get a great start but at the last minute thought I\u2019d check this course out too, I couldn\u2019t put my lap top away, seriously guys thank you so much, I barely learnt anything from that first course! I\u2019m so pumped to get started now!!!\u0022 - \u003Cem\u003EJanelle T\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u201CIt is kind of hard to describe the quantity of information Sumner communicates in this course. It\u0027s a long course (19.5hrs). During the whole time Sumner is fresh, prepared and he clearly explains all topics. And I mean ALL topics. He covers all areas of Amazon FBA but then goes further with pointers to other aspects of e-commerce which you can explore. I have an amazing number of new bookmarks pointing to critical tools in my browser and a huge number of bookmarks within the course. The bookmarks within the course will be my guideposts to go back and review topics as they come up in my business, which I\u0027m sure they will. If you are going to do Amazon FBA take this course. It will take you a while to go through it but you will thank the e-commerce spirits for guiding you to it. Best of luck and Here\u0027s to a prosperous year.
