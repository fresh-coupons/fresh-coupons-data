He makes every other course seem like a prologue and I know I am going to be the confident, well prepared speaker that I always sought to become. The magnitude of material and the pieces of golden wisdom are so practical to today\u0027s environment. It hardly seems possible that a teacher of this quality would be so giving and available to the average person like myself, when he is qualified to coach Kings and Dignitaries. Only one-third through the course and already my Charity fundraising efforts are more effective because I have gained skills to improve my communication, both my message and my delivery. The clarity of TJ Walker\u0027s delivery demonstrates his message in action. Follow him on Facebook and YouTube for greater depth if you find yourself improving from absorbing his work as I have. Do the assignments promptly and you will improve with each session. Worth the investment of time and that is what I value most, TJ WALKER delivered value with each session, and made the most of my time.\u0022\u0026nbsp;Debbie Tudor\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat others say about the instructor:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u201CTJ Walker\u0027s single-minded devotion to presentation has made him the #1 expert for executives seeking guidance on speaking to the public and media.\u0022 \u003Cem\u003EBob Bowdon, Anchor/Reporter, Bloomberg Television\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u201CTJ Walker is the leading media trainer in the world.\u0022 \u003Cem\u003EStu Miller, Viacom News Producer\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(TJ Walker\u0027s Media Training Worldwide) \u201CThe world\u0027s leading presentation and media training firm.\u0022\u003Cem\u003EGregg Jarrett, Fox News Channel Anchor\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/how-to-deliver-an-elevator-pitch/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/364026_36eb_2.jpg","duration":"10 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"28,037.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Entrepreneurs ","Job seekers","Executives"],"tags":["Communication Skills","Investor Pitching","Personal Branding"],"rating":{"count":199,"averageValue":"4.4"},"instructors":[{"name":"TJ Walker","url":"/user/tjwalker2/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.35},{"name":"Media Training Worldwide Digital","url":"/user/media-training-worldwide-digital/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.35}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"4A78C6FD214B9D2AB310","originalPrice":"\u20B92,299","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/how-to-give-a-one-on-one-presentation/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":363958,"title":"Presentation Skills Training: Great One on One Presentations","shortDescription":"Presentation Skills - You can communicate your message, make a great impression, create a real conversation, every time.","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp; \t\u003Cstrong\u003EPresentation skills\u003C/strong\u003E for one on one presentations.\u0026nbsp;Imagine that every time you give a one on one presentation, the other person comes away with a strong and positive sense of what you are about, what your message is, and why they should help you.

Because the skill you are learning is speaking related, it only makes sense that you learn through speaking.\u0026nbsp; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp; \tThe skill you will learn in this class is not primarily theoretical or academic. It is a skill that requires physical habits. That is why you will be asked to take part in numerous exercises where you record yourself speaking on video, and then watching yourself. Learning presentation skills is like learning how to ride a bicycle. You simply have to do it numerous times and work past the wobbling and falling off parts until you get it right.\u0026nbsp; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp; \tThis \u003Cstrong\u003Epublic speaking\u003C/strong\u003E\u0026nbsp;course contains numerous video lectures plus several bonus books for your training library.\u0026nbsp; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp; \tTJ Walker has been coaching and training people on their presentation skills for 30 years. Now, through the power of Udemy\u0027s online platform, he is able to give you the same high quality training that he gives in person to CEOs, Fortune 500 executives, and Presidents of countries. Only you can now receive the training at a tiny fraction of the normal fee for in-person training.\u0026nbsp; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp; \tHow long this \u003Cstrong\u003Epublic speaking\u0026nbsp;course\u003C/strong\u003E takes is up to you. The longest part of the course involves you speaking on video, critiquing yourself, and doing it over until you like it. But if you get to the point where you love how you look and sound when you present it will be well worth the time spent. And having this skill will save you time for all future presentations in your life.\u0026nbsp; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp; \tYou can begin improving your presentation skills right now.

So he is giving us an actual example of the very thing that he is talking about. His expressions and gestures are perfectly suited to the points he is making. And his pronunciation is very clear and easy to understand. Also his sentences are spoken with the emphasis in the right places. This course is designed for native speakers of English. The same basic principles could probably be applied in a course designed for non-native speakers. I would like to see such a course someday. I am really enjoying this course.
