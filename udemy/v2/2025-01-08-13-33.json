Linux is typically packaged in a Linux distribution. Distributions include the Linux kernel and supporting system software and libraries, many of which are provided by the GNU Project. Many Linux distributions use the word \u0022Linux\u0022 in their name, but the Free Software Foundation uses the name \u0022GNU/Linux\u0022 to emphasize the importance of GNU software, causing some controversy. Linux has grown to become a major force in computing - powering everything from the New York Stock Exchange to mobile phones, supercomputers, and consumer devices.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPopular Linux distributions include Debian, Fedora, and Ubuntu. Commercial distributions include Red Hat Enterprise Linux and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server. Desktop Linux distributions include a windowing system such as X11 or Wayland and a desktop environment such as GNOME or KDE Plasma. Distributions intended for servers may omit graphics altogether or include a solution stack such as LAMP. Because Linux is freely redistributable, anyone may create a distribution for any purpose.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe will learn:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Introduction to Linux\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Linux\u0026nbsp; Distributions\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Installing Ubuntu\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) File system Structure\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Installing software applications\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) How to get help in Linux (Manuals)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7) Basic Operations in Linux (cd, cat, ls, mkdir, rmdir, exit, pwd, whereis, tail, head, etc)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8) System log \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9) File Permissions\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10) Editors (nano/vi)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E11) Bash Shell Scripting (interactive script, functions, parameters, if-else loop, boolean, case, for loop, while loop and until loop)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat You\u0027ll Gain:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECore Linux Mastery\u003C/strong\u003E: Learn how to navigate the Linux filesystem, manage users, automate tasks, and secure your systems like a pro.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHigh-Demand IT Skills\u003C/strong\u003E: Discover how to efficiently manage Linux servers, optimize performance, and troubleshoot issues, setting you up for \u003Cstrong\u003Ehigh-paying job opportunities\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWho Should Enroll:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis course is perfect for:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIT Professionals \u0026amp; System Administrators\u003C/strong\u003E who want to upskill and optimize their Linux systems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDevelopers \u0026amp; DevOps Engineers\u003C/strong\u003E looking to streamline workflows, automate tasks, and scale their infrastructure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETech Enthusiasts \u0026amp; Aspiring IT Specialists\u003C/strong\u003E aiming to kickstart a rewarding career with one of the most sought-after skills in the industry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u2019t miss out on your chance to \u003Cstrong\u003Ebecome a Linux powerhouse\u003C/strong\u003E and unlock endless career opportunities. \u003Cstrong\u003EEnroll now\u003C/strong\u003E and start your journey toward mastering Linux today!\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/linux-for-data-engineers-hands-on/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4368656_0f79_2.jpg","duration":"2 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"25,101.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Software Engineer, Software Developer, Big Data Engineer, Data Engineer, Data Analyst, Data Scientist, Machine Learning Engineer","IT Professionals \u0026 System Administrators who want to upskill and optimize their Linux systems.","Developers \u0026 DevOps Engineers looking to streamline workflows, automate tasks, and scale their infrastructure.","Tech Enthusiasts \u0026 Aspiring IT Specialists aiming to kickstart a rewarding career with one of the most sought-after skills in the industry."],"tags":["Big Data","Linux","Ubuntu"],"rating":{"count":144,"averageValue":"3.7"},"instructors":[{"name":"Bigdata Engineer","url":"/user/bhavesh-bhadricha/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":3.98}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"F315703532AB846B96BF","originalPrice":"\u20B91,499","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/kubernetes-training/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":2724456,"title":"Kubernetes with HELM: Kubernetes for Absolute Beginners","shortDescription":"Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) | GKE \u0026 CKA Deep Dive | Production grade K8s with HELM from Scratch","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EThis course on \u003Cstrong\u003EKubernetes Certification Suitable for\u0026nbsp; Beginners\u003C/strong\u003E was primarily designed with beginners in mind with Hands-On Labs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll learn a lot of \u003Cstrong\u003EDevOps Kubernetes workflow hands-on\u003C/strong\u003E in this course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis \u003Cstrong\u003EKubernetes Administrator \u003C/strong\u003Eallows you to demonstrate that you have the skills necessary to build and manage Kubernetes environments.
