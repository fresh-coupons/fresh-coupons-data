Products look better than ever, interfaces feel intuitive, and companies are hiring designers at an increasing rate. But, the designer\u2019s role has been changing over the last few years.

He\u0027s not simply some guy who\u0027s always liked to draw, got a microphone for Christmas and thought it\u0027d be cool to make a course. I regard myself as an exceptionally unexceptional draftsman but can already sense some improvement in the way I\u0027m tackling portraits.The value I\u0027ve already received leaves me with absolutely no complaints. You\u0027ll be getting A LOT of information from a guy who knows what he\u0027s doing with this course. And the demos - from blank sheet of paper to finished, fully rendered drawing - are both highly informative and inspirational. I\u0027m not sure you can ask for more than that from any instructor. It\u0027s a keeper. Many Thanks, Mr P for putting this together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u2013Sam Pollard\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf all the elements of drawing, portraiture is one of the most difficult to master. Practice alone is not enough to create portraits that come alive. That is the core value of this course. It provides a strong foundation for the individual to begin to master the creation of portraits of substance. This is not a course for the lazy. It requires patience and practice. But it will provide a roadmap that will allow the student to create fulfilling and satisfying portraits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u2013Stuart Givot\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn Excellent Course.

He provided some incredible insights into helping me improve my facial drawing skills. It\u0027s amazing of how easy and simple he teaches technique. I feel inspired and highly recommend his courses. I can\u0027t wait to learn more from him!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u2013Tuese Ahkiong\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is a clear, deep and well made course. Chris\u0027s sense of art teaching is excellent, it\u0027s like hanging out in his studio, looking over his shoulder (literally sometimes) and learning from following a professional. He talks out loud what goes on in his thoughts as he mindfully works his image. Seeing him work really helps me. His own career is used as an example, and I love all the personal stories that talk about his journey in the art world and specifically in this field of drawing portraits. The course is full of gold nuggets of info, stories, metaphors that help me put words and structure in my work. (I love the \u0022Valley of the Suck\u0022\u003Cstrong\u003E \u003C/strong\u003Econcept\u2013so true! ) This course really helped me to clarify my work in regards to values. Also, it helps to come back to those foundations of the underlying structure of the face. I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to build a strong foundation and seriously wants to get into portrait art. As it is in my case, I would recommend it as well to any professional that wants to come back and touch those foundations again, one tends to forget stuff!

However, MySQL and PHP are often swapped for alternative software solutions such as MariaDB, and Python. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe course starts with a detailed overview on setting up and configuring an instance remotely using terminal and terminal emulators such as PuTTY. Here, students learn the foundations of Linux and various Linux distributions such as Ubuntu to securely power web servers. Students will learn various Linux maintenance and directory commands, coupled with user account configuration and disabling root user access. From there, we dive into the foundations of database management systems and explore the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases. We also explore the two main database transaction standards, including ACID and CAP theorem. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOnce students have a solid understand on the foundations of cloud computing, we demonstrate how to securely install and configure LAMP Stack on Ubuntu.

React, also known as React JS, is a powerful JavaScript library used for building custom, interactive user interfaces using UI components. Some of the most well known examples of organizations using React for their front-end include Netflix, Facebook, and Airbnb. Developed and maintained by Meta along with a community of independent developers, React remains free and open-source. React is a component based library built entirely on JavaScript, which makes it perfect for designing complex UI\u2019s. With React, developers can build encapsulated components that efficiently manage their own state and render UI updates specifically when data changes. For example, think of the automated content refresh feature you see on a twitter feed, or facebook like button. Here the state of the UI component changes on the page, without having to manually refresh when the data is updated. This is just one small, yet powerful feature of React.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThrough a complete hands-on project, this course will teach you all the fundamental principles of React that you must know to become a proficient React developer. We start right from the basics, including the tools needed to get started. From there we dive into JSX, functional components, props, callbacks, and various OnClick events. By this stage, the calculator will have a complete visual display, coupled with functional arithmetic operations. Students then move on to passing parameters in Callback functions, using the React State Hook, and debugging.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn addition to the hands-on React module, we also offer a comprehensive overview of JavaScript for those who need a refresher. Here we start with introducing students to the document object model (DOM) which defines the logical structure of HTML documents. From there we dive into JavaScript to demonstrate various methods in which DOM elements can be manipulated to add interactivity to static components. We start right from the basics, which includes JavaScript placement, and data output. From there we move on to variable declaration, arithmetic operations, operator precedence, data types, and objects. Once the foundations are covered, we move on to more complex operations using Arrays, Conditional Statements, JavaScript comparison operators, booleans and loops. Here students will learn to unleash the true power of JavaScript to render different outcomes based on user interaction. We will explore the use of functions to efficiently handle repetitive tasks and JavaScript events to handle output based on actions and occurrences. The section will conclude with a hands-on project where students will implement their knowledge to build a web based photo gallery and background color changer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/build-a-custom-e-commerce-site-in-react-javascript-basics/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4789922_401f.jpg","duration":"7 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"26,769.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Students interested in learning the Foundations of JavaScript","Students interested in learning the Foundations of ReactJS Library","Students interested in Building Interactive UI Components using React","Students interested in learning how to build a fully customized E-Commerce Site in React"],"tags":["JavaScript","React JS"],"rating":{"count":93,"averageValue":"4.2"},"instructors":[{"name":"YouAccel Training","url":"/user/youaccel/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.2386365}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"YOUACCEL10346","originalPrice":"\u20B91,999","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"3 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/powerpoint-microsoft-powerpoint-for-beginners/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4946324,"title":"PowerPoint - Microsoft PowerPoint For Beginners 2023","shortDescription":"Microsoft PowerPoint presentation that are easy to apply at your work.

We\u2019ve only recently started creating devices which benefit from such a language, so in the mid-1990s, they were way ahead of their time. But that goal drove a lot of the architecture of Java. One of its major selling points was \u201Cwrite once, run anywhere,\u201D so in other words you could write one piece of code, then it could be compiled to run on any device.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIronically, Java did not gain popularity for that reason; instead its creators were able to take advantage of something else that came out in the mid-1990s: the world wide web.

Special focus will be put on understanding the most relevant concepts related to these fundamental topics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn part 2, the \u003Cstrong\u003EFourier series\u003C/strong\u003E and the \u003Cstrong\u003EFourier Transform\u003C/strong\u003E are introduced. Although the most important mathematical formulae are shown, the focus is not on the mathematics. One of the key points of this part is to show one possible application of the Fourier Transform: the \u003Cstrong\u003Espectral derivative\u003C/strong\u003E. Then, we introduce the concept of Wavelets more in detail by showing some applications of \u003Cstrong\u003EMultiresolution Analysis\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is exemplified with \u003Cstrong\u003EMatlab\u003C/strong\u003E, without using rigorous mathematical formulae. The student can follow and get the intuition even if they have no access to Matlab.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother important achievement of this part is to convey a simple but thorough explanation of the well-known computational \u003Cstrong\u003EFFT\u003C/strong\u003E method.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are also some extras on the Inverse \u003Cstrong\u003EWavelet Transform\u003C/strong\u003E and the Uncertainty principle (here we see more mathematics, but this is an extra, if you want to skip it, just do it).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn part 3, some machine learning techniques are introduced: the methods of \u003Cstrong\u003Ecurve-fitting\u003C/strong\u003E, \u003Cstrong\u003Egradient descent\u003C/strong\u003E, \u003Cstrong\u003Elinear regression, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), feature extraction,\u003C/strong\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003Eclassification\u003C/strong\u003E, \u003Cstrong\u003EGaussian Mixture Model (GMM)\u003C/strong\u003E. The objective in this part is to show some practical applications and cast light on their usefulness.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe will also focus on \u003Cstrong\u003Esparsity\u003C/strong\u003E and \u003Cstrong\u003Ecompressed sensing\u003C/strong\u003E, which are related concepts in signal processing. Sparsity means that a signal can be represented by a few non-zero coefficients in some domain, such as frequency or wavelet. Compressed sensing means that a signal can be reconstructed from fewer measurements than the Nyquist\u2013Shannon sampling theorem requires, by exploiting its sparsity and using optimization techniques. These concepts are useful for reducing the dimensionality and complexity of data in machine learning applications, such as image processing or radar imaging.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPart 4 is a self-contained introduction to \u003Cstrong\u003Edynamical models\u003C/strong\u003E. The models contained in this part are the prey-predator model, the model of epidemics, the logistic model of population growth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe student will learn how to implement these models using free and open-source software called \u003Cstrong\u003EScilab\u003C/strong\u003E (quite similar to Matlab).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERelated to Part 4, there is an application of machine learning technique called \u003Cstrong\u003ESINDy, \u003C/strong\u003Ewhich is an acronym for \u003Cstrong\u003ESparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics\u003C/strong\u003E. It is a machine learning algorithm that can discover the governing equations of a dynamical system from time series data. The main idea is to assume that the system can be described by a sparse set of nonlinear functions, and then use a sparsity-promoting regression technique to find the coefficients of these functions that best fit the data. This way, SINDy can recover interpretable and parsimonious models of complex systems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote: For some of the lectures of the course, I was inspired by \u003Cstrong\u003ES.L.

It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E*\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E javascript course contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript introduction\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript array\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript variables\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript functions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript objects\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript control statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript cookies\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript loop statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript data structures\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript error handling\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript regular expressions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003Esection 3- learn PHP\u0026nbsp;programming language\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this section, we will learn the basic structure of a web application, and how a web browser interacts with a web server.

This course teaches students how to create modern, interactive web pages using the Bootstrap framework and React JavaScript library. The course starts with an introduction into Bootstrap with a focus on its reputation in the development community as the number one choice for mobile-first front-end web frameworks. Bootstrap is a well documented collection of reusable code written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We start with exploring the foundations of Bootstrap, including embedding it into projects, and building out the basic Bootstrap page structure. From there we catapult into the infamous Bootstrap grid system, along with the commonly used three column web page layout. After the introductory topics, students learn to work with a number of components from typography, tables and image styling right up to wells, alerts, and buttons. As part of the course we demonstrate how to build out intricate navigation menus using dropdown, collapse, accordion, and pill menus. We will also cover form styling, carousels, modals, scrollspy and just about every other Bootstrap component that\u2019s instrumental to your journey as a front-end developer. The module concludes with a hands-on project, where students will use a Bootstrap theme to build a stunning web page from scratch.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn the second section of the course, we explore React. React, also known as React JS, is a powerful JavaScript library used for building custom, interactive user interfaces using UI components. Similar to Bootstrap, React is a well documented free and open source library. The project was founded by Meta and a network of independent developers. In this section, students learn how to use the React library through a series of hands-on projects. The React section of this course starts off with a hands-on project where you\u2019ll learn how to work with functional React components, props, Callback functions, OnClick Events, and the React State hook to build a fully functional calculator. From there we will dive into project number two, where you will build a connect-4 clone. Here we will cover more intermediate concepts including passing props, destructuring, passing arguments to click events, various styling methods, and handling callbacks. You will also learn about the React key property, React lifecycle events, and conditional rendering. By the end you will have built a complete multi and single player connect-4 game board with built-in AI capabilities. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn the final section of the course we further unleash the power of React by building out a complete e-commerce site with multiple product categories, a product showcase, shopping cart feature, and much more. Here, we introduce a number of integral new concepts including: JSON server, Fetch API, and installing React router. These essential building blocks will be used to render the product categories, style the product list, and configure the product details page. From there we dive into styled components, refactoring the shop layout, and exploring the concept of \u201Ccontext\u201D in React. In the final stages of the project students will configure the shopping cart basket, and the checkout feature. We will also implement a product search feature, followed by in-depth exercises on validating input forms in React.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAs you can see this course covers a tremendous bit of ground. Best of all it features Tim Maclachlan - a renowned senior full-stack developer with over 20 years of commercial development experience.

Natural selection happens when the pressures combine, causing populations of species to evolve. The study of ecology looks at these forces, their sources, and the complex relationships between organisms, and between organisms and their surroundings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEcosystems, a term often used in biology, are communities of plants and animals living in close proximity to one another and their non-living environments.

in business etiquette : It\u0027s imperative to build rapport and a strong foundation in business with business etiquette. The more polite you are, the more likely people will be to work with you and enhance your friendships. When you have respect and trust between people, communication remains effective even if a person doesn\u0027t understand a particular language. When you practice business etiquette, you\u0027re more likely to actively listen, give constructive feedback, pay attention to what someone says, smile, make eye contact with them, talk clearly and avoid words or language that could get misunderstood, and other appropriate things to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s more to business etiquette than just speaking. Additionally, it includes non-verbal cues and an overall demeanor. A diverse workforce means dressing and looking in a way that doesn\u0027t offend or upset others. Dressing and acting professionally is part of business etiquette, and taking cues from others is part of it too. Business etiquette also requires respect for other people\u0027s space and time. Be punctual for meetings, arrive at the workplace on time, and conduct your business in a way that won\u0027t inconvenience anyone. Take cues from others you work with so your behavior aligns with their needs and expectations.
