To run a business at optimal capacity, you need to reduce or eliminate waste from processes and improve production flow.

You\u0027ll explore the concept of continuous flow, and discover how to balance work processes to make production flow more efficient.

And in any business, one of the heaviest drains on profitability is waste. Lean waste can come in the form of time, material, and labor. But it may also be related to the utilization of skill-sets as well as poor planning. In lean manufacturing, waste is any expense or effort that is expended but which does not transform raw materials into an item the customer is willing to pay for. By optimizing process steps and eliminating waste, the only true value is added at each phase of production.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday, the Lean Manufacturing model recognizes 8 types of waste within an operation; seven originally conceived when the Toyota Production System was first conceived, and an eighth added when the lean methodology was adopted within the Western World.

A successful manager is now expected to act as a leader, a mentor, and a coach, guiding their team members towards individual and collective success. This paradigm shift highlights the significance of coaching techniques in the realm of managerial responsibilities.  This article delves into the importance of utilizing coaching techniques in the workplace, particularly within the role of a manager or leader. We will explore how coaching knowledge is pivotal for career development, the responsibilities of middle and top managers in preparing and mentoring personal development plans for team members, and the critical role of coaching in internal education and employee development. Additionally, we will examine how coaching methods contribute to the mental health and well-being of employees, acting as a vital support system for individuals who may have limited access to other sources of guidance.","The Transformation of Managerial Roles  1.1 Evolving Leadership Expectations  The traditional image of a manager as a stern authority figure has given way to a more holistic view of leadership. Managers are now expected to serve as role models, motivators, and mentors to their teams. This shift stems from the recognition that employees perform at their best when they feel valued, supported, and empowered.  The evolution of leadership expectations can be traced back to the changing dynamics of the modern workplace. In the past, managers were primarily responsible for enforcing rules and ensuring productivity. However, as organizations began to realize that employee engagement and satisfaction were crucial for success, a transformation in managerial roles ensued.  Today, managers are not just tasked with overseeing tasks and projects; they are expected to inspire and empower their teams. This shift is partly a response to the changing nature of work itself. In a knowledge-based economy, where creativity, innovation, and adaptability are paramount, traditional top-down management no longer suffices.","1.2 Coaching as a Leadership Skill  Coaching has emerged as a pivotal leadership skill that fosters personal and professional growth.

Coaching is not a one-size-fits-all approach; it is a dynamic and personalized method of leadership. Effective coaches adapt their style to the needs and preferences of individual team members. They actively listen to understand the unique challenges and aspirations of each employee, fostering a sense of trust and rapport.  Moreover, coaching is not merely about providing solutions but guiding employees to discover answers themselves. This approach instills a sense of ownership and accountability in team members. It encourages them to take the initiative, think critically, and develop problem-solving skills\u2014a valuable asset in today\u0027s fast-paced, ever-changing business landscape.

Coaching knowledge equips managers with the ability to provide guidance that is not only aligned with the organization\u0027s needs but also tailored to the aspirations of individual employees.

Because the skill you are learning is speaking related, it only makes sense that you learn through speaking.\u0026nbsp; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp; \tThe skill you will learn in this class is not primarily theoretical or academic. It is a skill that requires physical habits. That is why you will be asked to take part in numerous exercises where you record yourself speaking on video or audio, and then watching or listening to yourself. Learning presentation skills is like learning how to ride a bicycle. You simply have to do it numerous times and work past the wobbling and falling off parts until you get it right.\u0026nbsp; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp; \tThis course contains numerous video lectures plus several bonus books for your training library.\u0026nbsp; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp; \tTJ Walker has been coaching and training people on their presentation skills for 30 years. Now, through the power of Udemy\u0027s online platform, he is able to give you the same high-quality training that he gives in person to CEOs, Fortune 500 executives, and Presidents of countries. Only you can now receive the training at a tiny fraction of the normal fee for in-person training.\u0026nbsp; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp; \tHow long this \u003Cstrong\u003Evoice training course\u003C/strong\u003E takes is up to you. The longest part of the course involves you speaking on video or audio, critiquing yourself, and doing it over until you like it. But if you get to the point where you love how you look and sound when you present it will be well worth the time spent. And having this skill will save you time for all future presentations in your life.\u0026nbsp; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp; \tYou can begin improving your presentation skills right now. You may have an opportunity to speak out as soon as tomorrow, so why waste another day worried that your presentation skills or your voice are not up to high standards.

Build an E-Commerce Site, Calculator, and Connect4 Game.","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the Complete React Certification course. This course offers a comprehensive guide into one of the most powerful, modern JavaScript libraries available - ReactJS. Whether you are completely new to React, or you\u2019ve dabbled with it in the past, one thing\u2019s for sure - You\u2019ve likely interacted with a number of web applications that use the React library for building out user interface components. Some of the most well known examples include Netflix, Facebook, and Airbnb. Developed and maintained by Meta along with a community of independent developers, React remains free and open-source. React is a component based library built entirely on JavaScript, which makes it perfect for designing complex UI\u2019s. With React, developers can build encapsulated components that efficiently manage their own state and render UI updates specifically when data changes. For example, think of the automated content refresh feature you see on a twitter feed, or Facebook like button. Here, the state of the UI component changes on the page without having to manually refresh when the data is updated. This is just one small, yet powerful UI feature built into React.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThis course starts with exploring the foundations of React and its core use cases. We offer a concise definition of what React is and what it\u2019s not. From there, we explore the tools needed to get started along with an introduction into JSX, and Functional React components. Through a complete hands-on project you will learn a number of important concepts including react props, callbacks, OnClick Events and passing parameters within callback functions. By the end of module one you will have built a fully functional calculator, complete with display and numerical operators. We will also cover important topics such as the React State Hook, and Debugging.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn the second module students build out a multiplayer Connect-4 clone, with AI integration. Here we start with styling the individual game board components followed by advanced onClickEvents. This includes global, dynamic and inline styling. From there, we move on to passing props, destructing, and React children. Students will explore the React key property, along with Lifecycle events, game initialization, CSS variables, and conditional rendering. By the end, you will have built a complete Connect-4 game capable of automatically determining the winner in both a multi-player and AI based single player setting.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn module three we further unleash the power of React by building out a complete e-commerce site with multiple product categories, a product showcase, shopping cart feature, and much more. Here, we introduce a number of integral new concepts including: JSON server, Fetch API, and installing React router. These essential building blocks will be used to render the product categories, style the product list, and configure the product details page. From there we dive into styled components, refactoring the shop layout, and exploring the concept of \u201Ccontext\u201D in React. In the final stages of the project students will configure the shopping cart basket, and the integrated checkout feature. We will also implement a product search feature, followed by in-depth exercises on validating input forms in React.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAs you can see this course covers a tremendous bit of ground.
