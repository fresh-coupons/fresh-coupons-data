At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are practicals of:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E* Javascript Course Contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Array\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Variables\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Functions\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Objects\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Control Statements\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Cookies\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Loop statements\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESee you inside the course\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-practicals-crash-course/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4200228_c917_2.jpg","duration":"38 total mins","enrolledStudentsCount":"130,730.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["For Javascript  Programming Beginners","For People New to Javascript","For People Who want to learn Javascript Fundamentals and later Transition into Web Development"],"tags":["JavaScript"],"rating":{"count":1859,"averageValue":"4.1"},"instructors":[{"name":"PROPER DOT INSTITUTE","url":"/user/vivek-dahibhate-2/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.0731707}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"7B5C6CC7EDE0C5FF2CAE","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/professional-diploma-of-real-estate-business-expert/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5871066,"title":"Professional Diploma of Real Estate Business Expert","shortDescription":"Professional Diploma of Real Estate Business Expert by MTF Institute","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWelcome to course\u003C/strong\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003EProfessional Diploma of Real Estate Business Expert by MTF Institute\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECourse provided by \u003Cstrong\u003EMTF Institute of Management, Technology and Finance\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMTF\u003C/strong\u003E is the global educational and research institute with HQ at Lisbon, Portugal, focused on business \u0026amp;
