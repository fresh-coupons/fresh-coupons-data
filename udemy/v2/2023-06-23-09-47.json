It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat is the Linear regression technique of Machine learning?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELinear Regression is a simple machine learning model for regression problems, i.e., when the target variable is a real value.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELinear regression is a linear model, e.g. a model that assumes a linear relationship between the input variables (x) and the single output variable (y). More specifically, that y can be calculated from a linear combination of the input variables (x).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen there is a single input variable (x), the method is referred to as simple linear regression.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen there are multiple input variables, the method is known as multiple linear regression.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy learn Linear regression technique of Machine learning?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are four reasons to learn Linear regression technique of Machine learning:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Linear Regression is the most popular machine learning technique\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Linear Regression has fairly good prediction accuracy\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Linear Regression is simple to implement and easy to interpret\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. It gives you a firm base to start learning other advanced techniques of Machine Learning\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHow much time does it take to learn Linear regression technique of machine learning?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELinear Regression is easy but no one can determine the learning time it takes. It totally depends on you. The method we adopted to help you learn Linear regression starts from the basics and takes you to advanced level within hours. You can follow the same, but remember you can learn nothing without practicing it. Practice is the only way to remember whatever you have learnt. Therefore, we have also provided you with another data set to work on as a separate project of Linear regression.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy use Python for data Machine Learning?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnderstanding Python is one of the valuable skills needed for a career in Machine Learning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough it hasn\u2019t always been, Python is the programming language of choice for data science.

And in any business, one of the heaviest drains on profitability is waste. Lean waste can come in the form of time, material, and labor. But it may also be related to the utilization of skill-sets as well as poor planning. In lean manufacturing, waste is any expense or effort that is expended but which does not transform raw materials into an item the customer is willing to pay for.

From there, we dive into image file formats where students are introduced to a number of key terms relevant to both photography and image retouching.

From there we will visit the collections panel before exploring a number of view options such as Loupe View and Compare view, for the ultimate in versatility when performing professional image enhancements. Students will learn to copy and paste image adjustments across a number of different images, while exploring a variety of image enhancement tools such as exposure correction, cloning, spot removal, red eye reduction, graduated filters, and white balance correction. In addition to simple adjustments, we also demonstrate how to perform intermediate enhancements using retouching techniques that are used in studios.

This is basically an extensive project based course where you will be fully guided step by step on how to build autonomous vehicle simulation with self driving feature using Python programming language alongside with Python libraries, such as Pygame and NEAT where Pygame will be utilised to create a visual and realistic representation of the simulated environment while NEAT which stands for NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies will be used to train the neural networks to control and design self driving behaviour. The neural network takes input from the car\u0027s sensors. In addition, the neural network will also learn and adapt over time through evolutionary algorithms, improving the car\u0027s driving performance and decision-making skills. In the introduction session, you will be learning the basic fundamentals of autonomous car, getting to know technologies behind it as well as understanding how it works. Then, after learning the basic concepts, you will be guided step by step to set up all necessary tools, for instance Visual Studio Code IDE, installing Python, and other relevant tools. Before getting into the project, there will be a basic python training session where you will learn all important concepts in Python that you need to know and master to prepare you for the upcoming project. The basic Python training session is optional since the session was created and intended only for those who are not very confident with their Python programming skills. In the basic Python training session, you will learn different data types or variables, how to build functions and pass down parameters to the function, how to build class, and basic fundamentals of Pygame. Then, once the basic Python training session has been completed, you will move to the project where you will be fully guided step by step on how to build an autonomous car simulation with advanced self driving features from scratch. Once the project has been built, we are going to be conducting testing, not only to test if the code works but also to test if the output of the code is what we expected to get. There will be three main objectives that will be tested, those are the car\u0027s decision making ability, sensor integration, and collision prevention.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, we need to ask ourselves this question. Why should we learn how to build an autonomous car simulator? It might be very interesting to learn how the self-driving feature in cars like Tesla works, obviously the system is very complicated and a bit difficult to be understood but what if you have a chance to learn the self driving mechanism from a more simple perspective and that\u2019s exactly what you are going to learn in this course. The next follow up question might potentially be, well it is near impossible and definitely unrealistic to create my own real autonomous vehicle like Tesla, it will cost you a lot and even if you have the funding, you might not have the right skill sets and knowledge to begin with. That is actually true to some extent, we are not going to build a brand new car with self -driving features, instead, we can potentially build a very cool self-driving game or maybe build an autonomous object simulator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow are things that we are going to learn from this course:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearning the fundamental concepts of self driving autonomous car, getting to know technologies behind it, as well as its capabilities and limitations\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearning and understanding how autonomous car works\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasic Python training session which prepares you better for the autonomous car project\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBuilding self driving autonomous car simulation project using Pygame and NEAT\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearning how to build and design car track using GIMP painting tool\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETesting the self driving autonomous cars to ensures the car has a good decision making ability, solid sensor integrations, and effective collision prevention system\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/self-driving-simulations-develop-autonomous-car-with-python/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5394906_4f8a.jpg","duration":"4.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"1,476.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["People who are interested to build self driving autonomous car simulation with Python","People who are interested to learn about the basic concepts of autonomous car"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":0,"averageValue":"0.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"Christ Raharja","url":"/user/christ-raharja/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":0}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"0C0D741486D4A4F45AE8","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"3 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/arduino-uno-based-obstacle-avoiding-robot-car-rc-control/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4625508,"title":"Arduino UNO Based Obstacle Avoiding Robot Car \u0026 RC-Control","shortDescription":"Learn To Create Arduino UNO Based Obstacle Avoiding Robot Car \u0026 RC-Control","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EIn this course, you will\u003Cem\u003E Learn To Create\u003C/em\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EArduino UNO Based Obstacle Avoiding Robot Car \u0026amp; RC-Control \u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003EUsing\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E Arduino UNO Microcontroller\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EWhat you will be learning in the course?\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat is \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EArduino UNO Microcontroller?\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasics of \u003Cstrong\u003EArduino \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstalling \u003Cstrong\u003EArduino IDE\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBlinking Built-in LED on Arduino\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBlink LED\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Multiple LED\u0027S Blinking In Series\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUser Input Control LED\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELED Brightness Control\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELED Brightness Control With Potentiometer\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELED Push Button Control\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUltrasonic Sensor Measure Distance\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUltrasonic Distance LED\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMotor Movement in all Directions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EObstacle Avoiding Robot Car\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003ERC-Control Robot Car.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll the above \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EFeatures and List Goes On...\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat is \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EObstacle Avoiding Robot?\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow day\u2019s many industries are using robots due to their high level of performance and reliability and which is a great help for human beings.

Some of its primary targets include reducing arms flows and combatting organized crime, as well as significantly reducing all forms of violence worldwide.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday more than 600 million young people live in volatile and conflict-prone areas. Young people are disproportionately affected by the multiple and often interlinked forms of violence such as political violence, organized crime and terrorist attacks which exact human, social and economic costs. In the past decade, the recruitment of young people into violent and extremist groups has led some to view youth as a threat to global security and stability. However, research shows that the number of young people who actively participate in violence is a small minority, while the vast majority of youth are not prone to violence, despite the injustices, deprivations and abuse they can confront daily, particularly in conflict zones. Moreover, a growing body of evidence suggests that they can and do play active roles as agents of positive and constructive change, and the recently adopted Security Council Resolution 2250 on Youth, Peace and Security highlights this fact. It is a formal recognition of the positive role youth can play in the maintenance of international peace and security.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe maintenance of global peace and security is a cross cutting issue that is critical to achieving all the Sustainable Development Goals.

Thus, such changes, although undesired, are considered normal and are sometimes called \u0022pure aging.\u0022 These changes occur in everyone who lives long enough, and that universality is part of the definition of pure aging. The changes are to be expected and are generally unavoidable. For example, as people age, the lens of the eye thickens, stiffens, and becomes less able to focus on close objects, such as reading materials (a disorder called presbyopia). This change occurs in virtually all older people. Thus, presbyopia is considered normal aging. Other terms used to describe these changes are \u0022usual aging\u0022 and \u0022senescence.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eexactly what constitutes normal aging is not always clear. Changes that occur with normal aging make people more likely to develop certain disorders. However, people can sometimes take actions to compensate for these changes. For example, older people are more likely to lose teeth. But seeing a dentist regularly, eating fewer sweets, and brushing and flossing regularly may reduce the chances of tooth loss. Thus, tooth loss, although common with aging, is an avoidable part of aging.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, functional decline that is part of aging sometimes seems similar to functional decline that is part of a disorder. For example, with advanced age, a mild decline in mental function is nearly universal and is considered normal aging. This decline includes increased difficulty learning new things such as languages, decreased attention span, and increased forgetfulness. In contrast, the decline that occurs in dementia is much more severe. For example, people who are aging normally may misplace things or forget details, but people who have dementia forget entire events. People with dementia also have difficulty doing normal daily tasks (such as driving, cooking, and handling finances) and understanding the environment, including knowing what year it is and where they are. Thus, dementia is considered a disorder, even though it is common later in life. Certain kinds of dementia, such as Alzheimer disease, differ from normal aging in other ways as well. For example, brain tissue (obtained during autopsy) in people with Alzheimer disease looks different from that in older people without the disease. So the distinction between normal aging and dementia is clear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESometimes the distinction between functional decline that is part of aging and functional decline that is part of a disorder seems arbitrary. For example, as people age, blood sugar levels increase more after eating carbohydrates than they do in younger people. This increase is considered normal aging. However, if the increase exceeds a certain level, diabetes, a disorder, is diagnosed. In this case, the difference is one of degree only.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHealthy (successful) aging\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHealthy aging refers to postponement of or reduction in the undesired effects of aging. The goals of healthy aging are maintaining physical and mental health, avoiding disorders, and remaining active and independent. For most people, maintaining general good health requires more effort as they age. Developing certain healthy habits can help, such as\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFollowing a nutritious diet\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAvoiding cigarette smoking and excessive alcohol use\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExercising regularly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStaying mentally active\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe sooner a person develops these habits, the better. However, it is never too late to begin. In this way, people can have some control over what happens to them as they age.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome evidence suggests that in the United States, healthy aging is on the rise:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA decrease in the percentage of people aged 75 to 84 who report impairments\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA decrease in the percentage of people over age 65 with debilitating disorders\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn increase in the oldest old\u2014people age 85 and older, including those who have reached 100 (centenarians)\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAging is a natural process of structural decay that all living organisms undergo. It is caused by intrinsic processes (e.g., genomic instability and telomeric attrition) and interactions with the environment (e.g., exposure to sunlight and toxins). As aging is related to and dependent upon living and interacting with the environment, it has been associated with chronology since antiquity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eas human beings get older, the aging process results in many organic changes that must be anticipated and differentiated by the physician from the actual manifestations of a disease. For example, deposition of materials in the arterioles over the years can slightly increase systemic vascular resistance and ultimately blood pressure. On the other hand, the processes related to aging can play a major role in the pathophysiology of degenerative conditions such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Huntington\u2019s disease, and Parkinsonism.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor optimal comprehension, the medical student should be familiarized with organelles and their functions, genome replication, epigenetics, the basics of stem cells, and intercellular communication.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/aging-and-geriatrics/","imageUri":"https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5067800_0e26.jpg","duration":"2 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"1,721.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["any one take care of older people    , Nurses ,Pharmacists , physician ,old people seeking advice"],"tags":["Psychology"],"rating":{"count":4,"averageValue":"4.4"},"instructors":[{"name":"Mohamed AL ashram","url":"/user/mohamed-taha-288/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.25}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"140F4DB18DBA9790DA6E","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code-data-scientist-challenge/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4756496,"title":"100 Days of Code: Data Scientist Challenge 2023","shortDescription":"Embark on a Data Scientist Journey with the 100 Days of Code Challenge - Master Data Analysis and Machine Learning!","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0022100 Days of Code: Data Scientist Challenge\u0022 course is an intensive, practical-oriented program that aims to transform learners into proficient data scientists within 100 days.

Political sociology deals with the relationship between state and society on the basis of mutual interaction and with power as the ultimate aim.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe course is provided both in the form of part-time as well as on correspondence basis. Political sociology is concerned with the sociological analysis of political phenomena ranging from the State and civil society to the family, investigating topics such as citizenship, social movements, and the sources of social power. Traditionally, there were four main areas of research.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. The sociopolitical formation of the modern state\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. How social inequality between groups (class, race, gender) influences politics\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. How public opinion, ideologies, personalities, social movements, and trends outside of the formal institutions of political power affect formal politics\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Power relationships within and between social groups (e.g. families, workplaces, bureaucracy, media)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPolitical sociology is concerned with the sociological analysis of political phenomena ranging from the State and civil society to the family, investigating topics such as citizenship, social movements, and the sources of social power. The lineage of this discipline is typically traced from such thinkers as Montesquieu, Smith and Ferguson through the founding fathers of sociology \u2013 Karl Marx, Emile Durkheim and Max Weber \u2013 to such contemporary theorists as Anthony Giddens, Jurgen Habermas and Michael Mann. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn other words, political sociology was traditionally concerned with how social trends, dynamics, and structures of domination affect formal political processes, as well as exploring how various social forces work together to change political policies. From this perspective, we can identify three major theoretical frameworks: pluralism, elite or managerial theory, and class analysis, which overlaps with Marxist analysis. Pluralism sees politics primarily as a contest among competing interest groups. Elite or managerial theory is sometimes called a state-centered approach. It explains what the state does by looking at constraints from organizational structure, semi-autonomous state managers, and interests that arise from the state as a unique, power-concentrating organization. A leading representative is Theda Skocpol. Social class theory analysis emphasizes the political power of capitalist elites. It can be split into two parts: one is the \u0022power structure\u0022 or \u0022instrumentalist\u0022 approach, whereas another is the structuralist approach. The power structure approach focuses on the question of who rules and its most well-known representative is G.

Unsupervised learning is a category of machine learning where algorithms are applied to unlabelled data to discover patterns, structures, and relationships without prior knowledge or guidance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThroughout the course, students will explore various unsupervised learning algorithms and their applications in uncovering hidden insights from large datasets. The emphasis will be on understanding the principles, methodologies, and practical implementation of these algorithms rather than focusing on mathematical derivations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe course will begin with an introduction to unsupervised learning, covering the basic concepts and goals. Students will learn how unsupervised learning differs from supervised learning and semi-supervised learning, and the advantages and limitations of unsupervised techniques. The importance of pre-processing and data preparation will also be discussed to ensure quality results.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first major topic of the course will be clustering techniques. Students will dive into different clustering algorithms such as hierarchical clustering, k-means clustering, density-based clustering (e.g., DBSCAN), and expectation-maximization (EM) clustering. They will learn how to apply these algorithms to group similar data points together and identify underlying patterns and structures. The challenges and considerations in selecting appropriate clustering methods for different scenarios will be explored.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe course will then move on to dimensionality reduction, which aims to reduce the number of features or variables in a dataset while retaining relevant information. Students will explore techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA), singular value decomposition (SVD), and t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE). They will understand how these methods can be used to visualize high-dimensional data and extract meaningful representations that facilitate analysis and interpretation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssociation rule mining will be another key topic covered in the course. Students will learn about the popular Apriori algorithm and FP-growth algorithm, which are used to discover interesting relationships and associations among items in transactional datasets. They will gain insights into evaluating and interpreting association rules, including support, confidence, and lift measures, and their practical applications in market basket analysis and recommendation systems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe course will also address outlier detection, a critical task in unsupervised learning. Students will explore statistical approaches such as z-score and modified z-score, as well as distance-based approaches like the Local Outlier Factor and Isolation Forest. They will understand how to identify anomalies in data, which can provide valuable insights into potential fraud detection, network intrusion detection, or system failure prediction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEvaluation and validation of unsupervised learning models will be an essential aspect of the course. Students will learn about internal and external evaluation measures, including silhouette coefficient, purity, and Rand index. They will gain skills in assessing the quality of clustering results and measuring the performance of dimensionality reduction techniques.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThroughout the course, students will be exposed to various real-world applications of unsupervised learning. They will discover how market segmentation can be achieved through clustering, enabling businesses to target specific customer segments effectively. They will also explore image and text clustering, which has applications in image recognition, document organization, and recommendation systems. The course will highlight anomaly detection, which plays a crucial role in identifying fraudulent transactions, network intrusions, or manufacturing defects. Lastly, students will learn how unsupervised learning powers recommender systems, providing personalized recommendations based on user behaviour and preferences.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHands-on experience will be a significant component of the course. Students will work on practical exercises and projects, applying unsupervised learning algorithms to real-world datasets using popular data mining tools and programming libraries such as Python\u0027s scikit-learn or R\u0027s caret package. They will gain proficiency in pre-processing data, selecting appropriate algorithms, fine-tuning parameters, and interpreting and visualizing the results.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the end of the course, students will have a solid understanding of unsupervised learning techniques, their practical applications, and the ability to leverage these methods to discover valuable insights and patterns from unlabelled data.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/data-mining-unsupervised-learning/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5369706_acf4_2.jpg","duration":"2 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"1,160.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["IT professionals, including software developers and database administrators, can gain valuable skills by taking a Data Mining course.","Researchers who want to explore and analyze large datasets, discover patterns, and generate insights can benefit from a Data Mining course to learn appropriate methodologies and techniques.","Professionals who want to enhance their skills in data analysis, pattern recognition, and predictive modeling can enroll in a Data Mining course to learn new techniques and stay updated with industry trends.","Students pursuing degrees in these areas can benefit from a Data Mining course to develop skills and knowledge related to analyzing and extracting insights from large datasets."],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":18,"averageValue":"4.9"},"instructors":[{"name":"Elearning Moocs","url":"/user/elearningmoocs/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.875}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":true,"couponData":null}}}
