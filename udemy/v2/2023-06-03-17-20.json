It varies from person to person, but let\u0027s just say you probably won\u0027t master these in your first few months.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdvanced SEO typically involves technical concepts that are somewhat advanced, and/or a deeper understanding of the workings of Google\u0027s algorithm and are often employed by Professional SEOs. Anyone can master advanced concepts with the right strategic guidance and real life application.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAccording to Griffin, Search engine optimization is the science of improving a website to increase its visibility when people search for products or services. The more visibility a website has on search engines, the more likely it is that brand captures business.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWebsite visibility is commonly measured by the placement -- or ranking -- of the site on search engine results pages (SERPs). And companies always vie for the first page, where they are most likely to garner the most attention.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing Google as an example, SERPs often feature ads at the top of the page. These are positions that businesses are willing to pay for to ensure placement on that first page. Following ads are the regular search listings, which marketers and search engines refer to as organic search results. The SEO process aims to increase a business\u0027s organic search results, driving organic search traffic to the site. This enables data marketers to distinguish between traffic that comes to a website from other channels -- such as paid search, social media, referrals and direct -- and the organic search traffic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrganic search traffic is usually higher-quality traffic because users are actively searching for a specific topic, product or service for which a site might rank. If a user finds that site through the search engine, it can lead to better brand engagement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow does SEO work? While there is a way to maximize results, it is almost impossible to fully manipulate search algorithms. Businesses often look to the shortest path toward ideal results with the least amount of effort, but SEO requires a lot of action and time. There is no SEO strategy where something can be changed today with the expectation of clear results tomorrow. SEO is a long-term project, with daily action and constant activity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch engines use bots to crawl all website pages, downloading and storing that information into a collection known as an index. This index is like a library and when someone searches for something in it, the search engine acts as the librarian. The search engine pulls and displays relevant information from the search query and shows users content related to what they were looking for. Search engine algorithms analyze webpages in the index to determine the order those pages should be displayed on the SERP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this master course, you can learn about 5 major topics,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

These concepts are the floor and ceiling of a real number, the absolute value, the density of a subset of \u211D, the supremum, the upper bound, and the greatest element.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second section of this course is about real sequences. It starts with the definition and the different ways to visualize a real sequence. Then it clarifies several concepts related to real sequences: mathematical induction, convergence, divergence, monotonicity, and subsequences. Further, it presents tools and theorems related to real sequences: adjacent sequences, squeeze theorem, fixed point theorem, etc. And finally, it discusses particular sequences you will see a lot during your academic journey: arithmetic and geometric sequences, first- and second-order recursive sequences, and general recursive sequences.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/visual-real-analysis/","imageUri":"https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5169576_de84_5.jpg","duration":"2.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"2,165.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["This course is for college and university students who take math courses dealing with sequences."],"tags":["Math"],"rating":{"count":4,"averageValue":"5.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"Epsilonia Corp.","url":"/user/epsilonia/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":5}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"JUNE2023","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"\u20B9449","expirationText":"5 hours","discountPercentage":44}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/project-management-fundamentals-guide/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5289624,"title":"Project Management Fundamentals: A Beginner\u0027s Guide","shortDescription":"Master the Essentials of Project Management: Learn Planning, Risk Management, and Team Communication","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EProject management is an exciting field to work in.
