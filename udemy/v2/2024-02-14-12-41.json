Se compone en base a etiquetas, tambi\u00E9n llamadas marcas o tags, con las cuales conseguimos expresar las partes de un documento, cabecera, cuerpo, encabezados, p\u00E1rrafos, etc. En definitiva, el contenido de una p\u00E1gina web.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHTML es el primer lenguaje que debe aprender cualquier persona interesada en construir un sitio web. A partir de HTML podemos pasar a muchos otros lenguajes interesantes que sirven para hacer cosas diversas y m\u00E1s avanzadas. Es decir, sea cual sea la tecnolog\u00EDa, herramienta o gestor de contenido que nos hayamos propuesto aprender, o que tengamos que usar en nuestro d\u00EDa a d\u00EDa, HTML siempre ser\u00E1 el lenguaje en el que toda web se construye y, por tanto, es de obligado conocimiento para todos.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECSS son las siglas en ingl\u00E9s de Cascading Style Sheets, que significa \u0022hojas de estilo en cascada\u0022. Es un lenguaje que se usa para estilizar elementos escritos en un lenguaje de marcado como HTML. Este lenguaje fue desarrollado por W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) en 1996 por una raz\u00F3n muy sencilla. HTML no fue dise\u00F1ado para tener etiquetas que ayuden a formatear la p\u00E1gina. Est\u00E1 hecho solo para escribir el marcado para el sitio.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHTML y CSS son dos de los lenguajes de programaci\u00F3n m\u00E1s populares del mundo. Junto con JavaScript (que se utiliza para la funcionalidad), HTML (que se utiliza para la estructura de la p\u00E1gina web), y CSS (que se utiliza para el estilo), se consideran dos de los lenguajes fundamentales para el desarrollo web.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAprender HTML y CSS es sencillo. En pocos d\u00EDas o semanas ser\u00E1s capaz de entender y usar las etiquetas m\u00E1s comunes y componer documentos HTML (p\u00E1ginas web) correctas, y usar los selectores y propiedades m\u00E1s comunes y crear tus propias hojas de estilos con CSS. Aqu\u00ED encontrar\u00E1s muchas ayudas para poder dar esos primeros pasos y luego profundizar en cualquier \u00E1rea que necesites.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELa relaci\u00F3n entre HTML y CSS es muy fuerte. Dado que HTML es un lenguaje de marcado (es decir, constituye la base de un sitio) y CSS enfatiza el estilo (toda la parte est\u00E9tica de un sitio web), van de la mano. CSS no es t\u00E9cnicamente una necesidad, pero no querr\u00E1s tener un sitio que solo tenga HTML, ya que se ver\u00EDa completamente desnudo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEste curso de HTML y CSS te llevar\u00E1 desde principiante hasta profesional.

In this course and in under 9 hours, you are going to learn how to build an amazing e-commerce web app. It\u0027s a pretty decent size project. We are going to get going first by setting up the database and I already prepared the design with bootstrap for us. After this, we are going to display the products neatly and dynamically and we going to build the most challenging part of this project which is the cart. In the cart, there are going to be a lot of details like adding products updating and deleting from the cart, and showing the number of products in it and that\u0027s all going to be done without refreshing the page with Ajax-JQuery of course. And after all of this, we are simply going to process the payment with stripe and we are going to checkout and place orders finally. At the end of this whole process, we are going to give users the products that they paid for. This is the main function of this web app. Surely there is going to be an authentication system, a category system, and more on the users\u0027 side.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThere is also a cool and very practical admin panel, where we are going to handle general functions about our user\u0027s side. So, in the admin panel, we are going to create admins and allow them to log in, create and manage categories, and show them. and we are going to fully handle products. There is a lot more to talk about. There are a lot of details, password hashing, and validations to go ahead and talk about. So, if this looks like something you are interested in, get the course now.
