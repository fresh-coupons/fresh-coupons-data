These networks are typically composed of multiple layers of interconnected \u0022neurons\u0022 or \u0022units\u0022, which are simple mathematical functions that process information. The layers in a deep neural network are organized in a hierarchical manner, with lower layers processing basic features and higher layers combining these features to represent more abstract concepts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDeep learning models are trained using large amounts of data and powerful computational resources, such as graphics processing units (GPUs). Training deep learning models can be computationally intensive, but the models can achieve state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks, including image classification, natural language processing, speech recognition, and many others.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are different types of deep learning models, such as feedforward neural networks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and many more.

It assumes that you\u0027re new to the language, so it gets you started with basic functionality such as creating functions, creating variables, and calling these lines of code from your standard HTML pages. It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are practicals of:\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E* Javascript Course Contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Array\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Variables\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Functions\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Objects\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/css-and-javascript-crash-course/","imageUri":"https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4271184_7325_2.jpg","duration":"1 total hour","enrolledStudentsCount":"87,370.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["For CSS And Beginners","For People Who want to learn CSS Fundamentals and later Transition into Web Designing","For People New to CSS And Javascript"],"tags":["CSS","JavaScript"],"rating":{"count":1047,"averageValue":"4.2"},"instructors":[{"name":"PROPER DOT INSTITUTE","url":"/user/vivek-dahibhate-2/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.105263}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"647A844A42C97553E2FD","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/planning-for-a-web-design-project/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":2437422,"title":"The Website Blueprint - Planning for a web design project","shortDescription":"Learn how to create a web design brief, sitemap and wireframe from a web designer with over 19 years of experience.","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFULLY\u0026nbsp;REVAMPED\u0026nbsp;FOR 2023.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ENearly four years after the creation of this Planning for a Web Design Project course, we are delighted to announce that we are revamping and updating this course ahead of 2023. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Course will be split into three key areas:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Website Blueprint\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis covers all key aspects of preparation required to design a professional website.

To run a business at optimal capacity, you need to reduce or eliminate waste from processes and improve production flow.

And in any business, one of the heaviest drains on profitability is waste. Lean waste can come in the form of time, material, and labor. But it may also be related to the utilization of skill-sets as well as poor planning. In lean manufacturing, waste is any expense or effort that is expended but which does not transform raw materials into an item the customer is willing to pay for.

The LiveView programming model is mostly declarative: instead of saying \u0022when event ABC happens, change XYZ on the page\u0022, events in LiveView are managed by handlers bound to event id. Once the state changes, LiveView will re-render the relevant parts of its HTML template(calculate diff) and push it to the browser, which updates itself most efficiently. This means developers write LiveView templates as any other server-rendered HTML and LiveView does the hard work of tracking changes and sending the relevant diffs to the browser using websocket communication.

It is implemented through a system called jails, as well as a userland utility plus, depending on the system, a number of other utilities. The functionality was committed into FreeBSD in 1999 by Poul-Henning Kamp after some period of production use by a hosting provider and was first released with FreeBSD 4.0, thus being supported on a number of FreeBSD descendants, including DragonFly BSD, to this day.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe need for the FreeBSD jails came from a small shared-environment hosting provider\u0027s (R\u0026amp;D Associates, Inc.\u0027s owner, Derrick T. Woolworth) desire to establish a clean, clear-cut separation between their own services and those of their customers, mainly for security and ease of administration (jail(8)). Instead of adding a new layer of fine-grained configuration options, the solution adopted by Poul-Henning Kamp was to compartmentalize the system \u2013 both its files and its resources \u2013 in such a way that only the right people are given access to the right compartments.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETopics covered in this course:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u0027Mastering Jails\u0027 course covers most of the Jails setup options available and required for running Jails in real live scenarios.

Indeed, you will at first learn all the basics of mathematics especially linear algebra. Once again, you will not become a specialist in this field but you will at least understand the basic concepts of it that can be useful for your understanding of quantum computing. Then, you will learn what exactly is an algorithm and what is the difference between a quantum algorithm and a classical mathematical algorithm. Also, we are going to cover different quantum algorithms that are also really popular in this field. Finally, you will have an introduction to Microsoft Q. In my opinion this is pretty important to learn because this is the programming language that is used to perform different quantum calculations as well as testing or running different quantum apps. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, it\u0027s really important to understand that I created this course on the Principe of learning by practice.

To do this, we will cover:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- What is CI (its purpose, benefits and key methodologies)?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- What are the main indicators that a CI\u0026nbsp;Initiative is needed? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- What are the main tools to deploy when building out a CI\u0026nbsp;Initiative?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Exploring the importance of teams, communication and the toolkit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Introducing key methodologies and concepts such as Lean \u0026amp;\u0026nbsp;Six Sigma.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Understanding how to deliver CI in the right way, an effective way that will garner the highest impact.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EContinuous Improvement has the power to deliver big savings, big reductions in waste and improvements to quality, customer and employee satisfaction. Deliver the CI mind set right, and the rest will do the work for you. And focus on that phrase mind set! As much as CI is made up of a process, a toolkit and several methodologies (such as Lean Six Sigma) it will only be truly successful if the mindset of those embarking on CI\u0026nbsp;is right.\u0026nbsp; By taking this course and delivering on the learnings, you will see the power of CI for you, your fellow colleagues and the wider organisation. \u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/continuous-improvement-an-introduction/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/3764678_7237_5.jpg","duration":"8.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"6,473.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Anyone currently working for a company who wants to improve the business","Anyone who owns a business / manages a department and wants to improve operational performance","Anyone who wants to upskill in this field as improving your business from within is a skill HIGHLY in demand","Anyone who wants to leave the course with full confidence of how to continually improve their business"],"tags":["Kaizen"],"rating":{"count":140,"averageValue":"4.7"},"instructors":[{"name":"Robert Chapman","url":"/user/robert-chapman-23/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.5454545}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"SEPTEMBERSELLERS","originalPrice":"\u20B92,499","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"2 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/life-coach-training/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":44897,"title":"How to Become a Life Coach - Is Training Needed?","shortDescription":"Life coach education requirements.
