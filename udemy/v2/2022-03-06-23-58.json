It produces the power that turns the wheels and electricity for lights and other systems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost automobiles are powered by an internal combustion engine. Fuel, usually gasoline or petrol, is burned with air to create gases that expand. A spark plug creates a spark that ignites the gas and makes it burn. This energy moves through cylinders in which pistons slide up and down. They are attached to rods that move a crankshaft. Normal car engines have four to six cylinders but there are also models with eight and sixteen cylinders. The turning movement is passed through the drivetrain to the drive wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe engine and all parts that carry power to the wheels are called the drivetrain. It includes the transmission, drive shaft, differential, the axles and the drive wheels that move the car. While most cars have drive wheels in the front, some have them in the back. Cars that need to drive over all kinds of ground have a four-wheel drive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe transmission controls the speed and torque. When a car travels at a normal speed on a flat road it does not need so much torque to keep it moving, but when you want to start a car from a hill the engine must produce more power. Gears control speed and power of the engine in different driving conditions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn cars with manual transmission you have to change gears by pressing down the clutch with your foot and moving a lever. Cars with automatic transmission change gears without control by the driver. Lower gears give the car more torque and speed. When the car moves faster the transmission shifts to higher gears.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe driveshaft carries the power to the axle which is connected to the wheels. It has several joints which make the axle and wheels moveable as the car drives on uneven and bumpy roads.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe differential is connected to the rear end of the driveshaft. It lets the wheels turn at different speeds because in curves the outer wheels must travel a greater distance than the inner ones.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"Ingl\u00EAs","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/car-repair-auto-mechanic-training-masterclass-crtc-2021/","imageUri":"https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4408498_f040_6.jpg?secure=Yj3QPsbxMJbBrcCttmd8lQ%3D%3D%2C1646679679","duration":"5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"9.400 alunos","lastUpdated":"\u00DAltima atualiza\u00E7\u00E3o em 1/2022","targetAudiences":["Beginner car mechanics"],"tags":["Ensino e estudo acad\u00EAmico","Engenharia","Reparo de carros"],"rating":{"count":38,"averageValue":"3.8"},"instructors":[{"name":"OCSALY - Online Computer Science Academy","url":"/user/online-academy-of-computer-science/","totalNumberOfStudents":33350,"totalNumberOfReviews":201,"averageRating":4.059176650857142}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"AUTOMECHANIC99","originalPrice":"11.840\u00A0\u20B9","discountedPrice":"Kostenlos","expirationText":"4 Tage","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-solutions-architect-associate-2022-practice-exams/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4582194,"title":"AWS Solutions Architect Associate [2022] PRACTICE EXAMS","shortDescription":"Be an AWS Solutions Architect!

Traditional methods of marketing such as media advertising and direct mail are no longer as successful as they were once.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne reason for this is that today\u0027s consumers expect marketers to adapt their demographics or preferences to their messages. Artificial Intelligence is starting to go hand in hand with digital marketing. AI transforms digital strategy with the ability to collect data, interpret it, apply it, and then learn from it. The ability to use it to improve digital marketing strategies and valuable customer insights for companies will be the same as it continues to advance. Excellent customer service is the also most important aspect of an effective digital marketing campaign that this too can be automated by Google Duplex kind of tools that are created in the market.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy this secretive course in \u003Cstrong\u003E\u0022Artificial Intelligence in Digital Marketing -\u0026nbsp;Gold Edition\u0022 \u003C/strong\u003E- the best one in the industry?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArtificial intelligence keeps growing and improving and will not slow down for a while. Implementing AI into your digital marketing strategy will help customers experience better and provide your business with the insights it needs to succeed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u2019s more? The ultimate secret of the course is that we will also tell you about a tool that you can use for unlimited lead-generation using another secretive artificial intelligence\u0026nbsp;(AI) technology. There is often a disconnection between sales and marketing departments in many businesses. This is typically due to a lack of interaction or shared attention. Marketers may give sales a lead they believe to be ideal, but sales are not. It creates tension between two teams to work together, and AI is the perfect way to bring them together. AI can point out positive sales leads, which will also satisfy marketing, and ensure that potential customers are targeted at the right platforms. You don\u0027t want the company that sells accounting software to be advertised by someone. All teams will need to come together and agree on an optimal customer profile, a profile that fits marketing and sales, to better use AI in the B2B lead generation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe profile can consist of multiple variables, such as sector, company level, and how many employees they have. The standards are almost infinite. The AI will use the profile to measure current and potential leads against a selection of pre-defined behavioural criteria. Without us providing all this, the AI will fumble around, essentially throwing darts at a board while blindfolded. The AI can predict future patterns for lead generation, possible spending, and what campaigns or services will draw their interest from this.

The term digital forensics was originally used as a synonym for computer forensics but has expanded to cover investigation of all devices capable of storing digital data. With roots in the personal computing revolution of the late 1970s and early 1980s, the discipline evolved in a haphazard manner during the 1990s, and it was not until the early 21st century that national policies emerged.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDigital forensics investigations have a variety of applications. The most common is to support or refute a hypothesis before criminal or civil courts. Criminal cases involve the alleged breaking of laws that are defined by legislation and that are enforced by the police and prosecuted by the state, such as theft and assault against the person. Civil cases on the other hand deal with protecting the rights and property of individuals (often associated with family disputes) but may also be concerned with contractual disputes between commercial entities where a form of digital forensics referred to as electronic discovery (ediscovery) may be involved\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring the 1980s very few specialized digital forensic tools existed, and consequently investigators often performed live analysis on media, examining computers from within the operating system using existing sysadmin tools to extract evidence. This practice carried the risk of modifying data on the disk, either inadvertently or otherwise, which led to claims of evidence tampering. A number of tools were created during the early 1990s to address the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDigital forensics is commonly used in both criminal law and private investigation. Traditionally it has been associated with criminal law, where evidence is collected to support or oppose a hypothesis before the courts. As with other areas of forensics this is often a part of a wider investigation spanning a number of disciplines. In some cases, the collected evidence is used as a form of intelligence gathering, used for other purposes than court proceedings (for example to locate, identify or halt other crimes). As a result, intelligence gathering is sometimes held to a less strict forensic standard.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"Ingl\u00EAs","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/digital-forensics-course/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4372164_7752_2.jpg","duration":"11.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"14.455 alunos","lastUpdated":"\u00DAltima atualiza\u00E7\u00E3o em 1/2022","targetAudiences":["Beginner Digital Forensics Investigators"],"tags":["TI e software","Rede e seguran\u00E7a","Investiga\u00E7\u00E3o forense digital"],"rating":{"count":64,"averageValue":"4.1"},"instructors":[{"name":"OCSALY - Online Computer Science Academy","url":"/user/online-academy-of-computer-science/","totalNumberOfStudents":33350,"totalNumberOfReviews":201,"averageRating":4.059176650857142}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"OCSALY9218","originalPrice":"11.200\u00A0\u20B9","discountedPrice":"7.280\u00A0\u20B9","expirationText":"5 Stunden","discountPercentage":35}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-basics-to-advanced/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":3033186,"title":"JavaScript - Basics to Advanced [step by step (2021)]","shortDescription":"A perfect JavaScript course for all those who want to learn and master JavaScript programming skills right from scratch.","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E*UPDATE:\u0026nbsp; New Content Added\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAround 60\u002B video content added \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\u002B \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBonus Sections: jQuery and ES6 for ReactJS\u003C/strong\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIn this JavaScript course -\u003C/strong\u003E \u003Cbr\u003EAt the beginning of this \u003Cstrong\u003EJavaScript\u003C/strong\u003E course, you will learn and understand :\u0026nbsp; \u003Cbr\u003E1) All the basic concepts of JavaScript. \u003Cbr\u003E2) And the advanced topics like object-oriented programming where you will learn the OOPs concepts like data binding, inheritance, data encapsulation, etc. \u003Cbr\u003E3) The most used part in JavaScript - Functional Programming where we will cover the special functions like map, filter, reduce, and many more. \u003Cbr\u003E4) We will also cover some essential topics in jQuery which is a widely used JavaScript library.

If you\u0027re already gone through PMBOK 6 training or read the book, you can just read the PMBOK once. It\u0027s 1/5 the size of the PMBOK 6 so you can read this book much faster than the PMBOK 6.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ECan I start with this PMBOK 7 online course before taking other courses?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ECompletely.

This course will set the stage for going through the content from the PMBOK 6.

A person would be able to redo and reproduce an origami by unfolding it first. Knowing how cars work requires understanding each major and minor mechanical part and their purposes. The complex nature of the human anatomy requires people to understand each and every part of the body. How? By dissecting it. Reverse engineering is a way for us to understand how things were designed, why is it in its state, when it triggers, how it works, and what its purpose is. In effect, the information is used to redesign and improve for better performance and cost. It can even help fix defects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is amazing, and rather disconcerting, to realize how much software we run without knowing for sure what it does. We buy software off the shelf in shrink wrapped packages. We run setup utilities that install numerous files, change system settings, delete or disable older versions and superseded utilities, and modify critical registry files. Every time we access a Website, we may invoke or interact with dozens of programs and code segments that are necessary to give us the intended look, feel, and behaviour. We purchase CDs with hundreds of games and utilities or download them as shareware. We exchange useful programs with colleagues and friends when we have tried only a fraction of each program\u2019s features. Then, we download updates and install patches, trusting that the vendors are sure that the changes are correct and complete. We blindly hope that the latest change to each program keeps it compatible with all of the rest of the programs on our system. We rely on much software that we do not understand and do not know very well at all. I refer to a lot more than our desktop or laptop personal computers. The concept of ubiquitous computing, or \u201Csoftware everywhere,\u201D is rapidly putting software control and interconnection in devices throughout our environment. The average automobile now has more lines of software code in its engine controls than were required to land the Apollo astronauts on the Moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMalware analysis is the study of malware\u0027s behaviour. The objective of malware analysis is to understand the working of malware and how to detect and eliminate it. It involves analysing the suspect binary in a safe environment to identify its characteristics and functionalities so that better defences can be built to protect an organization\u0027s network.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImagine if the Trojan Horse was thoroughly inspected and torn down before it was allowed to enter the gates of a city. This would probably cause a few dead soldiers outside the gate fighting for the city. The next time the city is sent another Trojan Horse, archers would know where to point their arrows. And no dead soldiers this time. The same is true for malware analysis\u2014by knowing the behaviours of a certain malware through reverse engineering, the analyst can recommend various safeguards for the network.
