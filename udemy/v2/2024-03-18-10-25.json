The most popular example of an \u003Cstrong\u003EeCommerce store \u003C/strong\u003Eis undoubtedly Amazon. This acts just like a high street store and allows you to browse products at your leisure and add them to a shopping cart. The only difference is that you can do all this from the comfort of your home and once you check out, the products are the simply delivered to you wherever you are.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIt\u2019s a familiar concept, but what makes it so important?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy eCommerce is the Future\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E#1 eCommerce is Growing\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/strong\u003EThe first thing you need to recognize is that eCommerce is growing. In the early days, people were uncertain about spending money online and found that it was daunting handing over their card details and trusting in a supplier that they couldn\u2019t meet face to face.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EBut now look at companies like Amazon and eBay. These are household names around the world and everyone from the young and tech savvy to the elderly are now happy to shop with them. These companies have helped many people to put aside any concerns they might have had regarding eCommerce and to trust in buying online.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAnd eCommerce is growing as well doing massive business.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EFor proof, you need look no further than stats from \u2018Cyber Monday\u2019. Cyber Monday is a national holiday of sorts where online retailers are anticipated to lower their prices. It follows Black Friday but these days it tends to do nearly as much business \u2013 and it\u2019s growing rapidly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EFor example, in 2014 Cyber Monday created a total of $2.59 billion sales online. That\u2019s no small number but in 2015 this was increased to $3.19 billion. That\u2019s a huge increase. $2.28 billion of these were on desktop (versus $2.04 billion last year) while $838 million were through mobile devices (versus $548 million).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAcross all devices, Cyber Monday increased by 21%!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ESeeing as Amazon is probably the best known online retailer, how is its growth going? Well, the company sold a total of $107.01 billion worth of products in 2015. The company employees 230,800 and there are 304 million active Amazon customer accounts. The brand is worth $47.73 billion and this is only expected to continue to grow as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe story is the same across the board. People are becoming more and more familiar with eCommerce and high-street stores are struggling. This is undoubtedly the future of selling and it\u2019s easy to see why.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E#2 It\u2019s Convenient\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/strong\u003ESo what is it that has led to such growth in eCommerce? Well, the simple fact of the matter is that online sales benefit everyone. The only reason online sales haven\u2019t already dwarfed physical sales is probably the fact that some people still don\u2019t trust shopping online or aren\u2019t sure how to go about it. Over time this concern will be eroded more and more \u2013 while tools like PayPal will make it easier and safer than ever before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWhen you sell products online, it means that you don\u2019t have to employ staff and you don\u2019t have to rent the same amount of physical space. You\u2019ll need somewhere to store your products (unless you\u2019re drop shipping) but other than that, your only costs will be hosting, shipping and web design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ELower overheads mean more profit for you but they also mean lower prices for customers. Customers now have the ability to order products online conveniently but on top of that, they\u2019ll be getting them for a much lower price.\u003Cbr\u003EThere\u2019s also greater versatility in terms of what you can sell. With an eCommerce store you can sell physical products which will require some up-front investment. But\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThere\u2019s also a lot less up-front cost. If you wanted to set up a high-street store, then you would need to be willing to spend a large amount of money to rent the physical space, to invest in the stock and to manage staff etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EHowever, if you are setting up an online store then all you\u2019re going to need is some inventory to sell (perhaps not if you are going to be selling digital products or acting as an affiliate) and a website. It takes just a few clicks to set up an eCommerce store and that means you can have one up and running in minutes for a negligible cost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E#3 It\u2019s the Best Way to Monetize a Website\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/strong\u003EThe last two examples explain why businesses should launch their own eCommerce stores and why you might consider launching an eCommerce store as your business. But you should also sit up and take notice if you run a blog or website already and you\u2019re just looking for a way to monetize it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWhy? Because it\u2019s actually one of the most effective methods there is of making money from an eCommerce website.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EUntil now, you likely have been relying on one of several methods to make money online. Perhaps you\u2019re making ads from advertising on your website (Google AdSense for example) or maybe you\u2019re making money by selling an affiliate product.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn either of those scenarios, it\u2019s important to recognize that you have placed yourself at the bottom of the \u2018foodchain\u2019. In other words, you\u2019re being paid by those advertisers and\u0026nbsp;product creators in order to send business their way. The fact that they\u2019re happy to continue paying you, means that they\u2019re making more money that that from you. In other words, they\u2019re earning more from your visitors than you are! You\u2019re getting a small share of their profit but they\u2019re taking home the lion\u2019s share. And in fact, you\u2019re essentially doing their work for them!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAnd that\u2019s why you\u2019ll typically earn about 1-50 cents per click on an advert. Meaning in turn that you\u2019re going to need hundreds of thousands of visitors to your site a day to make any reasonable money. Compare this with selling your own products and making $20-50 each time. Of course, it\u2019s much easier to get someone to click on an advert than it is to get them to buy something \u2013 but not as much easier as you think if you have decent products and you\u2019re running your store well. The bottom line? You can make a living from a website with just a few hundred daily visitors instead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIf you have an eCommerce website, then the buck stops with you. Now you\u2019re making the maximum profit from your customers because you\u2019re selling something to them and keeping the difference. What\u2019s more, is that you\u2019re keeping your visitors on your eCommerce website and engaged with your brand. You\u2019re not sending them away, you\u2019re keeping them right where you want them and making a real difference to the way they see you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EFinally, selling eCommerce products is better than selling digital products or affiliate products because it\u2019s something that anyone can appreciate. Only a very specific type of person buys eBooks about making money online. Phone cases and clothes though? That has a much broader appeal!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ETry putting an eCommerce website on your existing website and just see what a difference it makes to your profits.

They are going to be also a couple of generic projects like the full CRUD\u0026nbsp;app and so on. After this, the next project will be the starting of something big because it\u0027s an authentication system where I am going to teach you how to develop a login and a register page, how to hash and de-hash passwords, how to do validation and so much more. After this, we are going to build a comments system and this will be the biggest project in this course. We will begin first by doing a post system and then we will grab comments for every post that we have of course we will use Ajax-JQuery for inserting, deleting, and showing comments. after that, we will integrate a rating system into the previous two projects to make a bigger project. So, I will show how to download a JQuery plugin, how to integrate it and how to use it to do the rating system for every post, and so on. And the rating system is going to be implemented of course using Ajax-JQuery. The upcoming project is going to be also created with Ajax and JQuery and that\u0027s a live search system and we will combine it with our big project.

The goal of computer forensics is to perform a structured investigation and maintain a documented chain of evidence to find out exactly what happened on a computing device and who was responsible for it. Computer forensics -- which is sometimes referred to as computer forensic science essentially is data recovery with legal compliance guidelines to make the information admissible in legal proceedings. The terms digital forensics and cyber forensics are often used as synonyms for computer forensics. Digital forensics starts with the collection of information in a way that maintains its integrity. Investigators then analyze the data or system to determine if it was changed, how it was changed and who made the changes. The use of computer forensics isn\u0027t always tied to a crime. The forensic process is also used as part of data recovery processes to gather data from a crashed server, failed drive, reformatted operating system (OS) or other situation where a system has unexpectedly stopped working.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy is computer forensics important?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the civil and criminal justice system, computer forensics helps ensure the integrity of digital evidence presented in court cases.

In this module, you will learn how to publish your app to the Google Play Store. You will also explore strategies for app monetization, including in-app purchases\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven though Kotlin is a full-fledged functional programming language, it preserves most of the object-oriented nature of Java as an alternative programming style, which is very handy when converting existing Java code. Kotlin has classes with constructors, along with nested, inner, and anonymous inner classes, and it has interfaces like Java 8. Kotlin does \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E have a new keyword. To create a class instance, call the constructor just like a regular function. We saw that in the screenshot above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKotlin has single inheritance from a named superclass, and all Kotlin classes have a default superclass Any, which is \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E the same as the Java base class java.lang.Object. Any contains only three predefined member functions: equals(), hashCode(), and toString().\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKotlin classes have to be marked with the open keyword in order to allow other classes to inherit from them; Java classes are kind of the opposite, as they are inheritable \u003Cem\u003Eunless\u003C/em\u003E marked with the final keyword. To override a superclass method, the method itself must be marked open, and the subclass method must be marked override. This is all of a piece with Kotlin\u2019s philosophy of making things explicit rather than relying on defaults. In this particular case, I can see where Kotlin\u2019s way of explicitly marking base class members as open for inheritance and derived class members as overrides avoids several kinds of common Java errors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, you\u0027ll learn how to create apps and run them on virtual devices through guided exercises. You\u0027ll cover the fundamentals of Android development, from structuring an app to building out the UI with Activities and Fragments and various navigation patterns. Progressing through the chapters and lectures, you\u0027ll delve into Android\u0027s RecyclerView to make the most of displaying lists of data and become comfortable with fetching data from a web service and handling images. You\u0027ll then learn about mapping, location services, and the permissions model before working with notifications and how to persist data. Moving on, you\u0027ll get to grips with testing, covering the full spectrum of the test pyramid. You\u0027ll also learn how AAC (Android Architecture Components) are used to cleanly structure your code and explore various architecture patterns and the benefits of dependency injection. \u003Cem\u003EThe core libraries of RxJava and Coroutines are covered for asynchronous programming\u003C/em\u003E. The focus then returns to the UI, demonstrating how to add motion and transitions when users interact with your apps. Towards the end, you\u0027ll build an interesting app to retrieve and display popular movies from a movie database, and then see how to publish your apps on Google Play. By the end of this course, you\u0027ll have the skills and confidence needed to build fully-fledged Android apps using Kotlin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre you trying to start a career in Android programming, but haven\u0027t found the right way in? Do you have a great idea for an app, but don\u0027t know how to make it a reality? Or maybe you\u0027re just frustrated that to learn Android, you must already know Kotlin. If so, then this course is for you\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen Android first arrived in 2008, it was a bit drab compared to the much more stylish iOS on the Apple iPhone/iPad. But, quite quickly, through a variety of handset offers that struck a chord with practical, price-conscious consumers, as well as those who are fashion-conscious and tech-savvy, Android user numbers exploded. For many, myself included, developing for Android is the most rewarding pastime and business, bar none. Quickly putting together a prototype of an idea, refining it, and then deciding to run with it and wire it up into a fully-fledged app, is such an exciting and rewarding process. Any programming can be fun \u2013 I have been programming all my life \u2013 but creating for Android is somehow extraordinarily rewarding..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKotlin is the most succinct language, and therefore is the least error-prone, \u003Cem\u003Ewhich is great for beginners\u003C/em\u003E. Kotlin is also the most fun language, mainly because the succinctness means you can get results faster and with less code. Google considers Kotlin an official (first-class) Android language. There are some other advantages to Kotlin that make it less error-prone and less likely to make mistakes that cause crashes. We will discover the details of these advantages as we proceed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKotlin is an object-oriented language. This means that it uses the concept of reusable programming objects. If this sounds like technical jargon, another analogy will help. Kotlin enables us and others (like the Android API development team) to write code that can be structured based on real-world things, and here is the important part \u2013 it can be reused.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/kotlin-android-training-android-app-development/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4365954_c92d_6.jpg","duration":"15.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"77,195.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Beginner Kotlin Developers","Android Kotlin Programming Training","Mobile App Development Course"],"tags":["Android Development","Kotlin"],"rating":{"count":403,"averageValue":"4.5"},"instructors":[{"name":"OCSALY Academy | 330.000\u002B Students - Ethical Hacking","url":"/user/online-academy-of-computer-science/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.635135}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"MARCH-SALE-OCSALY","originalPrice":"\u20B91,999","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/google-calendar-virtual-assistant/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":3793168,"title":"Google Calendar :  Virtual Assistant","shortDescription":"Planning your life with Google Calendar Arrange your appointments and help you if you are a virtual assistant","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to Google Calendar: and help you if you are a virtual assistant I\u0027ll be your calendar coach!

Java\u0027s extensive support for this protocol is demonstrated, including \u003Cstrong\u003ENIO\u003C/strong\u003E support, and how UDP can support streaming media. We will also cover in our udemy course Network Scalability, I will explain how, as more demands are placed on a server,\u0026nbsp; systems need to scale to address these demands. Several threading techniques supporting this need are demonstrated, including thread pools, futures, and the \u003Cstrong\u003ENIO\u0027\u003C/strong\u003Es selector. We will also cover in our udemy course Network Security, you\u2019ll learn how applications need to protect against a variety of threats. This is supported in Java using encryption and secure hashing techniques. Symmetric and asymmetric encryption techniques are illustrated. In addition, the use of \u003Cstrong\u003ETLS/SSL\u003C/strong\u003E is demonstrated. We will also cover in our udemy course covers how Java applications may need to exchange information with other applications that are written in different languages. The issues that impact an application\u0027s interoperability are examined, including byte order.

The term digital forensics was originally used as a synonym for \u003Cstrong\u003Ecomputer forensics\u003C/strong\u003E but has expanded to cover investigation of all devices capable of storing digital data. With roots in the personal computing revolution of the late 1970s and early 1980s, the discipline evolved in a haphazard manner during the 1990s, and it was not until the early 21st century that national policies emerged.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDigital forensics investigations have a variety of applications. The most common is to support or refute a hypothesis before criminal or civil courts. Criminal cases involve the alleged breaking of laws that are defined by legislation and that are enforced by the police and prosecuted by the state, such as theft and assault against the person. Civil cases on the other hand deal with protecting the rights and property of individuals (often associated with family disputes) but may also be concerned with contractual disputes between commercial entities where a form of digital forensics referred to as electronic discovery (discovery) may be involved\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring the 1980s very few specialized digital forensic tools existed, and consequently investigators often performed live analysis on media, examining computers from within the operating system using existing sysadmin tools to extract evidence. This practice carried the risk of modifying data on the disk, either inadvertently or otherwise, which led to claims of evidence tampering. A number of tools were created during the early 1990s to address the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDigital forensics is commonly used in both criminal law and private investigation. Traditionally it has been associated with criminal law, where evidence is collected to support or oppose a hypothesis before the courts. As with other areas of forensics this is often a part of a wider investigation spanning a number of disciplines. In some cases, the collected evidence is used as a form of intelligence gathering, used for other purposes than court proceedings (for example to locate, identify or halt other crimes). As a result, intelligence gathering is sometimes held to a less strict forensic standard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you enroll in our Digital Forensics Masterclass | Forensic Science 2023 DFMC, you\u0027ll not only learn about the fundamentals of digital forensics, but so much more!

Digital cameras\u003Cstrong\u003E \u003C/strong\u003Eare built into doorbells; your smartphone tracks your daily movements from work to home and back; and you receive social media updates when you go to the gym, see a show, or visit a new city. Digital technology tracks your phone calls, bank transactions, and medical appointments. What about criminal or unethical behavior if it tracks your mundane daily activities?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat activity is also monitored, and as a\u003Cstrong\u003E \u003C/strong\u003Edigital forensic investigator, you\u0027ll need to understand where digital evidence is stored and how to analyse it. There is almost no criminal activity that does not involve digital evidence, and it is your responsibility as an investigator to gather all available evidence, process it, and present your findings to the authorities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInvestigators who work in the field of digital forensics must have a diverse set of skills and interests. The first question I ask anyone thinking about a career in this field is if they enjoy solving puzzles. You may not have access to any information other than the fact that something happened when investigating a case. So, if someone needs to be shown or told what happened, this field may not be right for them. When a case is brought to an investigator\u0027s attention, the investigator is often given instructions to figure out what the computer or device was used for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother important trait is the ability to deal with frustration, as investigative tools and software do not always work without problems. When it comes to cell phones and small devices, this is a fairly common occurrence. Many students, rather than working through the challenges, stop their investigation in class at the first sign of difficulty. They don\u0027t even try to figure out what\u0027s wrong with the tool by looking at the web or using the help system. To be a successful investigator, one must be persistent and creative \u2013 they must be problem solvers. Digital forensics is a branch of forensic science that collects, analyses, documents, and presents digital evidence related to computer crime for use in a court of law using scientific knowledge.
