This shift stems from the recognition that employees perform at their best when they feel valued, supported, and empowered.  The evolution of leadership expectations can be traced back to the changing dynamics of the modern workplace. In the past, managers were primarily responsible for enforcing rules and ensuring productivity. However, as organizations began to realize that employee engagement and satisfaction were crucial for success, a transformation in managerial roles ensued.  Today, managers are not just tasked with overseeing tasks and projects; they are expected to inspire and empower their teams. This shift is partly a response to the changing nature of work itself. In a knowledge-based economy, where creativity, innovation, and adaptability are paramount, traditional top-down management no longer suffices.","Coaching as a Leadership Skill  Coaching has emerged as a pivotal leadership skill that fosters personal and professional growth. We\u0027ll explore how coaching techniques, such as active listening, constructive feedback, and goal-setting, can empower managers to become effective leaders who inspire and guide their teams towards excellence.  Coaching is not a one-size-fits-all approach; it is a dynamic and personalized method of leadership. Effective coaches adapt their style to the needs and preferences of individual team members. They actively listen to understand the unique challenges and aspirations of each employee, fostering a sense of trust and rapport.  Moreover, coaching is not merely about providing solutions but guiding employees to discover answers themselves. This approach instills a sense of ownership and accountability in team members. It encourages them to take the initiative, think critically, and develop problem-solving skills\u2014a valuable asset in today\u0027s fast-paced, ever-changing business landscape.  Coaching also plays a crucial role in setting and achieving goals. Effective managers use coaching techniques to collaboratively define clear, actionable objectives with their team members. This process not only aligns individual efforts with organizational goals but also empowers employees to track their progress and make necessary adjustments along the way.","Coaching Knowledge for Career Development  Career Development in the Modern Workplace  Career development is a top priority for employees. Discover how coaching knowledge equips managers with the tools to help team members navigate their career paths, set meaningful goals, and continually improve their skills.  Career development has evolved from being a peripheral concern to a central focus in the modern workplace. In an era marked by rapid technological advancements and industry disruptions, employees recognize the importance of continuous learning and skill enhancement to remain relevant and competitive.  This heightened emphasis on career development places managers at the forefront of helping their team members chart their professional journeys. Coaching knowledge equips managers with the ability to provide guidance that is not only aligned with the organization\u0027s needs but also tailored to the aspirations of individual employees.  One of the key advantages of coaching in career development is its ability to facilitate self-awareness. Effective coaches help employees identify their strengths, weaknesses, interests, and values. Armed with this self-knowledge, employees can make informed career decisions that align with their passions and long-term goals.","The Manager as a Career Development Partner  Explore the responsibilities of middle and top managers in preparing and mentoring personal development plans for their team members. Learn how these plans can align with organizational objectives and create a win-win situation for both employees and the company.  Managers who actively engage in career development become indispensable partners in their employees\u0027 professional growth. They play a pivotal role in creating personalized development plans that leverage individual strengths and address areas needing improvement.  These development plans not only benefit the employees but also the organization. By aligning individual development goals with the company\u0027s strategic objectives, managers ensure that every team member\u0027s growth contributes to the overall success of the business.  Furthermore, coaching techniques are instrumental in fostering a growth mindset within teams. Managers can use coaching to encourage employees to embrace challenges, persist in the face of setbacks, and view failures as opportunities for learning and improvement. This mindset shift has a profound impact on team performance and innovation.","Coaching for Internal Education and Employee Development  The Role of Managers in Internal Education  Managers often bear the responsibility of nurturing a culture of learning within their teams and organizations. Explore how coaching methods can be instrumental in identifying and addressing skill gaps, fostering innovation, and supporting ongoing employee development.  Organizations that prioritize learning and development gain a competitive edge. Managers are at the forefront of this initiative, serving as the catalysts for continuous improvement and innovation within their teams.  Coaching methods play a pivotal role in identifying and addressing skill gaps. By regularly assessing the competencies of their team members, managers can tailor training and development programs to bridge these gaps effectively. This proactive approach not only enhances individual skills but also bolsters the organization\u0027s overall capabilities.  Moreover, coaching encourages a culture of innovation. Effective coaches inspire creativity and critical thinking in their teams. They challenge employees to question the status quo, explore new ideas, and experiment with novel approaches. In this way, managers act as innovation champions, driving progress and adaptability.","Coaching as a Tool for Employee Empowerment  Employee empowerment is a cornerstone of effective leadership. Coaching techniques provide managers with the tools to empower their team members by fostering a sense of ownership and autonomy in their roles.  One of the primary ways coaching empowers employees is by promoting self-directed learning. Instead of relying solely on formal training programs, employees learn to identify their development needs and take initiative in seeking resources and opportunities for growth. Managers who coach effectively encourage this proactive approach.  Furthermore, coaching cultivates a growth-oriented mindset among employees. When team members receive regular feedback, both positive and constructive, they become more receptive to continuous improvement. They view challenges as opportunities for growth and development, which ultimately leads to higher levels of engagement and performance.  By creating an environment where continuous learning is celebrated, managers inspire their teams to thrive in an ever-changing business landscape. This culture of learning becomes a strategic advantage for organizations, as it enables them to adapt quickly to new challenges and opportunities.","Coaching for Mental Health and Well-being  The Manager as a Trusted Support System  For many employees, especially those who live alone or lack a strong support network, a manager can become their most trusted confidant. Understand how coaching methods extend beyond professional development to support the mental health and well-being of team members.  The relationship between a manager and their team members extends beyond the confines of the workplace. In some cases, a manager may be the primary source of support for an employee, especially when they are facing personal challenges or seeking guidance related to their mental health and well-being.  Coaching methods are not limited to career development; they encompass the whole spectrum of an employee\u0027s life. Effective managers create an environment where team members feel comfortable discussing personal challenges and seeking guidance when needed. This trust and openness are essential for maintaining employee well-being.  In situations where employees are dealing with stress, anxiety, or other mental health issues, managers with coaching skills can provide valuable support. They can listen empathetically, offer guidance on stress management techniques, and help employees access appropriate resources for professional help when necessary.","Coaching for Life Questions and Personal Challenges  Life is filled with complexities, and employees often grapple with personal challenges that can affect their work performance and overall well-being. Managers who are skilled in coaching can offer valuable guidance during these times of need.  One area where coaching is particularly beneficial is work-life balance. In today\u0027s fast-paced world, employees often struggle to juggle their professional and personal responsibilities. Managers can use coaching techniques to help team members set boundaries, manage their time effectively, and achieve a healthier work-life balance.  Coaching also proves invaluable in navigating interpersonal relationships, both within and outside the workplace. Managers can offer insights into effective communication, conflict resolution, and building positive relationships, which can significantly impact an employee\u0027s overall quality of life.  In times of personal crisis or uncertainty, such as major life transitions or unexpected challenges, employees may turn to their managers for guidance. Managers trained in coaching can provide a supportive and non-judgmental space for employees to explore their feelings, identify potential solutions, and develop action plans to address these challenges.","Coaching techniques have become indispensable in the modern workplace, particularly within the roles of managers and leaders. These skills not only drive career development and internal education but also play a crucial role in supporting the mental health and well-being of employees.  As we navigate an ever-changing professional landscape, organizations that recognize the importance of coaching will not only foster a culture of continuous improvement but also cultivate a loyal and motivated workforce. Managers who embrace coaching as a core aspect of their leadership style will not only elevate their own careers but also become catalysts for the success of their teams and organizations as a whole.  By understanding and implementing coaching techniques effectively, managers can truly transform the workplace into an environment where individuals thrive, careers flourish, and holistic well-being is nurtured."],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":115,"averageValue":"4.5"},"instructors":[{"name":"MTF Institute of Management, Technology and Finance","url":"/user/mtfinstitute/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.56}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"90C7B958817FF24FB3EA","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"2 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/python-development-and-python-programming-fundamentals/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5966548,"title":"Python Development and Python Programming Fundamentals","shortDescription":"Introduction / Junior Level: Python Development and Python Programming Fundamentals course by MTF Institute","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWelcome to course: Python Development and Python Programming Fundamentals by MTF Institute\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECourse for Introduction / Junior Level Developers, for people who want to begin path of learning of python.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProgram provided by \u003Cstrong\u003EMTF Institute of Management, Technology and Finance\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMTF\u003C/strong\u003E is the global educational and research institute with HQ at Lisbon, Portugal, focused on business \u0026amp; professional hybrid (on-campus and online) education at areas: Business \u0026amp; Administration, Science \u0026amp; Technology, Banking \u0026amp; Finance. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMTF R\u0026amp;D \u003C/strong\u003Ecenter focused on research activities at areas: Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Data Science, Big Data, WEB3, Blockchain, Cryptocurrency \u0026amp; Digital Assets, Metaverses, Digital Transformation, Fintech, Electronic Commerce, Internet of Things. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMTF\u003C/strong\u003E is the official partner of: IBM, Intel, Microsoft, member of the Portuguese Chamber of Commerce and Industry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMTF \u003C/strong\u003Eis present in 208 countries and has been chosen by more than 400 000 students.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECourse Author:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EStanis\u0142aw Marek Halkiewicz\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am a seasoned educator specializing in the domains of econometrics, statistics, statistical programming, and mathematics, boasting an extensive track record exceeding three years.

In either case, congratulations on selecting one of the most fast-paced segments of the automotive industry. Working with the electrical systems can be challenging, yet very rewarding; however, it can also be very frustrating at times. For many people, learning electrical systems can be a struggle. It is my hope that I am able to present the course to you in such a manner that you will not only understand electrical systems, but will excel at it. There are many ways the theory of electricity can be explained, and many metaphors can be used. Some compare electricity to a water flow, while others explain it in a purely scientific fashion. Everyone learns differently. I am presenting electrical theory in a manner that I hope will be clear and concise. If you do not fully comprehend a concept, then it is important to discuss it with your instructor.

They would specialize in engines, steering/ suspension, or brakes. Today, there is not a system on the vehicle that is immune to the role of electrical circuits. Engine controls, electronic suspension systems, and anti-lock brakes are common on today\u2019s vehicles. Even electrical systems that were once thought of as being simple have evolved to computer controls. Headlights are now pulse-width modulated using high side drivers and will automatically brighten and dim based on the light intensity of oncoming traffic. Today\u2019s vehicles are equipped with twenty or more computers, laser-guided cruise control, sonar park assist, infrared climate control, fiber optics, and radio frequency transponders and decoders. Simple systems have become more computers reliant. For example, the horn circuit on the 2008 Chrysler 300C involves three separate control modules to function.

The goal of computer forensics is to perform a structured investigation and maintain a documented chain of evidence to find out exactly what happened on a computing device and who was responsible for it. Computer forensics -- which is sometimes referred to as computer forensic science essentially is data recovery with legal compliance guidelines to make the information admissible in legal proceedings. The terms digital forensics and cyber forensics are often used as synonyms for computer forensics. Digital forensics starts with the collection of information in a way that maintains its integrity. Investigators then analyze the data or system to determine if it was changed, how it was changed and who made the changes. The use of computer forensics isn\u0027t always tied to a crime. The forensic process is also used as part of data recovery processes to gather data from a crashed server, failed drive, reformatted operating system (OS) or other situation where a system has unexpectedly stopped working.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy is computer forensics important?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the civil and criminal justice system, computer forensics helps ensure the integrity of digital evidence presented in court cases.

In this module, you will learn how to publish your app to the Google Play Store. You will also explore strategies for app monetization, including in-app purchases\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven though Kotlin is a full-fledged functional programming language, it preserves most of the object-oriented nature of Java as an alternative programming style, which is very handy when converting existing Java code. Kotlin has classes with constructors, along with nested, inner, and anonymous inner classes, and it has interfaces like Java 8. Kotlin does \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E have a new keyword. To create a class instance, call the constructor just like a regular function. We saw that in the screenshot above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKotlin has single inheritance from a named superclass, and all Kotlin classes have a default superclass Any, which is \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E the same as the Java base class java.lang.Object. Any contains only three predefined member functions: equals(), hashCode(), and toString().\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKotlin classes have to be marked with the open keyword in order to allow other classes to inherit from them; Java classes are kind of the opposite, as they are inheritable \u003Cem\u003Eunless\u003C/em\u003E marked with the final keyword. To override a superclass method, the method itself must be marked open, and the subclass method must be marked override. This is all of a piece with Kotlin\u2019s philosophy of making things explicit rather than relying on defaults. In this particular case, I can see where Kotlin\u2019s way of explicitly marking base class members as open for inheritance and derived class members as overrides avoids several kinds of common Java errors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, you\u0027ll learn how to create apps and run them on virtual devices through guided exercises. You\u0027ll cover the fundamentals of Android development, from structuring an app to building out the UI with Activities and Fragments and various navigation patterns. Progressing through the chapters and lectures, you\u0027ll delve into Android\u0027s RecyclerView to make the most of displaying lists of data and become comfortable with fetching data from a web service and handling images. You\u0027ll then learn about mapping, location services, and the permissions model before working with notifications and how to persist data. Moving on, you\u0027ll get to grips with testing, covering the full spectrum of the test pyramid. You\u0027ll also learn how AAC (Android Architecture Components) are used to cleanly structure your code and explore various architecture patterns and the benefits of dependency injection. \u003Cem\u003EThe core libraries of RxJava and Coroutines are covered for asynchronous programming\u003C/em\u003E. The focus then returns to the UI, demonstrating how to add motion and transitions when users interact with your apps. Towards the end, you\u0027ll build an interesting app to retrieve and display popular movies from a movie database, and then see how to publish your apps on Google Play. By the end of this course, you\u0027ll have the skills and confidence needed to build fully-fledged Android apps using Kotlin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre you trying to start a career in Android programming, but haven\u0027t found the right way in? Do you have a great idea for an app, but don\u0027t know how to make it a reality? Or maybe you\u0027re just frustrated that to learn Android, you must already know Kotlin. If so, then this course is for you\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen Android first arrived in 2008, it was a bit drab compared to the much more stylish iOS on the Apple iPhone/iPad. But, quite quickly, through a variety of handset offers that struck a chord with practical, price-conscious consumers, as well as those who are fashion-conscious and tech-savvy, Android user numbers exploded. For many, myself included, developing for Android is the most rewarding pastime and business, bar none. Quickly putting together a prototype of an idea, refining it, and then deciding to run with it and wire it up into a fully-fledged app, is such an exciting and rewarding process. Any programming can be fun \u2013 I have been programming all my life \u2013 but creating for Android is somehow extraordinarily rewarding..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKotlin is the most succinct language, and therefore is the least error-prone, \u003Cem\u003Ewhich is great for beginners\u003C/em\u003E. Kotlin is also the most fun language, mainly because the succinctness means you can get results faster and with less code. Google considers Kotlin an official (first-class) Android language. There are some other advantages to Kotlin that make it less error-prone and less likely to make mistakes that cause crashes. We will discover the details of these advantages as we proceed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKotlin is an object-oriented language. This means that it uses the concept of reusable programming objects. If this sounds like technical jargon, another analogy will help. Kotlin enables us and others (like the Android API development team) to write code that can be structured based on real-world things, and here is the important part \u2013 it can be reused.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/kotlin-android-training-android-app-development/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4365954_c92d_6.jpg","duration":"15.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"113,251.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Beginner Kotlin Developers","Android Kotlin Programming Training","Mobile App Development Course"],"tags":["Android Development","Kotlin"],"rating":{"count":731,"averageValue":"4.3"},"instructors":[{"name":"OCSALY Academy | 500.000\u002B Students","url":"/user/online-academy-of-computer-science/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.345679}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"ANDROID_APP-KOTLIN","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/modeling-rending-interior-office-project-in-revit/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5379914,"title":"Mastering Revit - By Projects","shortDescription":"Follow Complete Step by Step instructions to become from Beginner to Pro Level in Modeling \u0026 Rendering Interior Office","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to Learning \u0026amp; Exploring Civil Engineering Concepts \u0026amp; Softwares Practically. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAutodesk Revit is a building information modelling software tool for architects, landscape architects, structural engineers, mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) engineers, designers and contractors.

It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E*\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E javascript course contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript introduction\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript array\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript variables\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript functions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript objects\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript control statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript cookies\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript loop statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript data structures\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript error handling\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript regular expressions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003Esection 4- learn PHP\u0026nbsp;programming language\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis section will learn the basic structure of a web application and how a web browser interacts with a web server.

The accompanying segment presents an overall rundown of the unique phases of the grown-up law enforcement system, as well as the adolescent equity. The first section of our Criminology and Criminal psychology training presents a general summary of the different stages of the criminal justice system, as well as the justice system.
