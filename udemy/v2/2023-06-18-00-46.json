I have tried to all the aspects of the Solar plants which include Technicals, Financial calculations, Financial modelling, Net Metering, Different types of Installations, Monitoring etc. Some of these aspects are generally missed in the other courses. I understand how difficult it is sometimes to explain the technical aspects, therefore I have tried to take the help of analogies and simple to relate examples and calculations for developing an easier understanding of the complex technicalities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeing working as a Solar Energy consultant and executed approximately 50 projects with an aggregated capacity of 4000 kWp or 4 MWp, I have been able to gain useful experience and insights.

connections for Power Transformer, we rarely delve into these theories due to confusing and complex calculations. This course aims to teach you the fundamentals of power transformer, making these connections understandable for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will start this course by explaining the basics of Delta Wye connected transformer, how line to ground voltage can be related to line to line voltage and the practical examples to connect theory with practical life. This module will help you to understand the complex theory behind the Delta Wye transformer connection as I aim to build your strong concept through phasor diagrams. After this module you will be able to draw Delta Wye connection of transformer. By the end of this part, you will have a strong idea on voltage phasor diagram for delta connected transformer. In this module, different types of phasor diagram are compared with each other. I add on value by explaining how the transformer name is designated and the problems that come up with this designation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you are familiar with the calculation and phasor representation of voltage and current quantities for Delta Wye connected transformer, I will introduce you to Wye Wye transformer connection. In this module, you will learn all the confusing theory of Wye Wye transformer connection from very scratch. This section will teach you how Wye connection is made on windings of transformer, what are different ways to configure Wye connection. To give you a better understanding of Wye Wye transformer connection, I discussed the difference of line and phase current in both windings of transformer. Furthermore, you will learn how voltage and current quantities are calculated in addition with the rules for balanced system, and how balanced sets are created by phasors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly, I will explain Circulating Currents and Voltages for Delta Wye connected transformer. Very simple power system is modelled as an example to calculate current and voltages during a faulted condition. For the practical model, you will learn how to calculate both phase and sequence current and voltages, how to relate sequence network diagram with hand-calculated short circuit currents. Furthermore, you will learn how current flows through the Delta Wye transformer connection. And how the High Voltage side of the system differs from the Low Voltage side.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have been creating high quality video tutorials about Power Systems since 2015 and focus specifically on the fundamentals.

To run a business at optimal capacity, you need to reduce or eliminate waste from processes and improve production flow. In this course, you\u0027ll learn about Lean strategies to reduce waste by determining which operations add value and which don\u0027t. You\u0027ll explore the concept of continuous flow, and discover how to balance work processes to make production flow more efficient. You\u0027ll define what waste is, where it exists, and what causes it. You\u0027ll also examine aspects of Muda, continuous flow, line balancing, value and non-value-add, and practical Lean techniques for improving Operations Management.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat is waste in Lean Manufacturing?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA core principle in lean methodology is the removal of waste within an operation. And in any business, one of the heaviest drains on profitability is waste. Lean waste can come in the form of time, material, and labor. But it may also be related to the utilization of skill-sets as well as poor planning. In lean manufacturing, waste is any expense or effort that is expended but which does not transform raw materials into an item the customer is willing to pay for. By optimizing process steps and eliminating waste, the only true value is added at each phase of production.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday, the Lean Manufacturing model recognizes 8 types of waste within an operation; seven originally conceived when the Toyota Production System was first conceived, and an eighth added when the lean methodology was adopted within the Western World.

It assumes that you\u0027re new to the language, so it gets you started with basic functionality such as creating functions, creating variables, and calling these lines of code from your standard HTML pages. It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the
