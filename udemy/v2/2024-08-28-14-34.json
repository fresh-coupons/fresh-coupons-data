Attending these courses enabled me to find a job in this field. Hans has great teaching skills and a valuable experience that he delivers very well to his students. He could bring us to adopt a strategic way of thinking with multiple perspectives. Besides, Hans is very responsive and always willing to help. I really recommend him.. -Solene Moitry \u0022\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Hans was my professor of \u0022Entrepreneurship and Strategy\u0022 during one semester this year. I have to say that this class was one of the best I ever had. Indeed, the content was very interesting and Hans made it even better. He explained us things with well known examples and very interesting shows. Moreover, he always knew how to make the class lively and dynamic by pushing people to express what they thought. I also really liked the way Hans structured the class throughout the semester and I think that it the best way to learn how to become an entrepreneur! -Arnaud Girard\u201D\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u201CI cannot recommend Hans enough! He was an amazing lecturer during my time at Yonsei University. He taught was able to project his knowledge in such an interesting way, which made the learning experience enjoyable. Prior to this class I had no background knowledge of anything business related. Hence, It is amazing that after his short three week class, I have learnt so much.

A user can easily design, check, and optimize shear, moment, gusset, splice, bracket, and base plate connections.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIdeaStatica\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIdeaStatica \u003C/strong\u003Eis another latest popular software for steel connection design where User can define the configurations, sections and more; totally in FEM environment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESteel AutoDrafter\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESteel AutoDrafter \u003C/strong\u003Eis a tool that extracts drawings and material take off from a structural steel model prepared in \u003Cstrong\u003ESTAAD Pro\u003C/strong\u003E. It produces plans at any level, and sections in any of the orthogonal directions. Once the members have been grouped and the frame completed, the model should be analyzed. Steel Autodrafter requires that the model be successfully run before it can import and be used as drafting model.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote: This is Part-II, continuation of Part-I that deasl with the complete Analysis Design\u0026nbsp; of the same project so better please go through Part-I.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/advance-professional-course-in-steel-commercial-part-ii/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5950448_e870_2.jpg","duration":"2.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"3,949.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Professional Structural Engineers","Professional Civil Engineers","Civil Engineers, Practitioner and Students","Governemnt or Institutional Engineers to Check other\u0027s work"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":20,"averageValue":"4.8"},"instructors":[{"name":"Devendra Man Palikhe","url":"/user/1e357e8d-5b65-4ee7-83ec-d8d186aacc95/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.7}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"9641AD5292E0B0D55161","originalPrice":"\u20B91,799","discountedPrice":"\u20B9399","expirationText":"1 day","discountPercentage":78}}},"freeCourses":{}}
