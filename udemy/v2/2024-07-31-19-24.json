It\u0027s the ability to imagine someone else\u0027s pain, joy, anger in our hearts. In order for interpersonal relationships to work effectively and be satisfying, empathy is key. By making sense of what\u0027s said and not said; what\u0027s done and not done, we can make sense of everything. We\u0027re better at receiving and processing information, and finding solutions with it. Our intrinsic sense of justice is rooted in empathy, which strengthens bonds of trust.
