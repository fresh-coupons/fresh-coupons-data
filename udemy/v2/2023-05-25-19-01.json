The course starts from the foundations, where we explore the Lightroom Classic CC interface, and setting up an image catalog. Here, students will learn to configure a catalog and a number of other application preferences, such as import file handling and metadata. From there, we dive into image file formats where students are introduced to a number of key terms relevant to both photography and image retouching. Students will learn the importance of file formats, color spaces, image resolution, pixel density, and the notorious RAW file. We also explore file handling options, interface preferences, identity plate setup and watermarking with both text and graphics.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOnce students are familiar with accessing the various interface components to perform a multitude of image sorting and organization tasks, we dive into one of the most powerful features of Lightroom: The Develop Module. Here students will start with exploring the Develop module interface along with the preset, and history panel. From there we will visit the collections panel before exploring a number of view options such as Loupe View and Compare view, for the ultimate in versatility when performing professional image enhancements. Students will learn to copy and paste image adjustments across a number of different images, while exploring a variety of image enhancement tools such as exposure correction, cloning, spot removal, red eye reduction, graduated filters, and white balance correction. In addition to simple adjustments, we also demonstrate how to perform intermediate enhancements using retouching techniques that are used in studios.

The term digital forensics was originally used as a synonym for \u003Cstrong\u003Ecomputer forensics\u003C/strong\u003E but has expanded to cover investigation of all devices capable of storing digital data. With roots in the personal computing revolution of the late 1970s and early 1980s, the discipline evolved in a haphazard manner during the 1990s, and it was not until the early 21st century that national policies emerged.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDigital forensics investigations have a variety of applications. The most common is to support or refute a hypothesis before criminal or civil courts. Criminal cases involve the alleged breaking of laws that are defined by legislation and that are enforced by the police and prosecuted by the state, such as theft and assault against the person. Civil cases on the other hand deal with protecting the rights and property of individuals (often associated with family disputes) but may also be concerned with contractual disputes between commercial entities where a form of digital forensics referred to as electronic discovery (discovery) may be involved\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring the 1980s very few specialized digital forensic tools existed, and consequently investigators often performed live analysis on media, examining computers from within the operating system using existing sysadmin tools to extract evidence. This practice carried the risk of modifying data on the disk, either inadvertently or otherwise, which led to claims of evidence tampering. A number of tools were created during the early 1990s to address the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDigital forensics is commonly used in both criminal law and private investigation. Traditionally it has been associated with criminal law, where evidence is collected to support or oppose a hypothesis before the courts. As with other areas of forensics this is often a part of a wider investigation spanning a number of disciplines. In some cases, the collected evidence is used as a form of intelligence gathering, used for other purposes than court proceedings (for example to locate, identify or halt other crimes). As a result, intelligence gathering is sometimes held to a less strict forensic standard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you enroll in our Digital Forensics Masterclass | Forensic Science 2023 DFMC, you\u0027ll not only learn about the fundamentals of digital forensics, but so much more!

With this course you have the opportunity to relive this fond childhood memory by building a connect-4 clone using React. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EReact, also known as React JS, is a powerful JavaScript library used for building custom, interactive user interfaces using UI components. Some of the most well known examples of organizations using React for their front-end include Netflix, Facebook, and Airbnb. Developed and maintained by Meta along with a community of independent developers, React remains free and open-source. React is a component based library built entirely on JavaScript, which makes it perfect for designing complex UI\u2019s. With React, developers can build encapsulated components that efficiently manage their own state and render UI updates specifically when data changes. For example, think of the automated content refresh feature you see on a twitter feed, or Facebook like button. Here the state of the UI component changes on the page, without having to manually refresh when the data is updated. This is just one small, yet powerful feature of React.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThrough a complete hands-on project, this course will teach you all the fundamental principles of React that you must know to become a proficient React developer. We start with the tools needed to get started with React, along with instructions on creating the Connect-4 game board. From there we dive in to React OnClick Events, Passing Props, Destructing, React Children, and Passing Arguments. With a solid understanding of the foundations, students move on to various styling techniques for the game components, along with Dynamic classes, and handling callbacks. Here we\u2019ll explore inline, global, and dynamic styling coupled with dynamic classes. We will then move on to the React State Hook, React Key Property and initializing the game modules. Students then tackle more intermediate concepts including the logical components of calculating a winner, determining a draw, and React Lifecycle events. In the last module, we explore the implementation of AI for automated move suggestions, and single player games.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn addition to the hands-on React module, we also offer a comprehensive overview of JavaScript for those who need a refresher. Here we start with introducing students to the document object model (DOM) which defines the logical structure of HTML documents. From there we dive into JavaScript to demonstrate various methods in which DOM elements can be manipulated to add interactivity to static components. We start right from the basics, which includes JavaScript placement, and data output. From there we move on to variable declaration, arithmetic operations, operator precedence, data types, and objects. Once the foundations are covered, we move on to more complex operations using Arrays, Conditional Statements, JavaScript comparison operators, Booleans and loops. Here students will learn to unleash the true power of JavaScript to render different outcomes based on user interaction. We will explore the use of functions to efficiently handle repetitive tasks and JavaScript events to handle output based on actions and occurrences. The section will conclude with a hands-on project where students will implement their knowledge to build a web based photo gallery and background color changer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/build-a-connect-4-clone-in-react-javascript-foundations/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4789918_7294.jpg","duration":"5.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"25,075.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Students interested in learning how to build interactive web pages using JavaScript","Students interested in learning ReactJS","Students interested in front-end UI Development using React","Students interested in learning JavaScript Foundations"],"tags":["JavaScript","React JS"],"rating":{"count":79,"averageValue":"4.2"},"instructors":[{"name":"YouAccel Training","url":"/user/youaccel/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.280488}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"YOUACCEL57611","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"3 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/creative-infographics-in-powerpoint/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":2800692,"title":"Creative Infographics in PowerPoint","shortDescription":"Do a fun and eye-catching Informational Graphic in PowerPoint","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EYou certainly know that boring PowerPoint presentation can kill a brilliant idea?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EIs there a way to make it better, way better? \u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESure, and I\u0027ll tell you how! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EA tip\u003C/em\u003E: \u003C/strong\u003Euse data to make your presentation more convincing.

We start right from the ground up, where students will learn to navigate the Lightroom interface, create image catalogs and import hundreds of images for the purpose of sorting and organizing photo collections. Here we will explore important concepts such as catalog settings, import file handling, auto renaming, metadata presets, and import preferences. Once students are familiar with the basics, we take a theoretical dive into a number of concepts and key terms that are essential in the photography and digital image editing arena. Here we will explore various file formats, color spaces, image resolution, pixel density, and much more. From there, we transition back to completing application setup by exploring file handling options, interface preferences, identity plate setup, and watermarking with both text and graphics.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOnce we\u2019ve covered the foundations, students will take a deep dive into the Lightroom Library Module. The library module is an integral part of the Lightroom application, which is used for a number of important functions. This includes populating, sorting, and organizing image collection sets. This section starts from the basics, where we explore the Library interface. From there, students learn to filter files, paint keywords, and generate keyword sets. We\u2019ll also demonstrate how to use various library views for image comparison, and advanced sorting. Once students have a handle of the foundations, we cover more intermediate sorting techniques using star ratings, pick and reject flags, color labels, and smart collections. We then transition to working with the library attribute filter, adding folders, building smart previews, and an overview of the quick develop panel for basic image enhancements.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAs you can see this course covers a number of topics that are essential to anyone starting off in the digital image enhancement arena. It\u2019s also a great resource for both professional and aspiring photographers that are looking to take their existing shots to the next level.

More formally, discrete mathematics has been characterized as the branch of mathematics dealing with countable sets (finite sets or sets with the same cardinality as the natural numbers). However, there is no exact definition of the term \u0022discrete mathematics.\u0022 Indeed, discrete mathematics is described less by what is included than by what is excluded: continuously varying quantities and related notions.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/mathematics-software-development/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/3482670_925d.jpg","duration":"6.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"61,388.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Beginner Java Developers","Beginner Python Developers","Beginner C \u0026 C\u002B\u002B Developers","Computer Science Students","Engineering Students","Employees in Programming Companies"],"tags":["C\u002B\u002B","Computer Science","Discrete Math","Functional Programming"],"rating":{"count":231,"averageValue":"3.7"},"instructors":[{"name":"Martin Yanev","url":"/user/martin-yanev-3/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.1904764},{"name":"Plamen Yanev","url":"/user/plamen-yanev/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.1904764}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"MAY-FREE","originalPrice":"\u20B92,299","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/basic-english-vocabulary-and-synonyms/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5111086,"title":"English vocabulary","shortDescription":"English vocabulary-crossword-wordsearch","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EThis English Vocabulary course is designed to help learners improve their vocabulary skills in a fun, interactive, and engaging way.

Digital cameras\u003Cstrong\u003E \u003C/strong\u003Eare built into doorbells; your smartphone tracks your daily movements from work to home and back; and you receive social media updates when you go to the gym, see a show, or visit a new city. Digital technology tracks your phone calls, bank transactions, and medical appointments. What about criminal or unethical behavior if it tracks your mundane daily activities?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat activity is also monitored, and as a\u003Cstrong\u003E \u003C/strong\u003Edigital forensic investigator, you\u0027ll need to understand where digital evidence is stored and how to analyse it. There is almost no criminal activity that does not involve digital evidence, and it is your responsibility as an investigator to gather all available evidence, process it, and present your findings to the authorities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInvestigators who work in the field of digital forensics must have a diverse set of skills and interests. The first question I ask anyone thinking about a career in this field is if they enjoy solving puzzles. You may not have access to any information other than the fact that something happened when investigating a case. So, if someone needs to be shown or told what happened, this field may not be right for them. When a case is brought to an investigator\u0027s attention, the investigator is often given instructions to figure out what the computer or device was used for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother important trait is the ability to deal with frustration, as investigative tools and software do not always work without problems. When it comes to cell phones and small devices, this is a fairly common occurrence. Many students, rather than working through the challenges, stop their investigation in class at the first sign of difficulty. They don\u0027t even try to figure out what\u0027s wrong with the tool by looking at the web or using the help system. To be a successful investigator, one must be persistent and creative \u2013 they must be problem solvers. Digital forensics is a branch of forensic science that collects, analyses, documents, and presents digital evidence related to computer crime for use in a court of law using scientific knowledge. Knowing what was done, when it was done, and who did it is the ultimate goal. The term \u201Cdigital forensics\u201D is often used interchangeably with \u201Ccomputer forensics\u201D (also known as \u201Ccyber forensics\u201D), but it has come to encompass all devices capable of storing digital data, including networking devices, mobile phones, tablets, digital cameras, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, digital home appliances, and other digital storage media such as CD/DVD, USB drives, SD cards, external drives, and backup tapes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComputer Forensics is a specialization that deals with the recovery, examination and investigation of digital evidence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComputer Forensics is an applied science that deals with the recovery, examination and investigation of digital evidence.

Cyberthreats refer to vulnerabilities in IT and software systems, like malware attacks, piracy, unauthorized ERP access and unintentional or maliciously injected backdoors in the purchased, open source or proprietary software used by organizations. Supply chain security here primarily involves minimizing risks from using software developed by another organization, and securing organizational data accessed by another organization in your supply chain. Organizations cannot take for granted that the software that they use or purchase is secure. Because close collaboration is often required between businesses, suppliers and resellers, computer networks may become intertwined or sensitive data shared. This can result in a breach of one organization affecting many. Instead of attacking the target directly, a cybercriminal may attack a weaker organization in the target\u0027s supply chain and use that access to meet their goals. Many are responding to recent supply chain attacks such as the SolarWinds attacks by, for example, reducing reliance on foreign suppliers and building primarily domestic supply chains. Some companies are moving production out of foreign factories to domestic ones as well.
