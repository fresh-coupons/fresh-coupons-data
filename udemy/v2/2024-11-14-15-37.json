Hashing is a process of converting a given input into a fixed-size alphanumeric string. The output of a hash function is often referred to as a message digest or simply, a hash. A good hash function satisfies the following properties: it is easy to compute the hash value for any given message, it is infeasible to generate two different messages that result in the same hash value, it is infeasible to modify a message without changing its hash value, and it is infeasible to determine the original message from its hash value.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWhen used properly, hashing can be an effective way to store sensitive data such as passwords while keeping them safe from prying eyes.
