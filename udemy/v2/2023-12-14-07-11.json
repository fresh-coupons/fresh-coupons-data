I have always been a firm believer in learning by doing and in this course, you will learn what you need to know by hands-on experience. You don\u2019t need any special knowledge except basic computer skills to get started with the course. Every one of you comes from a different background and hence the course is crafted from basic to advanced level with minute details in every lecture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe course is divided into 8 sections. In the first section, you will learn in detail about the Asus tinker board and how it is different from its competitor Raspberry Pi.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the second section, we will understand how to burn the OS image to the SD card and use the tinker board as a full-fledged PC. Once we are done with this we will go ahead and understand the IP scanner tool and then use the putty application to access the Linux terminal of the Asus tinker board.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStarting on a Tinker board is not always easy because you don\u2019t necessarily have the habit of using command lines. However, they are essentials and often faster or more efficient than going through the GUI. So in the third section, we will get to know about all the day to day usage Linux commands with practical examples.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fourth section begins with remotely accessing the graphical user interface of the tinker board and understanding the basic GUI applications. Once we are done with this we will go ahead and understand the general-purpose input-output functionality.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the fifth section, we will step into the world of physical computing. We will begin with a basic project where we will learn to program different LEDs and a buzzer. This will help us to understand the GPIO pin structure and how to use them for programming.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe sixth section exposes you to the intermediate level of project development. Here, you will learn to build automatic garden lights. This project will solve your day to day problems of manually turning the light ON in the evening and then turning it off again in the morning. You will learn to program and automate things as per your requirements.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the seventh section, we will go ahead with the advanced project where we will learn to build our own home automation project. We will first understand about the IoT and how it is implemented in real-time. You will learn to control your home appliances from anywhere. For example, If you are in the US, you will be able to turn off your lights from the UK.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, in the eight section, you will come to know how to transfer files remotely from PC to Tinker Board. You will also go through what you have learned so far in the entire course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease note that the project covered in the course will work on any version of the Tinker Board.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAll the lectures contain English subtitles for clear and better understanding. If you face any technical issues, please post your query in the question and answer section and I will get back to you within 1 business day.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the end of the course, you will have a solid foundation on tinker board, relay and sensor usage, IoT dashboard implementation, etc. So apart from building this project, you will also find it easy to build any other project of your choice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank You\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/getting-stared-with-asus-tinker-board/","imageUri":"https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/3503994_2632_7.jpg","duration":"2 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"14,091.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["For beginners who wants to explore the latest Tinker Board","Who wants to build real-time projects to solve day to day problems"],"tags":["Internet Of Things"],"rating":{"count":34,"averageValue":"4.5"},"instructors":[{"name":"Stepwise Learning .","url":"/user/stepwiselearning/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.35},{"name":"Technical Support Team","url":"/user/comfiny-support-team/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.35}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"TWITTER7","originalPrice":"\u20B91,999","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"9 hours","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/app-android-sistema-para-karaoke-en-xamarin-forms-2020/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":3336174,"title":"App android \u002B Sistema para Karaoke en Xamarin Forms (2021)","shortDescription":"Proyecto funcional y terminado","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EEn este proyecto aprenderas a crear una Aplicacion movil para Karaokes y un Sistema de gestion del mismo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELa aplicacion movil esta desarrollado Xamarin forms usando el lenguaje \u003Cstrong\u003EC\u003C/strong\u003E# y patron de software \u003Cstrong\u003EMVVM\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEl sistema de gestion esta desarrollado en \u003Cstrong\u003EC# \u003C/strong\u003Ey base de datos S\u003Cstrong\u003EQLServer\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELos Temas a ver en la aplicacion movil son:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModulo de pedidos\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModulo de introduccion\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnimacion de degradados\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDise\u00F1os con degradados\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EListview personalizados\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVentanas emergentes personalizados\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConexion a SQLServer\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECreacion de Apk\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPublicacion de la aplicacion en PlayStore\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPatron de software MVVM\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELector de codigos QR\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEscaneo de codigo QR para la conexion\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPedidos de canciones extras\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELos temas a ver en sistema de gestion son:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModulo de canciones\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModulo de pedidos\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModulo de mesas\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModulo de codigos QR\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAsistente de instalacion automatizada\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECreacion de ejecutables portables con base de datos Incluido\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDise\u00F1o de interfaces por codigo\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArquitectura de software en 3 capas\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConexiones encryptadas a SQLServer\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEscaneo de codigo QR para la conexion\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEn el 2021\u003C/strong\u003E xamarin esta siendo utilizado para aplicaciones robustas y funcionales.

An IPO allows a company to raise equity capital from public investors. The transition from a private to a public company can be an important time for private investors to fully realize gains from their investment as it typically includes a share premium for current private investors. Meanwhile, it also allows public investors to participate in the offering.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first step in the IPO process is for the issuing company to choose an investment bank to advise the company on its IPO and to provide underwriting services. Underwriting is the process through which an investment bank (the underwriter) acts as a broker between the issuing company and the investing public to help the issuing company sell its initial set of shares. After the IPO is approved by the SEC, the effective date is decided. On the day before the effective date, the issuing company and the underwriter decide the offer price (i.e., the price at which the shares will be sold by the issuing company) and the precise number of shares to be sold. Deciding the offer price is important because it is the price at which the issuing company raises capital for itself. After the issue has been brought to the market, the underwriter has to provide analyst recommendations, after-market stabilization, and create a market for the stock issued. The final stage of the IPO process, the transition to market competition, starts 25 days after the initial public offering, once the \u201Cquiet period\u201D mandated by the SEC ends.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/fund-raising-through-ipos-and-fpos/","imageUri":"https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5621716_e72a.jpg","duration":"3 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"1,724.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Students and Professionals"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":5,"averageValue":"4.4"},"instructors":[{"name":"EDUCBA Bridging the Gap","url":"/user/premananda-suna/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.6}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"EDUCBADEC12","originalPrice":"\u20B91,999","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/mvvm-para-xamarin-forms-la-guia-definitiva/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4487184,"title":"Xamarin intermedio: Dise\u00F1os profesionales","shortDescription":"Aprende practicando","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003ELa experiencia del desarrollador de Xamarin.Forms normalmente implica crear una interfaz de usuario en XAML y luego agregar c\u00F3digo subyacente que opera en la interfaz de usuario.

It is platform-independent and easily portable. Java can be used to develop web applications, standalone GUI applications and complex large-scale distributed applications to enable the resolution of complex solutions more easily. Java is an object-oriented Programming Language and functional features have been added in the recently released Java versions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJava was developed and is being maintained by Oracle Corporation. It is a general-purpose programming language which has concurrent and multi-threading programming features. Java is safe, static and strongly typed programming language. Java has a special runtime environment called JRE which provided an execution environment instances called Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to enable the running of Java applications as Java bytecodes (conversion of high-level code to machine level code). The theme of the Java application development is Write Once and Run Anywhere while developing applications. It is most popular in client-server application development.

Welcome to Master Practical Java Development. This course is designed to help you master the most in-demand and critical components for becoming a Core Java developer. Especially if you\u0027re going for a job interview or have a Java Project that needs your best performance. This course assumes no prior java experience so prior Java so it will take you from zero to hero. The topics covered include Object Orientation which I think is not stressed enough in other Java courses so I\u0027ve got special focus on that throughout the lectures. You\u0027ll get plenty of practice writing classes and interfaces as well as countless methods with loops and if else statements, exception handling and file processing as well as how to debug software using Eclipse. You\u0027ll also be mastering the collections framework and diving deep into java generics. You\u0027ll learn all there is to know about multi-threading and the JDBC API for working with a MySQL database. There are also practical projects scattered throughout the course so that you can practice the concepts as you learn them.
