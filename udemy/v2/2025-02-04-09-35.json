The user inputs the string through an HTML form and the result is displayed on the page, styled with CSS. The project uses a recursive function to check if the string is a palindrome. The function starts at the beginning and end of the string and compares the characters at each index. If the characters are the same, the function continues to the next index. If the characters are not the same, the function returns false.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERGB Color Generator:\u003C/strong\u003E This project generates random RGB (red, green, blue) color values using JavaScript. The generated color is displayed on an HTML page, with the background color changing to the generated color. The page can be styled with CSS. The project uses the Math. random() function to generate random numbers between 0 and 255. The three random numbers are used to create an RGB color value.

The count value is displayed on an HTML page and buttons can be added to increment and decrement the count. The page can be styled with CSS. The project uses two variables to store the count value and the button click event handlers to increment and decrement the count value.

The user inputs the character through an HTML form and the result is displayed on the page, styled with CSS. The project uses the String.fromCharCode() function to convert the character to a string. The charCodeAt() function is then used to get the ASCII code of the character. If the ASCII code is between 0 and 127, the character is an ASCII character. Otherwise, the character is a Unicode character.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAnalog Clock Application:\u003C/strong\u003E This project displays an analog clock with the current time on an HTML page using JavaScript.
