These \u0022units\u0022 can be customers, orders, products, or any other relevant metric. Analyzing unit economics helps companies and experts assess the sustainability and profitability of their operations.

It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E* Javascript Course Contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Introduction\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Array\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Variables\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Functions\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Objects\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Control Statements\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Cookies\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Loop statements\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Data Structures\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Error Handling\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Regular Expressions\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESee you inside the course\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-for-beginners-complete-course/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4200368_f71e_5.jpg","duration":"2 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"135,056.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["For Javascript  Programming Beginners","For People New to Javascript","For People Who want to learn Javascript Fundamentals and later Transition into Web Development"],"tags":["JavaScript"],"rating":{"count":1955,"averageValue":"4.4"},"instructors":[{"name":"PROPER DOT INSTITUTE","url":"/user/vivek-dahibhate-2/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.367021}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"F10A0A6740D68571E4E4","originalPrice":"\u20B91,499","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/kotlin-mastering-complete-kotlin-web-development-course/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5886332,"title":"Kotlin Mastering: Complete Kotlin Web Development Course","shortDescription":"Mastering Complete Kotlin Web Development Course.

A course for anyone who wants to build career in management","What are Mergers and Acquisitions (M\u0026A)?  Merger: Two companies of relatively similar size combine forces to create a new, single entity. This is often a move for market expansion or gaining a competitive edge.  Acquisition: One company purchases a majority stake or all of another company. The acquiring company gains control of the acquired company\u0027s assets and operations. This can be done to enter new markets, eliminate competition, or gain new technology resources.","Key Pitfalls in M\u0026A  Culture Clash: Combining distinct company cultures can lead to employee conflicts, low morale, and a decline in productivity.  Overpaying: Enthusiasm can lead companies to overpay for an acquisition, resulting in financial losses down the line.  Poor Integration: Failure to smoothly integrate systems, processes, and teams creates operational chaos and hinders the potential of the combined entity.  Lack of Due Diligence: Insufficient research about the target company\u0027s financial health, legal standing, or market position might expose hidden liabilities and risks.  Loss of Focus: The complexity of the M\u0026A process can distract from core business operations, leading to neglected customers or missed opportunities.","Why is Learning About M\u0026A Important for Companies and Managers?  Strategic Growth: M\u0026A can be a powerful tool to expand into new markets, acquire new technologies, eliminate competitors, or increase market share significantly.  Responding to Market Changes Companies must adapt to industry shifts. An M\u0026A strategy can be vital for staying ahead of the competition or even surviving.  Leadership Development: M\u0026A success relies heavily on the ability of managers to navigate complexity, integrate teams, and make crucial decisions under pressure.","How Can M\u0026A Skills Support Career Development?  Increased Demand: As M\u0026A activity continues to be prevalent, professionals with these skills are highly sought after by companies, investment banks, and consulting firms.  Leadership Opportunities: M\u0026A skills signal strategic thinking, problem-solving abilities, and a talent for execution \u2013 all assets for leadership roles.  Broader Skillset: M\u0026A involves exposure to various aspects of business such as finance, valuation, negotiation, and legal, thus developing a more versatile skillset.
