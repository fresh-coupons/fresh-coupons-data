We will start working with the basic fundamentals of PHP like \u0022echo statements\u0022, \u0022comments\u0022 and stuff like that up to the intermediate level and then to the advanced parts like \u0022super globals\u0022, \u0022date and time\u0022 and so on.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe other part of the course is very simple and yet practical crucial and useful and that is \u0022building a todolist with PHP and MySQL\u0022. and in it, I am going to walk you through the process of building this little app, so you can apply what you have learnt. I am also going to show you how to think and analyze in terms of code and this will unlock your potential as a programmer and allow you to get out of the tutorial hell which kills every programmer\u0027s possibility of getting ahead.\u003Cbr\u003EThe course also contains material as in code snippets and source codes for the project applied and quizzes and so on. if you are ready to take this journey with me, then go ahead and take this course.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"Ingl\u00EAs","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-php-for-beginners-php-crash-course-2021/","imageUri":"https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/3755422_4493_3.jpg?secure=_u3kIconATq3ZTwdekdHtQ%3D%3D%2C1646406089","duration":"4 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"90.194 alunos","lastUpdated":"\u00DAltima atualiza\u00E7\u00E3o em 12/2021","targetAudiences":["Anyone who is interested in learning PHP"],"tags":["Desenvolvimento","Desenvolvimento Web","PHP"],"rating":{"count":667,"averageValue":"4.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"Web Coding","url":"/user/bdb27e95-65f5-415a-956b-65f62ba4bfc3/","totalNumberOfStudents":261788,"totalNumberOfReviews":3007,"averageRating":4.110792716}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"PHPCOURSE48","originalPrice":"1\u00A0280\u00A0\u20B9","discountedPrice":"\u0411\u0435\u0441\u043F\u043B\u0430\u0442\u043D\u043E","expirationText":"4 \u0434\u043D\u0435\u0439","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/depression-counseling-made-simpler-and-effective-major-despressive/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4420310,"title":"Become Depression Counselor - Major Depressive Disorder","shortDescription":"Provide Effective Depression Counseling to Clients with MDD.

A result-oriented approach to improve your counselling skill\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this course, I share the unique insights that I\u0026nbsp;have learned through my years in counselling depressive clients. Knowledge builds upon the knowledge, so it is always a good idea to learn from other mental health professionals. I share useful analogies, mindset shifts, tools \u0026amp; techniques in this course that you can directly use in your counselling sessions. The resources are in open word format that you can customize according to your needs and share with your clients to track their improvements and make progress.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E__\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHey, everybody Aman Varma (CBT/DBT/ACT) here, I\u0027m a\u003Cstrong\u003E \u003C/strong\u003Ecounsellor and in this course, I will be sharing with you unique insights and some tools that can help you conduct your depressive client counselling in a much more effective way. Throughout my experience of counselling many clients on depression, I have learned something unique, something that nobody else might know so I have decided that I will share with you all those insights all those resources in this course. Now, the thing is that there are some clients that are very difficult to \u0022treat\u0022 in a sense. No matter how much therapy you apply to them, no matter how many tools and techniques you give them they just cannot seem to come out of depression and this affects not only our business but also our objectives as mental health professionals to help people.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if you want to conduct more effective therapy it is very useful to learn and gain insights from people or from counsellors who are doing such things. Getting a lot of different perspectives on the same thing can enhance our skills and can make our counseling much more effective. Sometimes we face \u0022stubborn depressive\u0022 clients, meaning nothing helps them to bounce back. So we can use the experiences of other counsellors in such scenarios. That is what I do too. If i am stuck somewhere with my counseling i often go out and network with other counselors and see if they have come across such a problem and they share their unique insights with me that help me help my clients get out of depression.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo this course is basically me offloading all my insights and my experiences that I have gone through in the past years treating clients with depression and in addition that I was too having depression I had gone through MDD (major depressive disorder) and Cyclothymia. I also share my personal experience my first-hand insight into what depression looks like for a depressed person so you get both the perspectives in this course one of the counsellors and one of a patient or a client and then you can apply those in your practice, you can share those insights with your clients so that they get a broader understanding of themselves of how they should be working towards solving their depression problem. I hope you will enjoy this course, this is a unique course the content in this course is not something that you will find outside because this is all my authentic experiences and insight so I highly suggest you take this course because knowledge builds upon knowledge in some way, shape or form this knowledge will help you in your personal life, in your professional life and also help you boom your business! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope you will consider this course I will see you on the inside :)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAbout Instructor:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAman Varma has undergone accredited course training in CBT practitioner, Diploma in Hypnotherapy, Mental Health Practitioner, NLP Specialist Practitioner, Diploma in Psychological Counseling and Diploma in Modern Applied Psychology.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"Ingl\u00EAs","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/depression-counseling-made-simpler-and-effective-major-despressive/","imageUri":"https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4420310_71aa_5.jpg?secure=rDa8nFaPCzJzPShU9Oz08g%3D%3D%2C1646406120","duration":"3 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"3.129 alunos","lastUpdated":"\u00DAltima atualiza\u00E7\u00E3o em 1/2022","targetAudiences":["Psychologists/Counselors  who are having difficulty treating clients with MDD","Psychologists/Counselors who have started a new business and feel unclear how to proceed with MDD clients","Psychologists/Counselors if your practice is ineffective because you lack frameworks, insights, and worksheets for helping clients with MDD","Psychologists/Counselors who have never helped depressive clients"],"tags":["Sa\u00FAde e fitness","Sa\u00FAde geral","Aconselhamento"],"rating":{"count":17,"averageValue":"4.2"},"instructors":[{"name":"Psychology Online","url":"/user/cb802548-f70d-45ca-9f85-fd5a02ea9e3e/","totalNumberOfStudents":24692,"totalNumberOfReviews":440,"averageRating":4.182809022222223}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"D2F613A4D074B2A7C2FD","originalPrice":"5\u00A0440\u00A0\u20B9","discountedPrice":"\u0411\u0435\u0441\u043F\u043B\u0430\u0442\u043D\u043E","expirationText":"4 \u0434\u043D\u0435\u0439","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-clf-c01-practise-tests/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4409068,"title":"AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C01) Practise Exams","shortDescription":"AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C01)","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EAWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C01) Practise Tests is there to aid and prepare you for the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C01)\u0026nbsp; exam.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe test comprises out of selected questions and topics covered in the exam so you can pass your exam successfully.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner credential, organizations can identify and develop employees with critical knowledge about implementing cloud initiatives.

A person would be able to redo and reproduce an origami by unfolding it first. Knowing how cars work requires understanding each major and minor mechanical part and their purposes. The complex nature of the human anatomy requires people to understand each and every part of the body. How? By dissecting it. Reverse engineering is a way for us to understand how things were designed, why is it in its state, when it triggers, how it works, and what its purpose is. In effect, the information is used to redesign and improve for better performance and cost. It can even help fix defects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is amazing, and rather disconcerting, to realize how much software we run without knowing for sure what it does. We buy software off the shelf in shrink wrapped packages. We run setup utilities that install numerous files, change system settings, delete or disable older versions and superseded utilities, and modify critical registry files. Every time we access a Website, we may invoke or interact with dozens of programs and code segments that are necessary to give us the intended look, feel, and behaviour. We purchase CDs with hundreds of games and utilities or download them as shareware. We exchange useful programs with colleagues and friends when we have tried only a fraction of each program\u2019s features. Then, we download updates and install patches, trusting that the vendors are sure that the changes are correct and complete. We blindly hope that the latest change to each program keeps it compatible with all of the rest of the programs on our system. We rely on much software that we do not understand and do not know very well at all. I refer to a lot more than our desktop or laptop personal computers. The concept of ubiquitous computing, or \u201Csoftware everywhere,\u201D is rapidly putting software control and interconnection in devices throughout our environment. The average automobile now has more lines of software code in its engine controls than were required to land the Apollo astronauts on the Moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMalware analysis is the study of malware\u0027s behaviour. The objective of malware analysis is to understand the working of malware and how to detect and eliminate it. It involves analysing the suspect binary in a safe environment to identify its characteristics and functionalities so that better defences can be built to protect an organization\u0027s network.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImagine if the Trojan Horse was thoroughly inspected and torn down before it was allowed to enter the gates of a city. This would probably cause a few dead soldiers outside the gate fighting for the city. The next time the city is sent another Trojan Horse, archers would know where to point their arrows. And no dead soldiers this time. The same is true for malware analysis\u2014by knowing the behaviours of a certain malware through reverse engineering, the analyst can recommend various safeguards for the network. Think of it as the Trojan Horse being the malware, the analyst being the soldier who initially inspected the horse, and the city being the network of computers.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"Ingl\u00EAs","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/reverse-engineering-and-malware-analysis/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4539592_c997_4.jpg","duration":"9 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"2.209 alunos","lastUpdated":"\u00DAltima atualiza\u00E7\u00E3o em 2/2022","targetAudiences":["Beginner Reverse Engineers who curious about learning Reverse Engineering","Beginner Malware Analyst who curious about learning Malware Analysis"],"tags":["TI e software","Rede e seguran\u00E7a","Engenharia reversa"],"rating":{"count":2,"averageValue":"5.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"OCSALY - Online Computer Science Academy","url":"/user/online-academy-of-computer-science/","totalNumberOfStudents":32427,"totalNumberOfReviews":193,"averageRating":4.039863749101796}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"CRMA100OFF","originalPrice":"\u20B912.160","discountedPrice":"\u20B97.904","expirationText":"5 horas","discountPercentage":35}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/bitcoin-university/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4571378,"title":"Bitcoin University: Build \u0026 Grow Your Wealth with Bitcoin","shortDescription":"The Complete Bitcoin Course to Help You Build, Grow \u0026 Protect Your Wealth","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBitcoin is taking over the digital currency sector by storm, with digital currencies already being termed the money of the future.\u003C/strong\u003E Many traders take advantage of Bitcoin to earn passive income and diversify their investments in the process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy taking this course, you\u2019ll learn about the fundamentals of cryptocurrency and the blockchain which will teach you how Bitcoin fits into the whole digital currency story.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirstly, you\u2019ll start by learning the general introduction to money and the background and history of Bitcoin.

It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat are the steps I should follow to be able to build a Machine Learning model?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can divide your learning process into 3 parts:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStatistics and Probability - Implementing Machine learning techniques require basic knowledge of Statistics and probability concepts. Second section of the course covers this part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnderstanding of Machine learning - Fourth section helps you understand the terms and concepts associated with Machine learning and gives you the steps to be followed to build a machine learning model\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProgramming Experience - A significant part of machine learning is programming. Python and R clearly stand out to be the leaders in the recent days. Third section will help you set up the Python environment and teach you some basic operations. In later sections there is a video on how to implement each concept taught in theory lecture in Python\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnderstanding of models - Fifth and sixth section cover Classification models and with each theory lecture comes a corresponding practical lecture where we actually run each query with you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy use R for Machine Learning?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnderstanding R is one of the valuable skills needed for a career in Machine Learning. Below are some reasons why you should learn Machine learning in R\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. It\u2019s a popular language for Machine Learning at top tech firms. Almost all of them hire data scientists who use R. Facebook, for example, uses R to do behavioral analysis with user post data. Google uses R to assess ad effectiveness and make economic forecasts. And by the way, it\u2019s not just tech firms: R is in use at analysis and consulting firms, banks and other financial institutions, academic institutions and research labs, and pretty much everywhere else data needs analyzing and visualizing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Learning the data science basics is arguably easier in R than Python. R has a big advantage: it was designed specifically with data manipulation and analysis in mind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Amazing packages that make your life easier. As compared to Python, R was designed with statistical analysis in mind, it has a fantastic ecosystem of packages and other resources that are great for data science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Robust, growing community of data scientists and statisticians. As the field of data science has exploded, usage of R and Python has exploded with it, becoming one of the fastest-growing languages in the world (as measured by StackOverflow). That means it\u2019s easy to find answers to questions and community guidance as you work your way through projects in R.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Put another tool in your toolkit. No one language is going to be the right tool for every job. Like Python, adding R to your repertoire will make some projects easier \u2013 and of course, it\u2019ll also make you a more flexible and marketable employee when you\u2019re looking for jobs in data science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat are the major advantages of using R over Python?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs compared to Python, R has a higher user base and the biggest number of statistical packages and libraries available. Although, Python has almost all features that analysts need, R triumphs over Python.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ER is a function-based language, whereas Python is object-oriented. If you are coming from a purely statistical background and are not looking to take over major software engineering tasks when productizing your models, R is an easier option, than Python.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ER has more data analysis functionality built-in than Python, whereas Python relies on Packages\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPython has main packages for data analysis tasks, R has a larger ecosystem of small packages\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGraphics capabilities are generally considered better in R than in Python\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ER has more statistical support in general than Python\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat is the difference between Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPut simply, machine learning and data mining use the same algorithms and techniques as data mining, except the kinds of predictions vary.
