In this course, we will cover three main parts. The first part covers the essentials of traditional computer vision pipeline, and how to deal with images in OpenCV and Pillow libraries, including the image pre-processing pipeline like:\u0026nbsp; thresholding, denoising, blurring, filtering, edge detection,\u0026nbsp; contours...etc. We will build simple apps like Car License Plate Detection (LPD) and activity recogntion. This will lead us to the revolution that deep learning brought to the game of computer vision, turning traditional filters into learnable parameters using Convolution Neural Networks. We will cover all the basics of ConvNets, including the details of the Vanilla architecture for image classification, hyper parameters like kernels, strides, maxpool and feature maps sizes calculations. Beyond the Vanilla architecture, we also cover the state-of-the art ConvNet meta-architectures and design patters, like skip-connnections, Inception, DenseNet...etc. In the second part, we will learn how to use ConvNets to solve practical problems in different situations, with small amount of data, how to use transfer learning and the different scenarios for that, and finally how to debug and visualize the leant kernels in ConvNets. In the last part, we will learn about different CV\u0026nbsp;apps using ConvNets. We will learn about the Encoder-Decoder design pattern. We start by the task of semantic segmentation, where we will build a U-Net architecture from scratch for the Cambridge Video (CAMVID) dataset. Then we will learn about Object Detection, covering both 2-stage and one-shot architectures like SSD and YOLO. Next, we will learn how to deal with the video data using the Spatio-Temporal ConvNet architectures. Finally we will introduce 3D Deep Learning to extend ConvNets usage to deal with 3D data, like LiDAR data.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"Arabic","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/deep-learning-for-computer-vision/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4661416_29ea.jpg","duration":"10 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"8,506.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Beginner level computer vision engineer"],"tags":["Deep Learning"],"rating":{"count":250,"averageValue":"4.8"},"instructors":[{"name":"Coursat.ai Dr. Ahmad ElSallab","url":"/user/coursatai/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.76}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"DC938ECD77874BD2BE8B","originalPrice":"\u20B92,699","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/c-level-management-proven-frameworks-and-techniques/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5424112,"title":"C-level management: proven frameworks and techniques","shortDescription":"Meet and exceed your career goals to become a visionary leader and executive leader","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to our C-Level Management Course, where leadership meets excellence.

It starts with setting the boundaries of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and their relation to Data Science. What is expected as a member an AI team, and how to speak the same language. What is possible and what is not, and what defines a good AI project. The basics of supervised learning are covered, including the main ingredients of the Machine Learning problem, and the different solution setups. We cover both Linear models (Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM)) and Non-linear models (Polynomial Regression, Kernel SVM, Deep Neural Networks (DNN)). A universal approach is given to tackle any ML problem in a systematic way, covering data preparation, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Model selection, Model evaluation, Model design, Fine tuning and Regularization. An end-to-end is given to illustrate this process with code in Google Colab Notebooks. We also cover the Machine Learning Meta algorithms and Ensemble methods: Voting, BAGGing, Boosting Decision Trees and Random Forests. Finally, we introduce unsupervised learning, covering dimensionality reduction algorithms, like Manifold Learning like Locally Linear Embedding (LLE) and Projection methods like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Clustering, like K-Means.

We will demonstrate how Deep Learning has re-shaped this area of Artificial Intelligence using concepts like word vectors and embeddings, strucutured deep learning, collaborative filtering, recurrent neural networks, sequence-to-sequence models and transformer networks. In our journey, we will be mostly concerned with how to represent the language tokens, being at the word or character level, and and how to represent their aggregation, like sentences or documents, in a semantically sound way. We start the journey by going through the traditional pipeline of text pre-processing and the different text features like binary and TF-IDF\u0026nbsp;features with the Bag-of-Words model. Then we will dive into the concepts of word vectors and embeddings as a general deep learning concept, with detailed discussion of famous word embedding techniques like word2vec, GloVe, Fasttext and ELMo. This will enable us to divert into recommender systems, using collaborative filtering and twin-tower model as an example of the generic usage of embeddings beyond word representations. In the second part of the course, we will be concerned with sentence and sequence representations. We will tackle the core NLP of Langauge Modeling, at statistical and neural levels, using recurrent models, like LSTM\u0026nbsp;and GRU. In the following part, we tackle sequence-to-sequence models, with the flagship NLP\u0026nbsp;task of Machine Translation, which paves the way to talk about many other tasks under the same design seq2seq pattern, like Question-Answering and Chatbots. We present the core idea idea of Attention mechanisms with recurrent seq2seq, before we generalize it as a generic deep learning concept. This generalization leads to the to the state-of-the art Transformer Network, which revolutionized the world of NLP, using full attention mechanisms. In the final part of the course, we present the ImageNet moment of NLP, where Transfer Learning comes into play together with pre-trained Transfomer architectures like BERT, GPT 1-2-3, RoBERTa, ALBERT, XLTransformer and XLNet.\u0026nbsp; \u003C/p\u003E","language":"Arabic","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/deep-learning-for-natural-language-processing/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4663084_3dd8.jpg","duration":"11 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"11,789.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Beginner level NLP engineers and data scientists"],"tags":["Deep Learning"],"rating":{"count":305,"averageValue":"4.6"},"instructors":[{"name":"Coursat.ai Dr. Ahmad ElSallab","url":"/user/coursatai/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.584746}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"25686B76F52544BD998B","originalPrice":"\u20B92,299","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/python-network-programming-for-network-engineers-python-3/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":1554180,"title":"Python Network Programming for Network Engineers (Python 3)","shortDescription":"Program networks using Python version 3.

This Microcontroller is called\u0026nbsp;DigiSpark.\u0026nbsp;It is a microcontroller\u0026nbsp;based on the Attiny85 development board. It is similar to Arduino but smaller and more powerful in terms of\u0026nbsp;hacking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstalling backdoors, exfiltrating documents, or capturing credentials is incredibly easy with a seemingly innocent USB drive called the USB\u0026nbsp; Rubber Ducky. An Expert hacker with a few minutes, photographic memory,\u0026nbsp; and perfect typing accuracy can use a few well-crafted keystrokes to hack virtually anything they have physical access to. However, the proper hardware can do the same thing every time on demand without fail.\u0026nbsp; That\u2019s where the Rubber Ducky and other Human Interface Devices (HID)\u0026nbsp; come into play. They inject keystrokes at superhuman speeds, violating computers\u0027 inherent trust in humans by posing as a keyboard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this class, we\u2019ll learn more about what HID attacks are, how they work,\u0026nbsp; the social engineering that can be involved in their deployment, and how to use them in your Pen-testing engagements. Keyboards announce themselves to computers as HID devices and are in turn automatically recognized and accepted. We\u0027ll program a microcontroller in Arduino to take advantage of this by acting as an HID device. We can then create scripts that run when the device is plugged into a target computer.

We\u0027ll go over creating more advanced loads, including tracking payloads that run in the background, as well as Rickroll payloads that can be used with permission from friends and family to demonstrate how HID attacks work. Additionally, students learn to automate nearly anything on an unattended device which can be extremely useful when you need to run the same commands on a series of computers.\u0026nbsp; That\u2019s how the Original USB Ruber Ducky was invented. Hak5 founder\u0026nbsp; Darren Kitchen, while working as a sysadmin, got tired of typing the same commands to fix printers and network shares, again and again, and the device evolved out of laziness.

Here also you discover that you still have a long Journey to go after your model is already performing great on your training machine. Finally, Software Engineers, who have their primary job is to build a working system or an app, often find themselves in a situation where they need to integrate an AI model in their software, which happens a lot today with the expansion of AI applications. They might get this model from a research team in their firm or company, or even use an API or pre-trained model on the internet to do their task.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe cover all those deployment scenarios, covering the journey from working trained model to an optimized deployed model. Our focus will be on CV deployment mainly. We cover Mobile deployment like on Android devices, Edge deployment on Embedded boards like Rasperry Pi, and Browser deployment where your AI model is running in the browser like Chrome, Edge, Safari or any other browser. Also, we cover server deployment scenarios, which are often found in highly scalable apps and systems with millions of users, and also in industrial scenarios like AI visual inspection in factories.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile the course is mostly practical, focusing on \u201CHow\u201D things are done and the best way of doing it, we cover also some theoretical parts about the \u201Cwhat\u201D and \u201Cwhy\u201D those techniques are used.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis requires sometimes to understand new types of convolution operations that are optimized for speed and memory, or understanding some model compression techniques that makes them suitable for Embedded and Edge deployments, which was not in scope during building the initial model that was already performing great.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"Arabic","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/deployment-of-machine-learning-models-l/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4833004_ca55.jpg","duration":"10 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"10,538.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Software Engineers","Data Scientists","Computer Vision Engineers","Machine Learning Engineers"],"tags":["Deep Learning","Machine Learning","Computer Vision","ML Model Deployment"],"rating":{"count":119,"averageValue":"4.8"},"instructors":[{"name":"Coursat.ai Dr. Ahmad ElSallab","url":"/user/coursatai/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.8}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"50D5DF6491E1447FA495","originalPrice":"\u20B92,499","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/online-course-creation-10-key-steps-from-idea-to-launch/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5896636,"title":"Online Course Creation: 10 Key Steps from Idea to Launch","shortDescription":"Master Online Course Creation and Create Your First Online Course Through 10 Simple Steps","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EAre you eager to share your expertise but find yourself at a crossroads on how to effectively package, market, and sell an online course?
