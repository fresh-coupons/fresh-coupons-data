Finally, we discuss the topic of relations - their types, how to create and invoke, handle them or activate events with triggers. At the end of the course, we will work on the data set in several tables connected by relations. In each section you will also find additional exercises that will allow you to check your knowledge and skills as well as notes summarizing the issues discussed.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/mysql-creating-and-managing-relational-databases/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/3208845_fb21_2.jpg","duration":"5.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"4,120.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["beginner database administrators","beginner database developers","students","people who need to organize their data systems","researchers","everyone interested"],"tags":["Database Management","Database Programming","MySQL","SQL"],"rating":{"count":47,"averageValue":"4.8"},"instructors":[{"name":"Krzysztof Raczynski","url":"/user/analogowy/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.736842}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"OCTOBER25","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"3 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/freebsd-13x-mastering-jails/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4860826,"title":"FreeBSD 13.x - Mastering JAILS","shortDescription":"Using FreeBSD Jails for securely running software packages using a pragmatic approach.","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EHello,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewelcome to the \u2018FreeBSD 13.x - Mastering JAILS\u2019 course.

It is implemented through a system called jails, as well as a userland utility plus, depending on the system, a number of other utilities. The functionality was committed into FreeBSD in 1999 by Poul-Henning Kamp after some period of production use by a hosting provider and was first released with FreeBSD 4.0, thus being supported on a number of FreeBSD descendants, including DragonFly BSD, to this day.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe need for the FreeBSD jails came from a small shared-environment hosting provider\u0027s (R\u0026amp;D Associates, Inc.\u0027s owner, Derrick T. Woolworth) desire to establish a clean, clear-cut separation between their own services and those of their customers, mainly for security and ease of administration (jail(8)). Instead of adding a new layer of fine-grained configuration options, the solution adopted by Poul-Henning Kamp was to compartmentalize the system \u2013 both its files and its resources \u2013 in such a way that only the right people are given access to the right compartments.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETopics covered in this course:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u0027Mastering Jails\u0027 course covers most of the Jails setup options available and required for running Jails in real live scenarios.

The LiveView programming model is mostly declarative: instead of saying \u0022when event ABC happens, change XYZ on the page\u0022, events in LiveView are managed by handlers bound to event id. Once the state changes, LiveView will re-render the relevant parts of its HTML template(calculate diff) and push it to the browser, which updates itself most efficiently. This means developers write LiveView templates as any other server-rendered HTML and LiveView does the hard work of tracking changes and sending the relevant diffs to the browser using websocket communication.

He\u0027s not simply some guy who\u0027s always liked to draw, got a microphone for Christmas and thought it\u0027d be cool to make a course. I regard myself as an exceptionally unexceptional draftsman but can already sense some improvement in the way I\u0027m tackling portraits.The value I\u0027ve already received leaves me with absolutely no complaints. You\u0027ll be getting A LOT of information from a guy who knows what he\u0027s doing with this course. And the demos - from blank sheet of paper to finished, fully rendered drawing - are both highly informative and inspirational. I\u0027m not sure you can ask for more than that from any instructor. It\u0027s a keeper. Many Thanks, Mr P for putting this together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u2013Sam Pollard\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf all the elements of drawing, portraiture is one of the most difficult to master. Practice alone is not enough to create portraits that come alive. That is the core value of this course. It provides a strong foundation for the individual to begin to master the creation of portraits of substance. This is not a course for the lazy. It requires patience and practice. But it will provide a roadmap that will allow the student to create fulfilling and satisfying portraits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u2013Stuart Givot\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn Excellent Course.

He provided some incredible insights into helping me improve my facial drawing skills. It\u0027s amazing of how easy and simple he teaches technique. I feel inspired and highly recommend his courses. I can\u0027t wait to learn more from him!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u2013Tuese Ahkiong\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is a clear, deep and well made course. Chris\u0027s sense of art teaching is excellent, it\u0027s like hanging out in his studio, looking over his shoulder (literally sometimes) and learning from following a professional. He talks out loud what goes on in his thoughts as he mindfully works his image. Seeing him work really helps me. His own career is used as an example, and I love all the personal stories that talk about his journey in the art world and specifically in this field of drawing portraits. The course is full of gold nuggets of info, stories, metaphors that help me put words and structure in my work. (I love the \u0022Valley of the Suck\u0022\u003Cstrong\u003E \u003C/strong\u003Econcept\u2013so true! ) This course really helped me to clarify my work in regards to values. Also, it helps to come back to those foundations of the underlying structure of the face. I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to build a strong foundation and seriously wants to get into portrait art. As it is in my case, I would recommend it as well to any professional that wants to come back and touch those foundations again, one tends to forget stuff!

In the beginning, we will have three projects. It doesn\u0027t sound like much, but they will give a fantastic idea of what is needed to basically understand how most of the plugins work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the first project, we will create a highly dynamic and fully customizable slideshow plugin. We will start with simple subjects such as directory structuring, methods of installing, deactivating, and uninstalling plugins. Then we will move on to intermediate topics such as CPT creation, the Metabox API (used to create custom fields), we will learn how to manipulate the database by adding and updating values in the metadata tables. We will learn how to control menus and submenus throughout the WordPress admin area.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso within this first project, we will learn to master APIs such as Settings, Options, and the Shortcode API. We will use everything we learn in this section to control the appearance and behavior of the slideshow on the frontend.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second project is a testimonial plugin. It looks simple, but the number of techniques that you will learn will surprise you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this project, we will review some subjects that you will have already seen in the previous section, and learn some new ones. We will learn a lot about the Widgets API and also how to control the HTML templates used in your plugin, including learning how to implement a simple template override system, which also includes learning how to create a specific theme_support for your plugin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe third project is the most complete and the most complex of the three. Have you ever needed to create custom tables for your plugin? Do you have any idea how some of the best-known plugins, like WooCommerce (just to name one of them), do to create and manage tables outside of the WordPress realms? Do you know why they do this, what are the advantages and disadvantages? No? Great, because you are going to learn that in this course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the third project, you will learn about the WordPress $wpdb class, the one responsible for managing all the custom table CRUD operations in your application. You will learn how to create tables, run queries, add, update, and remove data from those tables, using various APIs that you have learned to master during the course, such as the Metabox and Shortcode APIs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou will learn how to synchronize these actions so that your table works in tandem with the native WordPress tables. In addition, in this section, you will see how to provide a frontend interface where the site user can submit data, without having to access the WordPress admin. We will also see how to use WordPress\u0027 own user control system to manage user actions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWho is this course for?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI recommend this course for programmers, IT students, web developers, web designers, or any freelancer or professional who works with PHP, HTML, and CSS. It is recommended that you have notions of object-oriented PHP because all plugins created in the course are based on classes and objects. It is also important that you know how to use the main MySQL commands.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther than that, all professionals who want to learn how to create plugins are welcome. It is only necessary that you already have previous contact with WordPress and know how to install it on a local server at least.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHow is this course \u003Cem\u003Edifferent\u003C/em\u003E?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat my students like most is my excellent response time to their questions. You know, waiting too long can slow down your progress. So I always try to answer within 24 hours. You can be sure that you will never feel alone in this course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you have any doubts?

It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables.

This interaction is through the use of buttons and graphical icons which makes it visually appealing for users to use and the software behind the icons removes the robotic coding required to perform the particular task. The intention of the introduction of GUI is thought to reduce the commands that need to be typed at the command-line interface (CLI) through keyboard and that exactly what task it does!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow coming to Python GUI, let us say, for example, we would need to run a code in python, a .py file through the command line. We would create a simple GUI which might have a button \u201CRun\u201D and once a user clicks on that the python file which intends to run will automatically get selected and will run. What Python GUI would do essentially is remove the unnecessary coding part of running the python file through CLI. Not only this there are other plausible features Python GUI provides and that\u2019s exactly what you would go through in this course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring the training and post completion of the training, one would imbibe skills to take on more daring challenges in professional life. This course will also allow you to grasp the business intelligence required to be that handful of developers in Python GUI. This training will also give you a glimpse of the security concerns one faces in the real-world and, also allow you to think about how we can take care of those concerns. This Python GUI Course will also help you in getting the frame of mind to design the visual components and understand the temporal behavior of building the GUI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you complete the course you would b able to appreciate the enhancement of efficiency through the use of GUI, and the ease of use of the logical design of the program underlying in the design. With the completion of the course you would be able to bring in modularity in any GUI application you would build along with enhancing the usability perspective of GUI. This training is not restricted to just the theoretical part, but we enhance the use of theoretical concepts in the playground of real-life projects giving you an upper hand in establishing the relation of the concept and using them in real life. We ensure that no stone will be left unturned to make you the best python GUI developer organizations are looking for. Just choose a unit test framework that your organization would demand, a test runner, an IDE and we assure that you would be good to go in leaping in the professional world.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/python-gui-training-program-for-gui-development/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4719338_de52.jpg","duration":"3 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"6,343.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["The courses we conduct online never restricts the audience we expect to reach to.

The training program will help the trainee to perform all the statistical analysis with Minitab. It is also intended to make the trainees cover all the topics that fall under the domain of Minitab. Topics like Minitab GUI and Descriptive Statistics, Statistical Analysis using Minitab, Correlation Techniques in Minitab and Predictive Modeling using Excel will be covered in this training module and Project on Data Analytics using Minitab and Project on Minitab \u2013 Regression Modeling will be covered in the project module. The goal of this course is to help an individual to achieve knowledge of working with Minitab to perform time series analysis and forecasting of data in all sorts of statistics based problems. It will help all the interested trainees who are willing to extend their knowledge base concerned with Data analytics. This training will also assist the trainees to understand the sort of problems that could be resolved using this.

Let us start to understand what Minitab is. Minitab is a software used in use cases of statistics. Minitab, as the software is capable of data analysis, pattern detection through statistics, data crunching. Most of the calculation is automated, and graphs are generated as per the functionality required by the analyst working on the use cases. For this course specifically, we would be exploiting the use of Minitab for Time Series Analysis and Forecasting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, let us understand what time series analysis is. Time series data is a collection of data over some time or interval. The data when captured over time typically might have some internal structure, for example, autocorrelation, trends, seasonality, stationarity, and many such fundamentals. For example, let us think about the sales of umbrellas or raincoats. We can see that in the selling of these items we might encounter a seasonality aspect, that they might be sold high during the onset of the rainy season. Also, we can see that the data itself might auto-correlate itself to the promos that might have been set by some stores, online or offline, and many more such intricate detailing through the understanding of time series analysis fundamentals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow when we know how to analyze the time series it becomes pretty evident that what exactly to do with the studies or hypothesis we developed as a part of the study. The answer lies in prediction! We would understand the fundamentals through historical time series data and then utilize that deep insight to predict or forecast for the future. In this way, we would be able to capture the historical trends and seasonality and utilize them to have a better insight into what\u2019s in store in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis course is a collection of well-crafted tutorials or topics we would naturally go about if we must fully understand the topic of time series analysis and forecasting. This course will allow you to get a sense of what is lying in the basket of time series analysis in the professional project which you would encounter as soon as you take up the project in your organization. This course makes you reach that level of being the \u201Chandful\u201D of people who are capable of cracking even the toughest nut in the professional world.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis confidence you build in the course of this training will go a long way in not only analyzing the sense of time series data but also give you the capability to mentor people who would have just started their track on time series analysis. This course doesn\u2019t differentiate between a beginner or an advanced learner. We have to learn for everyone who is here to expand their horizon of knowledge.

The science of epigenetics has been scientifically proven give anyone the power to change the expressions of their genes. Genes can be altered by either the external environmental or internal mental and emotional signals without altering the gene sequence itself, the protocols in this book take a person through the step by step process of doing it.

The science of epigenetics has shown how they can be switched on or off, up regulated or downregulated. The natural wonder of our body is their creative and spontaneous functioning of each cell. Each time you implement the strategies in this book you will train your mind to direct your three brains to utilize neuroplasticity to build or reinforce their neural networks. This process now sends new signals to the receptors on each cell to direct their DNA to produce bio-substances to meet the body\u0027s needs for healing, adaptation, growth or development.
