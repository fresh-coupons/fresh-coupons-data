The G1 test is divided into two parts: 20 questions on road signs, and 20 questions on rules of the road. You must correctly answer 16 questions in each section to pass the test. In addition to the written exam, you will also need to pass a vision test and pay a $158.25 package fee, which will cover your knowledge test, eventual G2 driver\u2019s test, and your five-year license. If you need to retake the written exam, it will be an additional $15.75. The Ontario G1 driver\u2019s test is based on the 2021 Ontario Driver\u2019s Handbook and questions from the test will be pulled directly from the guide. Ontario has set in place a graduated driver\u2019s license (GDL) program that takes about two years to complete. After you pass your written test at Drive Test, you must hold your G1 license for one year, or 8 months if you are enrolled in a driver training program before you may take your first drive test to qualify for a G2 license. The G1 license will allow you to practice your driving skills under the supervision of a fully licensed driver.

Physics is one of the most fundamental scientific disciplines, and its main goal is to understand how the universe behaves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhysics is one of the oldest academic disciplines and, through its inclusion of astronomy, perhaps \u003Cem\u003Ethe\u003C/em\u003E oldest. Over much of the past two millennia, physics, chemistry, biology, and certain branches of mathematics were a part of natural philosophy, but during the Scientific Revolution in the 17th century these natural sciences emerged as unique research endeavors in their own right. Physics intersects with many interdisciplinary areas of research, such as biophysics and quantum chemistry, and the boundaries of physics are not rigidly defined. New ideas in physics often explain the fundamental mechanisms studied by other sciences and suggest new avenues of research in academic disciplines such as mathematics and philosophy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdvances in physics often enable advances in new technologies. For example, advances in the understanding of electromagnetism, solid-state physics, and nuclear physics led directly to the development of new products that have dramatically transformed modern-day society, such as television, computers, domestic appliances, and nuclear weapons; advances in thermodynamics led to the development of industrialization; and advances in mechanics inspired the development of calculus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EContemporary research in physics can be broadly divided into nuclear and particle physics; condensed matter physics; atomic, molecular, and optical physics; astrophysics; and applied physics.

It is sometimes called the central science because it provides a foundation for understanding both basic and applied scientific disciplines at a fundamental level. For example, chemistry explains aspects of plant chemistry (botany), the formation of igneous rocks (geology), how atmospheric ozone is formed and how environmental pollutants are degraded (ecology), the properties of the soil on the moon (cosmochemistry), how medications work (pharmacology), and how to collect DNA evidence at a crime scene (forensics).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChemistry addresses topics such as how atoms and molecules interact via chemical bonds to form new chemical compounds. There are two types of chemical bonds: 1. primary chemical bonds e.g covalent bonds, in which atoms share one or more electron(s); ionic bonds, in which an atom donates one or more electrons to another atom to produce ions (cations and anions); metallic bonds and 2. secondary chemical bonds e.g. hydrogen bonds; Van der Waals force bonds, ion-ion interaction, ion-dipole interaction etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"Ingl\u00EAs","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/school-chemistry-class-12-practical-tests-and-answers/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4575244_b901.jpg","duration":"425 questions","enrolledStudentsCount":"101 alunos","lastUpdated":"Publicado em 3/2022","targetAudiences":["Chemistry Lovers","School Students","Teachers","Fathers and mothers / Parents","Kids"],"tags":["Ensino e estudo acad\u00EAmico","Ci\u00EAncia"],"rating":null,"instructors":[{"name":"SMARTER ACADEMY","url":"/user/haytham-hesham-elsayed-hashem-elmousalami/","totalNumberOfStudents":181506,"totalNumberOfReviews":2223,"averageRating":4.232064823465704}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"3E39FDD430E181D9F7AD","originalPrice":"\u20B912,800","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-advanced-networking-test-pratique-2022/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4581810,"title":"AWS Advanced Networking test pratique [2022]","shortDescription":"Get your AWS Advanced Networking Certification from the first shot","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPreparing for AWS Certified Advanced Networking Specialty ANS-C00?\u003C/strong\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003EThis is\u003C/strong\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003ETHE practice exam course to give you the winning edge\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese practice exams have been co-authored by Stephane Maarek and Abhishek Singh who bring their collective experience of passing\u003Cstrong\u003E 20 AWS Certifications \u003C/strong\u003Eto the table.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe tone and tenor of the questions mimic the real exam.\u003C/strong\u003E Along with the \u003Cstrong\u003Edetailed description and \u201Cexam alert\u201D\u003C/strong\u003E provided within the explanations, we have also \u003Cstrong\u003Eextensively referenced AWS documentation\u003C/strong\u003E to get you up to speed on all domain areas being tested for the ANS-C00 exam.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWe want you to think of this course as the final pit-stop so that you can cross the winning line with absolute confidence and get AWS Certified!

There is no general consensus about its exact scope or epistemological status.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of mathematical activity consists of discovering and proving (by pure reasoning) properties of abstract objects. These objects are either abstractions from nature (such as natural numbers or lines), or (in modern mathematics) abstract entities of which certain properties, called axioms, are stipulated. A proof consists of a succession of applications of some deductive rules to already known results, including previously proved theorems, axioms and (in case of abstraction from nature) some basic properties that are considered as true starting points of the theory under consideration. The result of a proof is called a \u003Cem\u003Etheorem\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMathematics is widely used in science for modeling phenomena. This enables the extraction of quantitative predictions from experimental laws. For example, the movement of planets can be predicted with high accuracy using Newton\u0027s law of gravitation combined with mathematical computation. The independence of mathematical truth from any experimentation implies that the accuracy of such predictions depends only on the adequacy of the model for describing the reality. So when some inaccurate predictions arise, it means that the model must be improved or changed, not that the mathematics is wrong. For example, the perihelion precession of Mercury cannot be explained by Newton\u0027s law of gravitation, but is accurately explained by Einstein\u0027s general relativity. This experimental validation of Einstein\u0027s theory shows that Newton\u0027s law of gravitation is only an approximation (which still is very accurate in everyday life).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMathematics is essential in many fields, including natural sciences, engineering, medicine, finance, computer science and social sciences. Some areas of mathematics, such as statistics and game theory, are developed in direct correlation with their applications, and are often grouped under the name of applied mathematics. Other mathematical areas are developed independently from any application (and are therefore called pure mathematics), but practical applications are often discovered later. A fitting example is the problem of integer factorization, which goes back to Euclid, but which had no practical application before its use in the RSA cryptosystem (for the security of computer networks).\u003C/p\u003E","language":"Ingl\u00EAs","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/school-mathematics-math-class-10-practical-tests-and-answers/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4542780_cbca.jpg","duration":"183 questions","enrolledStudentsCount":"2.060 alunos","lastUpdated":"\u00DAltima atualiza\u00E7\u00E3o em 2/2022","targetAudiences":["Students of 10 class","Teachers","Fathers and mothers / Parents","Kids"],"tags":["Ensino e estudo acad\u00EAmico","Matem\u00E1tica","Matem\u00E1tica"],"rating":{"count":2,"averageValue":"4.6"},"instructors":[{"name":"SMARTER ACADEMY","url":"/user/haytham-hesham-elsayed-hashem-elmousalami/","totalNumberOfStudents":181506,"totalNumberOfReviews":2223,"averageRating":4.232064823465704}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"2F54594334EC6A2232D8","originalPrice":"\u20B912,800","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/istq52-foundation-level-practice-test-ctfl-200-questions/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4508518,"title":"ISTQB Foundation Level Practice Test (CTFL) \u002B200 Questions","shortDescription":"The best way to be a software certified tester by having timed practice exams organized by chapter wise.","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeing ISTQB Foundation Level ( CTFL) Certified \u003Cstrong\u003Ecould\u003C/strong\u003E increase your chance to get a software teste position, could help you to get promotion, and will emphasis you to go to next levels of ISTQB Certification.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow you are asking yourself, How to prepare and pass the ISTQB Foundation level exam?

It was applied to re-implementing the kernel of the Unix operating system. During the 1980s, C gradually gained popularity. It has become one of the most widely used programming languages, with C compilers from various vendors available for the majority of existing computer architectures and operating systems. C has been standardized by ANSI since 1989 (ANSI C) and by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EC is an imperative procedural language. It was designed to be compiled to provide low-level access to memory and language constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions, all with minimal runtime support.

It was introduced by American engineer Bill Smith while working at Motorola in 1986. A six sigma process is one in which 99.99966% of all opportunities to produce some feature of a part are statistically expected to be free of defects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESix Sigma strategies seek to improve manufacturing quality by identifying and removing the causes of defects and minimizing variability in manufacturing and business processes. It does this by using empirical and statistical quality management methods and by hiring people who serve as Six Sigma experts. Each Six Sigma project follows a defined methodology and has specific value targets, such as reducing pollution or increasing customer satisfaction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe term \u003Cem\u003ESix Sigma\u003C/em\u003E originates from statistical modeling of manufacturing processes. The maturity of a manufacturing process can be described by a \u003Cem\u003Esigma\u003C/em\u003E rating indicating its yield or the percentage of defect-free products it creates\u2014specifically, to within how many standard deviations of a normal distribution the fraction of defect-free outcomes corresponds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHistory\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMotorola pioneered Six Sigma, setting a \u0022six sigma\u0022 goal for its manufacturing business. It registered Six Sigma as a service mark on June 11, 1991 U.S. Service Mark 1,647,704; on December 28, 1993, it registered Six Sigma as a trademark. In 2005 Motorola attributed over $17 billion in savings to Six Sigma.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHoneywell and General Electric were also early adopters of Six Sigma. As GE\u0027s CEO, in 1995 Jack Welch made it central to his business strategy, and in 1998 it announced $350 million in cost savings thanks to Six Sigma, which was an important factor in the spread of Six Sigma (this figure later grew to more than $1 billion). By the late 1990s, about two-thirds of the Fortune 500 organizations had begun Six Sigma initiatives with the aim of reducing costs and improving quality.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn recent years, some practitioners have combined Six Sigma ideas with lean manufacturing to create a methodology named Lean Six Sigma. The Lean Six Sigma methodology views lean manufacturing, which addresses process flow and waste issues, and Six Sigma, with its focus on variation and design, as complementary disciplines aimed at promoting \u0022business and operational excellence\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn 2011, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has published the first standard \u0022ISO 13053:2011\u0022 defining a Six Sigma process.

There is no general consensus about its exact scope or epistemological status.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of mathematical activity consists of discovering and proving (by pure reasoning) properties of abstract objects. These objects are either abstractions from nature (such as natural numbers or lines), or (in modern mathematics) abstract entities of which certain properties, called axioms, are stipulated. A proof consists of a succession of applications of some deductive rules to already known results, including previously proved theorems, axioms and (in case of abstraction from nature) some basic properties that are considered as true starting points of the theory under consideration. The result of a proof is called a \u003Cem\u003Etheorem\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMathematics is widely used in science for modeling phenomena. This enables the extraction of quantitative predictions from experimental laws. For example, the movement of planets can be predicted with high accuracy using Newton\u0027s law of gravitation combined with mathematical computation. The independence of mathematical truth from any experimentation implies that the accuracy of such predictions depends only on the adequacy of the model for describing the reality. So when some inaccurate predictions arise, it means that the model must be improved or changed, not that the mathematics is wrong. For example, the perihelion precession of Mercury cannot be explained by Newton\u0027s law of gravitation, but is accurately explained by Einstein\u0027s general relativity. This experimental validation of Einstein\u0027s theory shows that Newton\u0027s law of gravitation is only an approximation (which still is very accurate in everyday life).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMathematics is essential in many fields, including natural sciences, engineering, medicine, finance, computer science and social sciences. Some areas of mathematics, such as statistics and game theory, are developed in direct correlation with their applications, and are often grouped under the name of applied mathematics. Other mathematical areas are developed independently from any application (and are therefore called pure mathematics), but practical applications are often discovered later. A fitting example is the problem of integer factorization, which goes back to Euclid, but which had no practical application before its use in the RSA cryptosystem (for the security of computer networks).\u003C/p\u003E","language":"Ingl\u00EAs","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/mathematics-math-class-9-practical-tests-and-answers/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4539922_cc1f.jpg","duration":"199 questions","enrolledStudentsCount":"2.107 alunos","lastUpdated":"\u00DAltima atualiza\u00E7\u00E3o em 2/2022","targetAudiences":["Students of 9 class","Teachers","Fathers and mothers / Parents","Kids"],"tags":["Ensino e estudo acad\u00EAmico","Matem\u00E1tica","Matem\u00E1tica"],"rating":null,"instructors":[{"name":"SMARTER ACADEMY","url":"/user/haytham-hesham-elsayed-hashem-elmousalami/","totalNumberOfStudents":181506,"totalNumberOfReviews":2223,"averageRating":4.232064823465704}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"D79CCF44BF9690118E01","originalPrice":"\u20B912,800","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/pmi-scheduling-professional-pmi-sp-be-pro-planner/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":3931598,"title":"2022 PMI Scheduling Professional (PMI-SP) Be PRO Planner","shortDescription":"Get Ready to be PMI Scheduling Professional (PMI-SP) based on American project management institute PMI","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPMI Scheduling Professional (PMI-SP) Be PRO Planner\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGet Ready to be PMI Scheduling Professional (PMI-SP) based on American project management institute PMI\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Project Management Institute (\u003Cstrong\u003EPMI\u003C/strong\u003E) \u00AE offers a professional credential for project schedulers, known as the \u003Cstrong\u003EPMI\u003C/strong\u003E Scheduling Professional (\u003Cstrong\u003EPMI\u003C/strong\u003E-\u003Cstrong\u003ESP\u003C/strong\u003E)\u00AE. \u003Cstrong\u003EPMI\u0027s\u003C/strong\u003E professional credentialing examination development processes stand apart from other project management certification examination development practices.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo be \u003Cstrong\u003Equalified\u003C/strong\u003E for this \u003Cstrong\u003Ecertification\u003C/strong\u003E, you need to have a four-year \u003Cstrong\u003Edegree\u003C/strong\u003E and 3,500 hours of project \u003Cstrong\u003Escheduling\u003C/strong\u003E experience, which is around 2 years of experience.

The certifications are developed and maintained through a vigorous process. The certification program includes: Certified Associate in Project Management(CAPM)\u00AE certification PMI Agile Certified Practitioner (PMI-ACP)\u00AE certification PMI Risk Management Professional(PMI-RMP)\u00AEcertification PMI Scheduling Professional(PMI-SP)\u00AEcertification Portfolio Management Professional (PfMP) \u00AE certification Program Management Professional (PgMP)\u00AE certification Project Management Professional(PMP)\u00AE certification PMI Professional in Business Analysis (PMI-PBA)\u00AE certification PMI\u2019s certifications are distinguished by their global development and application, which makes them transferable across industries and geographic borders. The strength of PMI\u2019s certifications is that they are portable and not tied to any single method, standard or organization. PMI\u2019s certification program is designed to ensure that all certification holders have demonstrated their competence through fair and valid measures. Steps are taken to ensure only the most reliable testing measures are used in the assessment of candidates. For example, interviews can be influenced by how difficult the interviewer tends to be, how well the candidate is performing that day, and even how many questions the interviewer asks along the same line of questioning. PMI certifications are also developed by project management practitioners for practitioners. The certification program is driven by the thousands of certification holders who volunteer to spend time constructing and refining the exam questions used by PMI. These volunteers represent the diversity of PMI\u2019s market, coming from every region of the world, industry, job level and experience level. The exam questions are monitored through industry-standard statistical procedures, also overseen by volunteers. PMI understands the importance of impartiality in carrying out its certification activities, manages conflict of interest and ensures the objectivity of its certification activities. A candidate is assessed by examining his or her competence using: Education and Experience \u2013 A combination of education and/or experience in project management is required for each certification. For example, the PMP requires both training specifically in project management and experience in the role of a project manager by leading and directing project teams, while delivering project results. Testing Competence \u2013 The candidate is required to apply project management concepts and experience to potential on-the-job situations through a series of scenario-based questions. Ongoing Development \u2013 Maintenance of a PMI certification requires the accumulation of ongoing professional development and education or, in some cases, recertification.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"Ingl\u00E9s","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/pmi-scheduling-professional-pmi-sp-be-pro-planner/","imageUri":"https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/3931598_7938.jpg?secure=VA-KxieNWD9hwX9NyAuMug%3D%3D%2C1646604874","duration":"100 questions","enrolledStudentsCount":"9.085 estudiantes","lastUpdated":"Fecha de la \u00FAltima actualizaci\u00F3n: 6/2021","targetAudiences":["schedulers and planners","Project Managers and IT managers","Project Engineers","Project Coordinators","Technical office employees and engineers","Project Coordinators"],"tags":["Negocios","Gesti\u00F3n de proyectos","PMI-SP"],"rating":{"count":16,"averageValue":"3.6"},"instructors":[{"name":"SMARTER ACADEMY","url":"/user/haytham-hesham-elsayed-hashem-elmousalami/","totalNumberOfStudents":181506,"totalNumberOfReviews":2223,"averageRating":4.232064823465704}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"EF548DE115E24D078598","originalPrice":"\u20B912,800","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/pmp-agile-exam-prep-2021/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4079278,"title":"PMP Certification Agile Practice Guide 2021 Course; PMP Prep","shortDescription":"Understand critical concepts from the Agile Practice Guide that\u0027ll help you succeed in the PMP certification exam 2021","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EIn this \u003Cstrong\u003EAgile Practice Guide 2021\u003C/strong\u003E course for the \u003Cstrong\u003EPMP certification\u003C/strong\u003E, I cover all the critical aspects required to pass the PMP certification exam in the first try.

There is no general consensus about its exact scope or epistemological status.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of mathematical activity consists of discovering and proving (by pure reasoning) properties of abstract objects. These objects are either abstractions from nature (such as natural numbers or lines), or (in modern mathematics) abstract entities of which certain properties, called axioms, are stipulated. A proof consists of a succession of applications of some deductive rules to already known results, including previously proved theorems, axioms and (in case of abstraction from nature) some basic properties that are considered as true starting points of the theory under consideration. The result of a proof is called a \u003Cem\u003Etheorem\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMathematics is widely used in science for modeling phenomena. This enables the extraction of quantitative predictions from experimental laws. For example, the movement of planets can be predicted with high accuracy using Newton\u0027s law of gravitation combined with mathematical computation. The independence of mathematical truth from any experimentation implies that the accuracy of such predictions depends only on the adequacy of the model for describing the reality. So when some inaccurate predictions arise, it means that the model must be improved or changed, not that the mathematics is wrong. For example, the perihelion precession of Mercury cannot be explained by Newton\u0027s law of gravitation, but is accurately explained by Einstein\u0027s general relativity. This experimental validation of Einstein\u0027s theory shows that Newton\u0027s law of gravitation is only an approximation (which still is very accurate in everyday life).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMathematics is essential in many fields, including natural sciences, engineering, medicine, finance, computer science and social sciences. Some areas of mathematics, such as statistics and game theory, are developed in direct correlation with their applications, and are often grouped under the name of applied mathematics. Other mathematical areas are developed independently from any application (and are therefore called pure mathematics), but practical applications are often discovered later. A fitting example is the problem of integer factorization, which goes back to Euclid, but which had no practical application before its use in the RSA cryptosystem (for the security of computer networks).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"Ingl\u00EAs","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/mathematics-math-class-8-practical-tests-and-answers/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4536714_169f.jpg","duration":"255 questions","enrolledStudentsCount":"2.793 alunos","lastUpdated":"\u00DAltima atualiza\u00E7\u00E3o em 2/2022","targetAudiences":["Students of 8 class","Teachers","Fathers and mothers / Parents","Kids"],"tags":["Ensino e estudo acad\u00EAmico","Matem\u00E1tica","Matem\u00E1tica"],"rating":null,"instructors":[{"name":"SMARTER ACADEMY","url":"/user/haytham-hesham-elsayed-hashem-elmousalami/","totalNumberOfStudents":181506,"totalNumberOfReviews":2223,"averageRating":4.232064823465704}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"0063879D006A09017D53","originalPrice":"12.800\u00A0INR","discountedPrice":"Gratis","expirationText":"4 d\u00EDas","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/setup-a-virtual-web-server-using-linode-or-digital-ocean/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":2444066,"title":"Setup a Virtual Web Server using Linode or Digital Ocean","shortDescription":"Deploy, Configure, and Scale a Production Virtual Web Server on Linode or Digital Ocean.

It is sometimes called the central science because it provides a foundation for understanding both basic and applied scientific disciplines at a fundamental level. For example, chemistry explains aspects of plant chemistry (botany), the formation of igneous rocks (geology), how atmospheric ozone is formed and how environmental pollutants are degraded (ecology), the properties of the soil on the moon (cosmochemistry), how medications work (pharmacology), and how to collect DNA evidence at a crime scene (forensics).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChemistry addresses topics such as how atoms and molecules interact via chemical bonds to form new chemical compounds. There are two types of chemical bonds: 1. primary chemical bonds e.g covalent bonds, in which atoms share one or more electron(s); ionic bonds, in which an atom donates one or more electrons to another atom to produce ions (cations and anions); metallic bonds and 2. secondary chemical bonds e.g. hydrogen bonds; Van der Waals force bonds, ion-ion interaction, ion-dipole interaction etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"Ingl\u00E9s","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/school-chemistry-class-11-practical-tests-and-answers/","imageUri":"https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4564488_07ec.jpg?secure=q5sfzx12AB7tkA16XS5EOQ%3D%3D%2C1646604713","duration":"381 questions","enrolledStudentsCount":"662 estudiantes","lastUpdated":"Fecha de la \u00FAltima actualizaci\u00F3n: 3/2022","targetAudiences":["Chemistry Lovers","School Students","Teachers","Fathers and mothers / Parents","Kids"],"tags":["Ense\u00F1anzas y disciplinas acad\u00E9micas","Ciencia","Qu\u00EDmica"],"rating":null,"instructors":[{"name":"SMARTER ACADEMY","url":"/user/haytham-hesham-elsayed-hashem-elmousalami/","totalNumberOfStudents":181506,"totalNumberOfReviews":2223,"averageRating":4.232064823465704}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"A16D2A460454E3425CC2","originalPrice":"12.800\u00A0INR","discountedPrice":"Gratis","expirationText":"4 d\u00EDas","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/rookie-coders/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4551580,"title":"Software engineering fundamentals for Beginners","shortDescription":"Building a career in a dynamic industry like software is far more challenging than it seems.

Physics is one of the most fundamental scientific disciplines, and its main goal is to understand how the universe behaves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhysics is one of the oldest academic disciplines and, through its inclusion of astronomy, perhaps \u003Cem\u003Ethe\u003C/em\u003E oldest. Over much of the past two millennia, physics, chemistry, biology, and certain branches of mathematics were a part of natural philosophy, but during the Scientific Revolution in the 17th century these natural sciences emerged as unique research endeavors in their own right. Physics intersects with many interdisciplinary areas of research, such as biophysics and quantum chemistry, and the boundaries of physics are not rigidly defined. New ideas in physics often explain the fundamental mechanisms studied by other sciences and suggest new avenues of research in academic disciplines such as mathematics and philosophy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdvances in physics often enable advances in new technologies. For example, advances in the understanding of electromagnetism, solid-state physics, and nuclear physics led directly to the development of new products that have dramatically transformed modern-day society, such as television, computers, domestic appliances, and nuclear weapons; advances in thermodynamics led to the development of industrialization; and advances in mechanics inspired the development of calculus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EContemporary research in physics can be broadly divided into nuclear and particle physics; condensed matter physics; atomic, molecular, and optical physics; astrophysics; and applied physics.

There is no general consensus about its exact scope or epistemological status.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of mathematical activity consists of discovering and proving (by pure reasoning) properties of abstract objects. These objects are either abstractions from nature (such as natural numbers or lines), or (in modern mathematics) abstract entities of which certain properties, called axioms, are stipulated. A proof consists of a succession of applications of some deductive rules to already known results, including previously proved theorems, axioms and (in case of abstraction from nature) some basic properties that are considered as true starting points of the theory under consideration. The result of a proof is called a \u003Cem\u003Etheorem\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMathematics is widely used in science for modeling phenomena. This enables the extraction of quantitative predictions from experimental laws. For example, the movement of planets can be predicted with high accuracy using Newton\u0027s law of gravitation combined with mathematical computation. The independence of mathematical truth from any experimentation implies that the accuracy of such predictions depends only on the adequacy of the model for describing the reality. So when some inaccurate predictions arise, it means that the model must be improved or changed, not that the mathematics is wrong. For example, the perihelion precession of Mercury cannot be explained by Newton\u0027s law of gravitation, but is accurately explained by Einstein\u0027s general relativity. This experimental validation of Einstein\u0027s theory shows that Newton\u0027s law of gravitation is only an approximation (which still is very accurate in everyday life).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMathematics is essential in many fields, including natural sciences, engineering, medicine, finance, computer science and social sciences. Some areas of mathematics, such as statistics and game theory, are developed in direct correlation with their applications, and are often grouped under the name of applied mathematics. Other mathematical areas are developed independently from any application (and are therefore called pure mathematics), but practical applications are often discovered later. A fitting example is the problem of integer factorization, which goes back to Euclid, but which had no practical application before its use in the RSA cryptosystem (for the security of computer networks).\u003C/p\u003E","language":"Ingl\u00E9s","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/school-mathematics-math-class-11-practical-tests-and-answers/","imageUri":"https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4546176_a238.jpg?secure=yQVsHH8F6pSFJ6Sn27bpbA%3D%3D%2C1646605167","duration":"240 questions","enrolledStudentsCount":"2.001 estudiantes","lastUpdated":"Fecha de la \u00FAltima actualizaci\u00F3n: 2/2022","targetAudiences":["Math Lovers","Teachers","Students of 11 Class","Fathers and mothers / Parents","Kids"],"tags":["Ense\u00F1anzas y disciplinas acad\u00E9micas","Matem\u00E1ticas","Matem\u00E1ticas"],"rating":null,"instructors":[{"name":"SMARTER ACADEMY","url":"/user/haytham-hesham-elsayed-hashem-elmousalami/","totalNumberOfStudents":181506,"totalNumberOfReviews":2223,"averageRating":4.232064823465704}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"3A52BE68D2384288DAE6","originalPrice":"12.800\u00A0INR","discountedPrice":"Gratis","expirationText":"4 d\u00EDas","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/financial-awareness-for-students-and-professionals/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4101876,"title":"Personal Finance fundamentals for beginners","shortDescription":"Fundamentals of necessary financial tools like loans, equities from a day to day personal finance perspective.","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EWe keep hearing about financial terms all the time in the news, in conversations, and in almost every kind of media that reaches us.
