It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E*\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E javascript course contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript introduction\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript array\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript variables\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript functions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript objects\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript control statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003Esection 4- learn PHP\u0026nbsp;programming language\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis section will learn the basic structure of a web application and how a web browser interacts with a web server.

By drawing comparisons with Excel, our aim is to give you an intuitive understanding of these cycles, their interrelationships within the accounting environment, and how they mirror manual data input in Excel\u0027s journal entry format.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs we venture into the second half of the course, our emphasis shifts to practical applications. This segment is structured around a comprehensive problem, wherein we simulate two months of data input in QuickBooks Online, mirroring each transaction in an Excel accounting worksheet. This experiential learning method offers a hands-on experience of the nuances of accounting processes. You will delve into transaction entries, adjustments, and closing entries in both QuickBooks Online and Excel, in addition to performing bank reconciliations - a critical task for any accountant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the end of this course, you\u0027ll be well-versed in the operational aspects of QuickBooks Online Accounting Software and understand how it compares against manual data input processes in Excel. More importantly, you will possess the skills to use both platforms effectively for diverse accounting tasks, positioning you strongly for handling real-world accounting scenarios.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis course goes beyond imparting knowledge; it is about gaining hands-on experience, understanding the rationale behind the processes, and empowering you to maximize the potential of these powerful accounting tools.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re ready to delve into the world of accounting software, unravel the complexities of transactions, and explore the intricacies of QuickBooks Online and Excel, this course is just a click away.
