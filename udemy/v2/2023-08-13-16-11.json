The term digital forensics was originally used as a synonym for \u003Cstrong\u003Ecomputer forensics\u003C/strong\u003E but has expanded to cover investigation of all devices capable of storing digital data. With roots in the personal computing revolution of the late 1970s and early 1980s, the discipline evolved in a haphazard manner during the 1990s, and it was not until the early 21st century that national policies emerged.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDigital forensics investigations have a variety of applications. The most common is to support or refute a hypothesis before criminal or civil courts. Criminal cases involve the alleged breaking of laws that are defined by legislation and that are enforced by the police and prosecuted by the state, such as theft and assault against the person. Civil cases on the other hand deal with protecting the rights and property of individuals (often associated with family disputes) but may also be concerned with contractual disputes between commercial entities where a form of digital forensics referred to as electronic discovery (discovery) may be involved\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring the 1980s very few specialized digital forensic tools existed, and consequently investigators often performed live analysis on media, examining computers from within the operating system using existing sysadmin tools to extract evidence. This practice carried the risk of modifying data on the disk, either inadvertently or otherwise, which led to claims of evidence tampering. A number of tools were created during the early 1990s to address the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDigital forensics is commonly used in both criminal law and private investigation. Traditionally it has been associated with criminal law, where evidence is collected to support or oppose a hypothesis before the courts. As with other areas of forensics this is often a part of a wider investigation spanning a number of disciplines. In some cases, the collected evidence is used as a form of intelligence gathering, used for other purposes than court proceedings (for example to locate, identify or halt other crimes). As a result, intelligence gathering is sometimes held to a less strict forensic standard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you enroll in our Digital Forensics Masterclass | Forensic Science 2023 DFMC, you\u0027ll not only learn about the fundamentals of digital forensics, but so much more!

This is a project based course where you will learn step by step on how to build a news channel and to create news videos with fully animated and super realistic AI powered news anchors. This course will give you a whole new perspective about how artificial intelligence is more than capable of revolutionising journalism. In addition, you will also be amazed by how far AI can automate news videos creation by speeding up the editing process as well as replacing human news anchors with a hyper realistic artificial intelligence powered news anchor as the substitution which can be very useful for independent journalist who want to keep their identity secret due to privacy or safety reasons. In the introduction session, you will learn several aspects where AI can be utilised to create news videos, such as converting news scripts to audio and producing animated news anchors to present the news. Then, you will continue by getting to know several news sources like Google News, AP News, and Reuters as well as learning how to check the potential bias and reliability of the news. This part is very crucial to make sure the news you are planning to cover are actually factual. Afterward, you will get to know several news topic ideas that you should consider and it is really recommended for you just to pick one and concentrate on that one topic. Once you have chosen your news topic, we will enter the main part of the course where you will be guided step by step on how to create and edit news video from scratch using AI tools like HeyGen, HourOne, and Paradiso AI. Those tools will enable you to convert text to audio as well as to integrate the audio with the fully animated news anchors. Once the video has been created and ready to be uploaded, we will go over comprehensive analysis on which social media platform that you should be uploading to. In that section, we will be mainly focusing on Youtube and Tiktok since those two platforms have the most audience and also the best options for video based contents. Last but not least, at the end of the course, you will learn several different ways to monetise your news channel and how to potentially turn this side hustle into a sustainable media business.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, before getting into the course, we need to ask this question to ourselves: why should we build a news channel? Well, if you were asking this question five or ten years ago, at that time, there had not been a lot of independent journalist yet and most of journalists work for media companies, nonetheless, the situation is totally different nowadays, as the rise of independent journalism in the past few years, more and more news channels are created on social media platforms like Youtube and Tiktok. Therefore, anybody can be an independent journalist nowadays and it is very possible to combine it with content creation. The advancement of artificial intelligence technologies in the past couple years also contributed very significantly where today you can even create news channels and upload videos where you are reporting news without showing your face since you can replace it with AI powered news anchors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow are things that you can expect to learn from the course:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to automate news videos creation process using AI\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to analyse and check if the news is unbiased, neutral, accurate, and factual\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to convert news articles from Google News, AP News, and Reuters into news scripts using ChatGPT\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to customise AI powered news anchors avatars\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to create a hyper realistic news videos with AI powered news anchor using HeyGen\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to create a hyper realistic news videos with AI powered news anchor using HourOne\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to create a hyper realistic news videos with AI powered news anchor using Paradiso AI\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to create breaking news intro using Canva\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to add subtitles automatically and edit news videos using Veed IO\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFull comprehensive analysis on which social media platform is the best to host your content videos: comparing Yotube vs Tiktok\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn several different strategies to monetise news videos and how to potentially turn this side hustle into a news channel business\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/automating-journalism-make-news-channel-with-ai-news-anchor/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5489852_b307.jpg","duration":"2.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"399.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Journalists who are interested to use AI to automate their news content creation process","People who are interested in starting a news channel or news agency"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":0,"averageValue":"0.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"Christ Raharja","url":"/user/christ-raharja/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":0}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"599C1794466BC765765E","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"3 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/cca-131-cloudera-certified-hadoop-and-spark-administrator/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":2171124,"title":"Practical Guide to setup Hadoop and Spark Cluster using CDH","shortDescription":"Step by step instructions to setup Hadoop and Spark Cluster using Cloudera Distribution of Hadoop (Formerly CCA 131)","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003ECloudera is one of the leading vendor for distributions related to Hadoop and Spark.
