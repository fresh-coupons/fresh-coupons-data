Are you stuck in tutorial hell? want to build your own CV but don\u0027t know how and when to start? If so, this is the right project for you. This course contains five projects for a reason. It covers the most common parts of every web project out there. Even if you are experienced as a developer, you should still give it a shot. and the projects are not similar and that\u0027s the surprise. Every project covers a certain topic.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EFirst of all, we are going to start with probably what every web project has which is the authentication system. It contains a couple of useful parts like validation, password hashing, sessions, and so on. And for the second project, we are going to take a look at the crud app which will help you manipulate data like a pro, set forms, update, delete and create data. The third project is all about building a URL shortening service and that\u0027s pretty simple and yet very practical. We are going to use a bit of Jquery on the way. For the fourth project, which is the largest one of them all, where we are going to integrate our code from the past project (auth system) and we are going to insert images and display them nicely. And that only leaves us with only one project, and that is the email sender that\u0027s one of the most important parts of any kind of development because it will teach you to send emails dynamically. And that\u0027s actually it.
