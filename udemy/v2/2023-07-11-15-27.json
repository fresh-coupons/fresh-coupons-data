This course is a follow-up from the earlier course on \u003Cstrong\u003EReverse Engineering \u0026amp; Memory Hacking\u003C/strong\u003E. It is the practical application of what you have learnt in the first course. If you think that packing and anti-debugging is good enough to prevent reverse engineering, then you may be in for a surprise. In this course, I\u0026nbsp;will show you how to test the effectiveness of several popular packers by packing crackmes and then reversing them - \u003Cstrong\u003Ewithout unpacking. \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETraditionally packed programs are unpacked before debugging is carried out. This is because a packed program\u0027s file cannot be patched. Much of software protection has centered on making it difficult to unpack programs. However,\u0026nbsp; the important question is: how effective is packing, obfuscation and anti-debugging as a means to prevent reversing? This course explores several packers to find the answers. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe will do the analysis using a tool called Cheat Engine, which is a prominent tool used by game hackers. This tool could also be used to study and analyze packed program\u0027s processes that is running in memory. You will learn how to perform debugging in spite of anti-debugging being implemented. There is no need to unpack and dump memory.\u0026nbsp; Instead of unpacking and then patching the dumped files and fixing IAT (Import Address Table) tables,\u0026nbsp; we will write scripts to hack memory using byte patching using an advanced technique called AOB (Array-Of-Bytes) Injection, by injecting code into code caves (inline memory patching).\u0026nbsp; In this course you will learn how to do all of the above and more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the end of this course you will be able to gauge the effectiveness of software packers, obfuscation and anti-debugging protection and also to have a good idea of how to implement extra countermeasures to improve the security of software.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn all the practical exercises and walkthroughs, we will use Crackme\u0027s which I\u0026nbsp;have written.

It assumes that you\u0027re new to the language, so it gets you started with basic functionality such as creating functions, creating variables, and calling these lines of code from your standard HTML pages. It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E*\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E javascript course contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript introduction\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript array\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript variables\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript functions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript objects\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript control statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript cookies\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript loop statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript data structures\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript error handling\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript regular expressions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003Esection 3- learn PHP\u0026nbsp;programming language\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this section, we will learn the basic structure of a web application, and how a web browser interacts with a web server.

Does it impact your life and your money? Well, all that I would say is, \u201CIf you can\u2019t negotiate effectively with people, you shouldn\u2019t buy/sell anything for more than a few dollars.\u201D\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason I say this is because regardless of the type of work we do, knowing how to negotiate effectively can greatly impact our success and our satisfaction. Wondering how? I will tell you how\u2026 but before that let me remind you how often you negotiate in life. From childhood, you must have practiced the art of negotiation \u2013 Bedtime, a treat, a promotion, a raise, an extended deadline. Yet you are not good at negotiations. Why? Does it demand a different level of intellect and expertise? Well, I will say \u201CNo\u201D to the former and \u201CYes\u201D to the latter. There are some techniques and a process when put into practice enable you to save thousands of dollars, but unfortunately, no one has told you about these techniques yet, and hence, you are missing out. And by this time, I am sure you must have figured out what I am doing here. I am here to help you uncover all these techniques in this course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt may be\u2026or may not be difficult for you to digest the fact that we all negotiate on a daily basis. On a personal level, we negotiate with friends, family, landlords, car sellers, and employers, among others. We come across hundreds of situations that put our negotiation skills to the test. Whether buying a house or car, reviewing your salary with your boss, or deliberating contracts for your business, your success in each of\u003Cstrong\u003E \u003C/strong\u003Ethese activities will be heavily dependent on your ability to negotiate. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut how come I am speaking so highly of negotiation skills? Well, I\u0027ve spent thousands of hours reading books, articles, and videos and doing real-life research aiming to master negotiation conversations. And now, I want my learnings to benefit you so that you don\u2019t need to chart the long road which I have trodden. I want my long road to be your shortcut and hence, I have created a \u003Cstrong\u003E7-step model \u201CN.E.U.R.O Negotiation System\u003C/strong\u003E\u201D. Combining the principles of Evolution and Brain Science, this program demystifies the science of negotiation like nothing else. This course will help you prepare for and conduct real-world negotiations, from personal to professional, small to large, and daily to extraordinary. You won\u2019t be able to find anything else even one-hundredth as valuable and jaw-dropping. If you get it, please feel free to revert to me.

Drawing on the latest research and best practices across a breadth of industries, the course goes far beyond simplistic formulas such as \u0022win-win\u0022 and \u0022win-lose.\u0022 Instead, it provides hard-hitting, practical, intensive, and transformative techniques.

This Microcontroller is called\u0026nbsp;DigiSpark.\u0026nbsp;It is a microcontroller\u0026nbsp;based on the Attiny85 development board.

An Expert hacker with a few minutes, photographic memory,\u0026nbsp; and perfect typing accuracy can use a few well-crafted keystrokes to hack virtually anything they have physical access to. However, the proper hardware can do the same thing every time on demand without fail.\u0026nbsp; That\u2019s where the Rubber Ducky and other Human Interface Devices (HID)\u0026nbsp; come into play.

Keyboards announce themselves to computers as HID devices and are in turn automatically recognized and accepted. We\u0027ll program a microcontroller in Arduino to take advantage of this by acting as an HID device. We can then create scripts that run when the device is plugged into a target computer.

Additionally, students learn to automate nearly anything on an unattended device which can be extremely useful when you need to run the same commands on a series of computers.\u0026nbsp; That\u2019s how the Original USB Ruber Ducky was invented. Hak5 founder\u0026nbsp; Darren Kitchen, while working as a sysadmin, got tired of typing the same commands to fix printers and network shares, again and again, and the device evolved out of laziness.

It is responsible for coordinating the execution of the entire Spark application. The driver program defines the SparkContext, which serves as the entry point for Spark functionality. It handles the division of the application into tasks, scheduling them on the cluster, and managing the overall execution. The driver communicates with the cluster manager to allocate resources and coordinate the distribution of tasks to worker nodes. It also maintains control and monitoring of the application.
