To run a business at optimal capacity, you need to reduce or eliminate waste from processes and improve production flow. In this course, you\u0027ll learn about Lean strategies to reduce waste by determining which operations add value and which don\u0027t. You\u0027ll explore the concept of continuous flow, and discover how to balance work processes to make production flow more efficient.

And in any business, one of the heaviest drains on profitability is waste. Lean waste can come in the form of time, material, and labor. But it may also be related to the utilization of skill-sets as well as poor planning. In lean manufacturing, waste is any expense or effort that is expended but which does not transform raw materials into an item the customer is willing to pay for. By optimizing process steps and eliminating waste, the only true value is added at each phase of production.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday, the Lean Manufacturing model recognizes 8 types of waste within an operation; seven originally conceived when the Toyota Production System was first conceived, and an eighth added when the lean methodology was adopted within the Western World.

The good news is there is another way to quickly and effectively learn a second language.\u00A0 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00A0 \t\u00A0 You usually hear people saying that they can understand a lot more than they can speak. Do you know why? Well, language is a skill and not information. The only way you can develop a skill is by practicing and in this case that means repetition. You can be presented with information in form of grammar or explanations of sentence patterns and you can learn it, but that\u00A0 is only awareness, now you can recognize phrases or pattern or word sequences, but you cannot produce. The only way to develop your conversational skills is overlearning, i.e., repeating patterns until they are embedded into your subconscious mind.\u00A0 Repetition is the key to become fluent in a second language and that is what this course is about: to make you a fluent Spanish speaker\u00A0 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00A0 \t\u00A0 We keep the grammar at the lowest level and focus on over-learning. We will teach you how to become fluent in Spanish in no time.\u00A0 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00A0 \t\u00A0 Remember that to speak like a native doesn\u2019t mean to sound like a native but to think like a native. A native doesn\u2019t need to think about what they need to say, they think about how to achieve their communication goals and they don\u2019t need to think about which words to use, that is subconscious. That is the main objective of the course, to make you think like a native Spanish speaker.\u00A0 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00A0 \t\u00A0 This one is the first part of a series of courses that we will release in the near future.\u00A0 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00A0 \t\u00A0 The course is divided into 5 sections:\u00A0 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00A0 \t\u00A0 1.Spanish pronunciation\u00A0 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00A0 \t\u00A0 2.Basic grammar\u00A0 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00A0 \t\u00A0 3.Spanish irregular verbs\u00A0 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00A0 \t\u00A0 4.Basic sentences and useful phrases\u00A0 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00A0 \t\u00A0 5.Basic dialog with repetition-, substitution- and response drills.\u00A0 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00A0 \tIf you are in any of the following situations, then this course is definitely for you:\u00A0 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00A0 \t- You need to learn to communicate in Spanish in no time to boost your professional career.\u00A0 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00A0 \t- You are learning Spanish but you don\u2019t make progress with your communication skills.\u00A0 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00A0 \t- You are about to give up your Spanish course, you are frustrated\u00A0 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00A0 \t- You are about to move to a Spanish-speaking country and want to quickly learn to communicate in Spanish.\u00A0 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00A0 \t- You have learnt Spanish at a certain level but now you are in a Spanish-speaking country and don\u2019t survive conversations.\u00A0 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00A0 \t- You just want to learn to communicate in Spanish to have fun and enhance your culture and horizons.\u00A0 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00A0 \t- You need an effective roadmap to learn to communicate in Spanish.\u00A0 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00A0 \t\u00A0 If you decide to take this course you will receive more than 25 years of experience learning and teaching foreign languages (Spanish, English,\u00A0Dutch,\u00A0German, Italian, Russian), surviving in multicultural environments and using the language skills to boost my professional career.
