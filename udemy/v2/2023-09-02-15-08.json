Time series data is a collection of data over some time or interval. The data when captured over time typically might have some internal structure, for example, autocorrelation, trends, seasonality, stationarity, and many such fundamentals. For example, let us think about the sales of umbrellas or raincoats. We can see that in the selling of these items we might encounter a seasonality aspect, that they might be sold high during the onset of the rainy season. Also, we can see that the data itself might auto-correlate itself to the promos that might have been set by some stores, online or offline, and many more such intricate detailing through the understanding of time series analysis fundamentals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow when we know how to analyze the time series it becomes pretty evident that what exactly to do with the studies or hypothesis we developed as a part of the study.

Two fundamental principles of Islamic banking are the sharing of profit and loss and the prohibition of the collection and payment of interest by lenders and investors. In Islamic banking, the banks do not collect interests from creditors. Instead, they earn money using equity participation systems and share profits and losses. Islamic finance is practiced in many Muslim countries and is extremely popular among Islamic communities, as some conventional banking practices might be against Shariah. Islamic finance is considered more ethical than conventional banking, as it believes that a bank and its clients should make profits and losses together. Hence, it does not just focus on maximizing the bank\u2019s wealth. Also, Islamic finance practices consider the best interests of the Muslim community.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIslamic banking development can be attributed to some conventional banking theories and practices which go against and hurt the sentiments of the Muslim communities. Hence, Islamic finance was developed by inventing methods that are Sharia-compliant. Sharia is the Islamic law present in the Quran\u2019s teachings. Creating practices that align with the Muslim culture and beliefs encourages many to take up banking. Islamic finance is so strictly followed that banks look to religious leaders and scholars for guidance. The main objective of Islamic banking\u003Cstrong\u003E \u003C/strong\u003Eand finance is that all society participants should create wealth and benefit.

Even if you\u2019re just looking to build profile, you need a strong internet presence, if you want people to know you exist. The purpose of Digital Marketing is to raise awareness, connect with people who are interested in what you\u2019re offering, and persuade them to take actions you want. It uses digital forms of communication, like the web, smartphones, social media platforms, and search engines, as a medium to reach potential customers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust like traditional marketing, digital marketing is about finding prospective customers and broadcasting your message to them in the right place, in the right tone, and at the right time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDigital Marketing has one major advantage over traditional marketing, as you can use analytics tools to monitor your campaigns in real time, so you can swiftly adjust your approach. Typically, it would cost more and take longer to make these kinds of adjustments, but with Digital Marketing it\u2019s easier to course correct than it would be if you\u2019d invested in a print ad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat is Social Media?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESocial Media is an umbrella term to describe online platforms focused on community-based communication, such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Platforms like this use content sharing and post interaction, and most content is produced from the users, not the owners of the platform. Social media also includes curation sites such as Wikis, as well as professional networking platforms like LinkedIn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDue to the massive reach of Social Media, good social media marketing skills are now \u003Cem\u003Eessential \u003C/em\u003Efor anyone looking to attract the maximum number of customers online.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat is SEO?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESEO, or Search engine optimization, is the science of attracting specific types of traffic to a website, using a search engine. To master SEO, you need to create high-value content with high authority backlinks, and include keywords in that content that your ideal customers search for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESEO is never a one size fits all solution. To be successful, you must take a bespoke approach. That means you need to optimise your site for the type of search engine you want it to rank highly on, like Google, Amazon, or Bing. SEO typically focuses on scoring highly organic search results, not paid or sponsored traffic. You can also use it in paid ads, to maximise their reach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs search engines attempt to give the most suitable answer to each person\u2019s search query, you must ensure a search engine views your site as the most appropriate match.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEvery search engine uses a different algorithm to determine what the best result to a search query is. This will include a combination of different factors, including the quality of your content and backlinks, how many visitors your site has, and your website\u2019s speed and uptime.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModern SEO is complex, and mastering it takes more than just getting the right meta tags. It includes understanding how rich snippets, video, and featured snippets work to enhance your rankings, as well as the importance of voice search and Video SEO. If you want to be successful using Google Search, you also need to understand how Google Rank Brain scores your website and must optimise your site to score highly on Google\u2019s algorithm.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat is Local SEO?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELocal SEO is also becoming more critical, and you will need to learn the basics of this, especially since nearly half of all Google searches now have a local intent. Near Me searches have grown even faster, exploding at a rate of 150% more than local searches alone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMastering SEO includes understanding Technical SEO, which focuses on priming your website for crawling and indexing by search engines. It\u2019s important you don\u2019t neglect this aspect, as without it search engines will find it difficult to access, crawl, and index your website. As a result, you\u2019ll rank much lower. The reason this process is referred to as \u201CTechnical SEO\u201D is because it has nothing to do with promoting your website, and is not the same as the type of SEO you include in your content.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat types of careers will this course help you with?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you complete this course, you\u2019ll be a Digital Marketing Master, and will have many different career options open to you. You could work as a freelance Facebook Ads \u0026amp; Instagram Ads consultant, market brands, or promote your own business. Your options will be almost unlimited, as strong digital marketing skills are \u003Cem\u003Ehighly \u003C/em\u003Ein demand.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs they focus on online business, and can be done entirely online, Digital Marketing jobs are also pandemic proof, so your skillset will always be needed. Just make sure to narrow down your choices and focus on what you enjoy and do well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe you have a passion for branding, and would like to work as a branding consultant for start-up companies? Perhaps you\u2019re interested in specialising, whether that be in marketing for the tech sector, the health and wellness niche, or in real estate?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best way to achieve top earnings is to find a niche you can position yourself as an authority voice in, and you can do this by acquiring a skillset your competitors don\u2019t have. If you can offer expertise in Facebook advertising, or email marketing, for example, you will be bringing something extra to the table that will give you an edge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving niche knowledge will mark you out from other candidates trying to land their first gig and signal that you\u2019re a high value candidate to employers and clients.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also specialise by diversifying into niche careers such as SEO or copywriting. SEO knowledge is a highly in demand skill and it doesn\u2019t require a qualification. If you know how to do it right, copywriting can be similarly rewarding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause of the amount of online content we consume, demand for skilled SEO experts and pro copywriters has grown massively. More brands than ever require well-written content, that\u2019s optimised to perform well in search. If you can combine the two, you\u2019ll have a HUGE competitive advantage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you\u2019re getting started, you can try freelance sites, like Elance or People per Hour, although it will take a little while to build up a reputation. Blogging can be another area you can build up a following in and then monetize, though to do well you must post regularly, and provide unique content.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWebsite design skills, which you will learn on this course, are another great way to make money. You can gain practical experience by creating sites for your family and friends for free, or in exchange for their skills. Practical experience is essential when you\u2019re first starting out and will stand you in great stead as you progress in your mastery.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you become more confident and have built up your portfolio, you\u2019ll be able to land paid clients. You can use your knowledge to create professional looking WordPress sites for local or online brands \u2013 without needing coding skills, or any upfront investment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECourse Learning Format\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe\u2019ve optimised our learning structure to help you take in as much information as quickly as possible, using a three-tier approach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, we introduce you to a subject by covering the basics, helping you to get a good overview of the topic in question.

After this, we are going to build a comments system and this will be the biggest project in this course. We will begin first by doing a post system and then we will grab comments for every post that we have of course we will use Ajax-JQuery for inserting, deleting, and showing comments. after that, we will integrate a rating system into the previous two projects to make a bigger project. So, I will show how to download a JQuery plugin, how to integrate it and how to use it to do the rating system for every post, and so on. And the rating system is going to be implemented of course using Ajax-JQuery. The upcoming project is going to be also created with Ajax and JQuery and that\u0027s a live search system and we will combine it with our big project.

In this class, we will dive into the world of Data Structures and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using the popular programming language, C\u002B\u002B.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EData structures are an essential part of computer science, as they provide an organized way of storing and manipulating data. By using data structures, we can access and modify data more efficiently, which is essential for developing efficient and effective software.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn our class, we will cover various data structures, including arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and trees. We will explore how to implement these structures in C\u002B\u002B and how to perform basic operations like insertion, deletion, and searching. Additionally, we will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each data structure and when to use them in different situations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELinked lists, for example, are a popular data structure used to store and manage data in a sequence. Linked lists are efficient because they can be dynamically allocated and are flexible in size. However, they can be more complicated to implement and use than other data structures like arrays.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStacks and queues are also important data structures that are commonly used in software development. Stacks use the \u0022last in, first out\u0022 (LIFO) principle, while queues use the \u0022first in, first out\u0022 (FIFO) principle. These data structures are useful for managing data in a specific order, and we will learn how to implement and use them in our class.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrees are another popular data structure that we will cover in our class. Trees are useful for organizing data in a hierarchical structure and are often used in computer science applications like file systems, databases, and search engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to data structures, we will also cover the basics of OOP in C\u002B\u002B. Object-oriented programming focuses on encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. With OOP, we can create reusable code, improve code organization and structure, and make code maintenance more manageable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn our class, we will cover the basics of OOP in C\u002B\u002B, including classes, objects, constructors, and destructors.
