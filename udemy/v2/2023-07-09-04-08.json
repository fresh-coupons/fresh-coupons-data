The term digital forensics was originally used as a synonym for \u003Cstrong\u003Ecomputer forensics\u003C/strong\u003E but has expanded to cover investigation of all devices capable of storing digital data. With roots in the personal computing revolution of the late 1970s and early 1980s, the discipline evolved in a haphazard manner during the 1990s, and it was not until the early 21st century that national policies emerged.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDigital forensics investigations have a variety of applications. The most common is to support or refute a hypothesis before criminal or civil courts. Criminal cases involve the alleged breaking of laws that are defined by legislation and that are enforced by the police and prosecuted by the state, such as theft and assault against the person. Civil cases on the other hand deal with protecting the rights and property of individuals (often associated with family disputes) but may also be concerned with contractual disputes between commercial entities where a form of digital forensics referred to as electronic discovery (discovery) may be involved\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring the 1980s very few specialized digital forensic tools existed, and consequently investigators often performed live analysis on media, examining computers from within the operating system using existing sysadmin tools to extract evidence. This practice carried the risk of modifying data on the disk, either inadvertently or otherwise, which led to claims of evidence tampering. A number of tools were created during the early 1990s to address the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDigital forensics is commonly used in both criminal law and private investigation. Traditionally it has been associated with criminal law, where evidence is collected to support or oppose a hypothesis before the courts. As with other areas of forensics this is often a part of a wider investigation spanning a number of disciplines. In some cases, the collected evidence is used as a form of intelligence gathering, used for other purposes than court proceedings (for example to locate, identify or halt other crimes). As a result, intelligence gathering is sometimes held to a less strict forensic standard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you enroll in our Digital Forensics Masterclass | Forensic Science 2023 DFMC, you\u0027ll not only learn about the fundamentals of digital forensics, but so much more!

There is almost no criminal activity that does not involve digital evidence, and it is your responsibility as an investigator to gather all available evidence, process it, and present your findings to the authorities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInvestigators who work in the field of digital forensics must have a diverse set of skills and interests. The first question I ask anyone thinking about a career in this field is if they enjoy solving puzzles. You may not have access to any information other than the fact that something happened when investigating a case. So, if someone needs to be shown or told what happened, this field may not be right for them. When a case is brought to an investigator\u0027s attention, the investigator is often given instructions to figure out what the computer or device was used for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother important trait is the ability to deal with frustration, as investigative tools and software do not always work without problems. When it comes to cell phones and small devices, this is a fairly common occurrence. Many students, rather than working through the challenges, stop their investigation in class at the first sign of difficulty. They don\u0027t even try to figure out what\u0027s wrong with the tool by looking at the web or using the help system. To be a successful investigator, one must be persistent and creative \u2013 they must be problem solvers. Digital forensics is a branch of forensic science that collects, analyses, documents, and presents digital evidence related to computer crime for use in a court of law using scientific knowledge. Knowing what was done, when it was done, and who did it is the ultimate goal. The term \u201Cdigital forensics\u201D is often used interchangeably with \u201Ccomputer forensics\u201D (also known as \u201Ccyber forensics\u201D), but it has come to encompass all devices capable of storing digital data, including networking devices, mobile phones, tablets, digital cameras, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, digital home appliances, and other digital storage media such as CD/DVD, USB drives, SD cards, external drives, and backup tapes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComputer Forensics is a specialization that deals with the recovery, examination and investigation of digital evidence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComputer Forensics is an applied science that deals with the recovery, examination and investigation of digital evidence. It is an applied science that is used in both civil and criminal investigations to provide answers to questions such as: what happened? how did it happen? who did it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis section will explore the basics of Computer Forensics.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/computer-forensics-beginner-to-advanced-cfct-masterclass/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4594072_04c0_3.jpg","duration":"6.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"46,084.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Beginner Computer Forensics Investigators"],"tags":["Computer Forensics"],"rating":{"count":264,"averageValue":"4.1"},"instructors":[{"name":"OCSALY Academy | 220.000\u002B Students","url":"/user/online-academy-of-computer-science/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.24359}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"CFIR_COURSE_2023","originalPrice":"\u20B92,299","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/how-to-identify-fake-news-and-fight-misinformation/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4151998,"title":"How To Identify Fake News and Fight Misinformation","shortDescription":"Critical Thinking Skills and Strategy","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAbout This Class\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep-By-Step Strategy to help you identify fake news and misinformation by using the methods of Critical Thinking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to navigate the abundance of information around you and how to become a socially engaged Critical Thinking advocate that helps make the world we live in a more reliable shared environment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat You Will Learn\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00B7 The difference between Fake News, Misinformation, and Disinformation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00B7 The main types of misinformation and their effects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00B7 Why smart people are not immune to misinformation and manipulation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00B7 The main characteristics of a Critical Thinker\u2019s Mindset.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00B7 How to analyze the context of a news segment or claim.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00B7 How to analyze the source of a news segment or claim.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00B7 How to analyze the credentials for the author of a news segment or claim.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00B7 How to analyze the main claim included in a news segment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe abundance of information makes identifying fake news and fighting misinformation, an essential skill in navigating the world we live in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeing able to tell the fake from the real, the sensational from the relevant, and the manipulation from genuine interest, become reliable tools in our decision-making processes and ultimately, shape the way we build our own life and the society we live in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnroll in this course and discover new ways to optimize your critical thinking strategies and skills.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/how-to-identify-fake-news-and-fight-misinformation/","imageUri":"https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4151998_2073_4.jpg","duration":"30 total mins","enrolledStudentsCount":"4,788.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["All individuals interested in learning new ways to optimize their Critical Thinking strategies and skills."],"tags":["Assertiveness","Critical Thinking"],"rating":{"count":43,"averageValue":"4.3"},"instructors":[{"name":"Lucia Grosaru, M.A. Psy.","url":"/user/lucia-grosaru/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.55}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"JULY2023","originalPrice":"\u20B91,299","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"5 hours","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/google-analytics-certification-how-to-pass-the-exam/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4724096,"title":"Google Analytics Certification.

The goal of computer forensics is to perform a structured investigation and maintain a documented chain of evidence to find out exactly what happened on a computing device and who was responsible for it. Computer forensics -- which is sometimes referred to as computer forensic science essentially is data recovery with legal compliance guidelines to make the information admissible in legal proceedings. The terms digital forensics and cyber forensics are often used as synonyms for computer forensics. Digital forensics starts with the collection of information in a way that maintains its integrity. Investigators then analyze the data or system to determine if it was changed, how it was changed and who made the changes. The use of computer forensics isn\u0027t always tied to a crime.

Arabic grammar can be tough and intimidating, but it doesn\u2019t have to be. Grammar here means the important words that give structure to a sentence, in addition to the structures themselves. In linguistics, we call such words \u0022function words\u0022. When you know these words, you\u2019ll be able to recognize them and use them easily to understand and build simple sentences. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe course focuses on Modern Standard Arabic, which is the variety of Arabic that is used for formal and written settings. So this is what you need if you\u2019re interested in learning Arabic to read books, follow the news, work with business and financial documents, and so forth. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe start from very simple phrases and sentences, and gradually go towards more sentence complexity. With 14 topics of basic Arabic grammar, and more than 80 grammar words (function words), as well as many exercises, you will be able to cover a wide variety of sentences. In this course, we use the Champolu Method, which presents language learning in a structured, contrastive and colorful way, in line with the concept of \u0022Comprehensible Input\u0022.

However, it is my belief that anyone could use their expertise to create online platforms, for making their models into codes, and codes into user-friendly interfaces.\u0026nbsp; See an amazing discussion I\u0026nbsp;did with Dr Jonathan Karr \u0022Innovating with biomathematics | In Conversation with Jonathan Karr\u0022 on our YouTube channel\u0026nbsp; \u0022Theoretical and Mathematical Biology\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn this course, I use an example for my most recent research period to make a point: \u003Cstrong\u003Euser-friendly interface is imperative for making mathematical models available properly to the medical and biological sciences\u003C/strong\u003E.\u0026nbsp; One of my concerns was JavaScript being powerful enough, it is!

The resources managed in logistics can include physical items such as food, materials, animals, equipment, and liquids, as well as abstract items, such as time and information.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe logistics of physical items usually involves the integration of information flow, material handling, production, packaging, inventory, transportation, and warehousing. There is often confusion over the difference between logistics and supply chains.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is now generally accepted that logistics refers to activities within one company/organization related to the distribution of a product, whereas supply chain also encompasses manufacturing and procurement and therefore has a much broader focus, as it involves multiple enterprises, including suppliers, manufacturers, and retailers, working together to meet a customer\u2019s need for a product or service.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESupply Chain Management\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esupply chain management is the process of managing the movement of the raw materials and parts from the beginning of production through delivery to the consumer.

You will Learn from the best Business and Make Profit !","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EThere\u2019s a HUGE difference between simply operating a used car dealership business and operating a profitable used car dealership. To get a better idea of the possible demand for used cars in your area, you\u2019ll need to crunch some numbers. By knowing the number of used cars sold in your area every year and month , you can estimate what percentage of the market you will be likely to be able to corner and reach. By locating the average profit per vehicle, you can get an approximate idea of how much profit and money your dealership able to make per year. While the groundwork associated with opening a dealership can be time-consuming, expensive, and demanding, the real test of your dealership\u2019s viability doesn\u2019t begin until after you open your doors to the public. Without the right management of your dealership, all the effort you put into laying the foundation will be wasted. While each state has its own rules and regulations, there are several important universal aspects of operating a car dealership and tips on how you can get the most out of your investment. Your customers are the single most important factor in the success or failure of your business, so taking the time to identify who they are and what they care about is absolutely vital. Take a look at the types of cars you plan on selling, then do some research to determine the age, gender, and income level of the average individual who owns those types of vehicles. Later down the line, this will allow you to tailor your marketing and advertising efforts toward those who are most likely to be interested in what you have to offer. Make sure to base any of your conclusions regarding your target clients on real actionable data; don\u2019t simply make assumptions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/car-flipping-earn-money-from-selling-used-cars-ocsaly/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4741312_7b69_3.jpg","duration":"1.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"24,277.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Beginner Used Car Business Leaders"],"tags":["Car Flipping"],"rating":{"count":79,"averageValue":"4.1"},"instructors":[{"name":"OCSALY Academy | 220.000\u002B Students","url":"/user/online-academy-of-computer-science/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.1}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"CAR_SELL_2023","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-developer-associate-practice-exams-new/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4698444,"title":"AWS Certified Developer Associate Practice Exams","shortDescription":"AWS Certified Developer Associate | Practice Exams for AWS Certified Developer Associate","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EEmbark on your journey to ace the \u003Cstrong\u003EAWS Certified Developer Associate (DVA-C02)\u003C/strong\u003E exam with the robust practice test course.

At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E*\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E javascript course contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript introduction\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript array\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript variables\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript functions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript objects\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript control statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript cookies\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript loop statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript data structures\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript error handling\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript regular expressions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003Esection 3- learn PHP\u0026nbsp;programming language\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this section, we will learn the basic structure of a web application, and how a web browser interacts with a web server.

There is a BIG difference in the way these two types of results are ranked. With organic search results, there are many more ranking factors that you will need to consider if you want to perform well in search. When it comes to paid results, advertisers are ranked according to the amount they\u2019ll pay a single visitor, sent to them through Google\u2019s Pay Per Click Ad\u2019s network.

You can\u2019t pay your way to the top. Instead, you need to optimise your site, pages, and content so you score highly in Google\u2019s ranking algorithm. The good news is, when people search for information on a topic, most people trust organic search results FAR more than they trust paid results.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this video, we\u2019ll be focusing solely on organic results, and giving you tips and advice you can use to perform well in organic Google search.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy do you need SEO?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch engines will be one of the main sources of traffic to your webpage and Google is the biggest and most popular search engine, by far.

This is basically an extensive project based course where you will be fully guided step by step on how to start a successful Etsy print on demand business from scratch. This course will be a comprehensive business roadmap where you will learn how to sell a backpack, phone case, watch, wireless charger, and pillow from Printify, learn how to use Leonardo AI to generate very cool designs which will be added to those Printify base products. In the introduction session, you will learn the basic fundamentals of Etsy marketplace and how print on demand business model works, then continued by learning how to find reliable and high quality suppliers by understanding few important aspects that your suppliers need to have, afterward, you will also learn how to conduct market research by evaluating several different factors that you need to pay very close attention to, such as pricing strategies, market trend, profit margin, customer preferences, target customers. In addition, we will also learn how to use tools like Insight factory and Roketfy to do more extensive market and product research especially to analyze competitor\u2019s sales data within our niche. Then, entering the main part, you will learn how to utilize AI text to image generators like Leonardo AI to create very creative designs and patterns. Once the designs have been created, then you will learn step by step on how to set up your Etsy and Prinfify stores. After that, the most fun but also at the same time the most challenging part is to add the designs that you already generated using Leonardo AI to backpack, phone case, watch, wireless charger, and pillow products on Printify. After adding the design to those products, we will continue by integrating our Printify store with our Etsy store. Lastly, at the end of the course, you will learn several effective marketing strategies that you can implement to increase your sales. Not only that, you will also learn step by step on how to run ad campaigns to potentially reach broader potential customers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, before getting into the course, we need to ask this question, why should we learn and start Etsy print on demand business? Has it not been oversaturated in the past couple years? Well the answer to that question is actually pretty simple.

This course contains modules that educate the human resource professional on career development opportunities for the employees and helps them to design the progress framework.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe real asset of a company is not its infrastructure nor it is the profits, it is its employees who work wholeheartedly for the company. The companies, who understand this thing well, never get into higher losses. So the essence is that every company should try to make its employees happy all the while. Now if we talk about the performance part of the employees, so it also matters a lot for the company and yes it is not exaggerated to say that employees should also feel the responsibility of work. So to make employees motivated toward work there is a concept of \u201Cperformance appraisal\u201D in every company which is basically the allowance, paid to the employee whose performance is excellent in every assignment provided to him. So this is basically linked directly to the performance of the employee.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHiring new employees is one thing and retaining the new as well as the existing employees is also pivotal.

Turnover is highly reinvigorating and refreshing, but too much turnover can cause a brain drain, and naturally, that\u2019s not good for the company\u2019s health. Advice keeps the balance straight and tries every bid to keep the turnover less than 15 percent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou will often come across people, who are just not settling in at one workplace, and in their search for another temporary job, they end up giving you an interview for a particular post. The chances are that they might have all the qualifications required and all the right criteria you have been looking for, but if he is a job hopper, you should let go of him and find another person for the job at your firm. Hiring somebody for the short term is both hectic and shortsighted since the person might leave anytime, and you will have to work on looking for a new employee again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe will start with a brief introduction to human resource and its presence in an organization.

However, they can be more complicated to implement and use than other data structures like arrays.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStacks and queues are also important data structures that are commonly used in software development. Stacks use the \u0022last in, first out\u0022 (LIFO) principle, while queues use the \u0022first in, first out\u0022 (FIFO) principle. These data structures are useful for managing data in a specific order, and we will learn how to implement and use them in our class.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrees are another popular data structure that we will cover in our class. Trees are useful for organizing data in a hierarchical structure and are often used in computer science applications like file systems, databases, and search engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to data structures, we will also cover the basics of OOP in C\u002B\u002B. Object-oriented programming focuses on encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. With OOP, we can create reusable code, improve code organization and structure, and make code maintenance more manageable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn our class, we will cover the basics of OOP in C\u002B\u002B, including classes, objects, constructors, and destructors. We will also discuss inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation, and how they can be used to improve the functionality of our programs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EC\u002B\u002B is a powerful programming language known for its speed and efficiency. It is widely used in developing operating systems, embedded systems, and gaming applications. With C\u002B\u002B, we can take advantage of its powerful features to create complex programs with high performance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn our class, we will explore the C\u002B\u002B syntax and how it can be used to implement data structures and OOP concepts. We will also learn how to optimize our code for performance and efficiency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo wrap it up, our CS104, C105 Masterclass will provide you with a solid foundation in Data Structures and Object-Oriented Programming with C\u002B\u002B. You will learn how to implement data structures, use OOP concepts to improve your code, and take advantage of the powerful features of C\u002B\u002B.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/data-structures-cpp/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5160672_2d22.jpg","duration":"8.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"15,009.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["This course is ideal for individuals who want to enhance their programming skills with C\u002B\u002B and learn the fundamentals of data structures and OOP.","Aspiring computer science students who want to get a head start in their coursework or professionals who wish to expand their knowledge of programming will benefit from this course.","Students who have a basic understanding of C\u002B\u002B but want to learn advanced techniques and concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction should take this course.","Students who have a basic understanding of C\u002B\u002B but want to learn advanced techniques and concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction should take this course.","Programmers who want to learn how to design efficient algorithms and optimize code will find this course valuable.","This course is also suitable for individuals who are interested in pursuing a career in software development, particularly in industries such as gaming, mobile app development, and finance."],"tags":["Data Structures"],"rating":{"count":61,"averageValue":"4.6"},"instructors":[{"name":"OCSALY Academy | 220.000\u002B Students","url":"/user/online-academy-of-computer-science/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.55}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"CS104_DATA_2023_TOP","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"\u20B9449","expirationText":"5 hours","discountPercentage":44}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/automotive-essentials/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":3055678,"title":"\u0627\u0633\u0627\u0633\u064A\u0627\u062A \u0647\u0646\u062F\u0633\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u064A\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062A - AUTOMOTIVE ESSENTIALS","shortDescription":"\u0645\u0646 \u062E\u0644\u0627\u0644 \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0648\u0631\u0633 \u0647\u062A\u0642\u062F\u0631  \u062A\u0627\u0633\u0633 \u0646\u0641\u0633\u0643 \u0641\u064A \u0645\u062C\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u064A\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062A ,\u0647\u0630\u0629 \u0627\u0648\u0644 \u062E\u0637\u0648\u0629 \u0648 \u0627\u0647\u0645 \u062E\u0637\u0648\u0629","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp;
