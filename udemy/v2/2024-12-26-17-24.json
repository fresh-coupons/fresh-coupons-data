Epithelium, connective tissue, muscle tissue, and nervous tissue have commonalities but look very distinct structurally after staining. Each stain exists to highlight an important feature or component within a tissue type. For example, one of the most common stains, Hematoxylin, is a basic dye that stains proteins a blue color, while Eosin stains proteins a pink color. These two stains are commonly used together to define intracellular organelles and proteins. Because of the variety of the proteins that exist, some stains were created to highlight a particular protein, which this review will discuss in the following sections. The benefit of using a special stain is that it can highlight the specific protein very well. However, because of its specificity, the other structures will not be seen. For this reason, multiple slides will often be created from a given specimen so that multiple stains can be performed to gather the full range of needed information.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlmost all tissue stains are performed on tissue that has been removed from the body. However, in rare instances, very specialize stains called vital stains can work on tissue remaining in the body. These stains are used for the identification of specific types of tissue and identification of abnormal tissue, so a subsequent biopsy can be more accurate in obtaining abnormal tissue\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETissue Preparation\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore specific staining can occur, tissue samples must undergo preparation through the following stages: Fixation, processing, embedding, sectioning, and sometimes antigen retrieval. In modern histology laboratories, most of these steps are automated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E.\u003Cstrong\u003EFixation: \u003C/strong\u003EFixation uses chemicals to preserve the structure of the tissue in its natural form and protects it from degradation by irreversibly cross-linking proteins. Although several specialized fixatives are available, Neutral Buffered Formalin is a common choice for this step. The fixation step is vital to the rest of the histologic staining procedure because by retaining the chemical composition of the tissue, the sample is hardened and makes the sectioning phase easier. Paraffin-formalin is another effective fixative. Its benefit is that it is the fixative of choice for immunostaining; however, it requires preparation at the time of the fixation. Bouin is a fixative used for examining embryo and brain tissue because of its superior preservation of delicate nuclei and glycogen. Its downside is that it does not preserve kidney tissues well and also distorts mitochondrial structure.[1]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDehydration: \u003C/strong\u003EThe addition of ethanol accomplishes the dehydration of a sample. It removed water from the sample and further hardens the tissue for eventual light microscopy. After ethanol is applied, and following the completion of tissue dehydration, xylene is used to remove the ethanol.[1]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEmbedding: \u003C/strong\u003EEmbedding is the process of putting the sample into a paraffin wax or a plastic resin to enhance the process of extracting cellular structures. This step is to be performed with caution if the goal is to perform immunostaining because the paraffin wax will inhibit the penetration of antibodies, and lead to a false result.[1]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESectioning: \u003C/strong\u003ESectioning involves mounting the specimen on a microtome and cutting it into sections. The preferred thickness is 4-5 micrometers so that it can be stained and put on a microscope slide for examination.[1]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAntigen Retrieval: \u003C/strong\u003EThis step is to retrieve antigens that could have been covered in the fixation and embedding stages. If the cross-linking of proteins conceals the antigen sites, there may not be as robust of an immunohistochemical response. Antigen retrieval is achieved through heating and proteolytic methods to break down the cross-links and reveal the epitopes and antigens that were previously covered.[1] Although this step carries the risk of denaturing both the fixative and the antigens themselves, a successful antigen retrieval method can lead to a much more effective immunostaining intensity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/histology-step-by-step/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5080670_193b.jpg","duration":"1.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"3,980.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Medical students, science students ,nursing students ,medical protectional"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":9,"averageValue":"4.5"},"instructors":[{"name":"Mohamed AL ashram","url":"/user/mohamed-taha-288/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.5555553}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"31E997297BFB075A0724","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"3 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/rest-apis-development-with-java-api-crud-operation/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":6065101,"title":"REST APIs Development With Java - API CRUD Operation","shortDescription":"Best course for fresher to understand basic concept and upgrade there skills : REST APIs Development in Java.

It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E*\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E javascript course contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript introduction\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript array\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript variables\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript functions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript objects\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript control statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript cookies\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript loop statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript data structures\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript error handling\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript regular expressions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003Esection 3- learn PHP\u0026nbsp;programming language\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this section, we will learn the basic structure of a web application, and how a web browser interacts with a web server.

Biology\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBiology is the study of life. While biologists have made great strides in discovering things on Earth, there are still many new things to learn. The first fundamental questions are: What is Life? What does it mean to have life? These inquiries are essential to the discoveries that biologists find every day. With such a vast scope of information, biologists must organize these discoveries that will stand the test of time. In this unit, we introduce the major topics that biologists study and the theories they use and apply to their work\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EBasic Chemistry\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENature is not based on one field of study. It incorporates biology, physics, chemistry, and other academic disciplines. Life is multidisciplinary and is driven by chemical processes. Since so many biology topics overlap with basic principles of chemistry, you need a basic understanding and appreciation of chemistry to fully understand biology. For example, in Unit 1, we discussed that the atom is the first part of the biological hierarchy. In this unit, we provide an understanding of this foundational level of organization.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBiological Molecules\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBiological molecules are the essential molecules needed for life. These molecules can be organic or inorganic. Organic chemistry is the study of carbon, which is an element that forms strong covalent bonds essential for the foundational structures of all living things. Water, salts, acids, and bases are mostly essential inorganic molecules that facilitate many biological processes. All organisms contain organic biological molecules \u2013 carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and nucleic acid \u2013 that are essential to life. This unit will help you understand the structures and functions of these organic molecules and how our body needs them to function properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003ECells and Cell Membranes\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECells are the smallest units of life. In this unit, we explore the characteristics, components, and functions of cells. Learning about the structures of cells allows us to see the similarities and differences among organisms. Bacteria, plant, animal, and fungus cells are similar in many ways and contain many of the same small structures known as organelles. However, some characteristics help distinguish whether a cell belongs to an animal, plant, fungus, or bacteria. For example, all plant cells contain cell walls, while animal cells lack this particular extracellular structure. The water within a cell that presses against the cell wall gives a plant its rigidity and your celery its crunch!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eclassification\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClassification is a fundamental concept in biology. It\u0027s the process of grouping organisms based on their shared characteristics. This helps scientists understand the relationships between different organisms and how life has evolved over time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are different hierarchical levels of classification, from the broadest (kingdom) to the most specific (species). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EMetabolism, Enzymes, and Cellular Respiration\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMetabolism refers to the sum total of every chemical reaction in every organism. Cells use enzymes and metabolic pathways to conduct these chemical reactions. It is essential to understand the reactions that comprise metabolism to learn how organisms acquire and use energy to survive. Since this process is quite complicated, we will explore it from several different angles in this unit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EPhotosynthesis\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave you ever wondered how a plant grows from a tiny acorn into a giant oak tree? Where does all that biomass come from? How does it get the energy to grow? Photosynthesis is the fascinating process plants use to convert light energy to chemical energy. Because plants are at the bottom of the food pyramid in almost all ecological systems, understanding how they grow and develop will give you a greater understanding of your environment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003ECellular Reproduction: Mitosis\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrganisms require their cells to divide for the purposes of reproduction, growth, development, or repair. Cellular division is divided into two phases: mitosis and cytokinesis. Mitosis involves the division of the nuclear chromosomes, while cytokinesis is the division of the cytoplasmic components into new daughter cells. Serious consequences, such as cancer, can occur if this cell cycle is disrupted in some way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003ECellular Reproduction: Meiosis\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeiosis is a specialized type of cellular reproduction that only occurs in the ovaries and testes and results in an egg or sperm, respectively.
