Includes JSX, Callbacks, Events, \u002B More","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EThis course takes you step-by-step through the process of building a fully functional calculator in React. React, also known as React JS, is a powerful JavaScript library used for building custom, interactive user interfaces using UI components. Some of the most well known examples of organizations using React for their front-end include Netflix, Facebook, and Airbnb. Developed and maintained by Meta along with a community of independent developers, React remains free and open-source. React is a component based library built entirely on JavaScript, which makes it perfect for designing complex UI\u2019s. With React, developers can build encapsulated components that efficiently manage their own state and render UI updates specifically when data changes. For example, think of the automated content refresh feature you see on a twitter feed, or facebook like button. Here the state of the UI component changes on the page, without having to manually refresh when the data is updated. This is just one small, yet powerful feature of React.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThrough a complete hands-on project, this course will teach you all the fundamental principles of React that you must know to become a proficient React developer. We start right from the basics, including the tools needed to get started. From there we dive into JSX, functional components, props, callbacks, and various OnClick events. By this stage, the calculator will have a complete visual display, coupled with functional arithmetic operations. Students then move on to passing parameters in Callback functions, using the React State Hook, and debugging.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn addition to the hands-on React module, we also offer a comprehensive overview of JavaScript for those who need a refresher. Here we start with introducing students to the document object model (DOM) which defines the logical structure of HTML documents. From there we dive into JavaScript to demonstrate various methods in which DOM elements can be manipulated to add interactivity to static components. We start right from the basics, which includes JavaScript placement, and data output. From there we move on to variable declaration, arithmetic operations, operator precedence, data types, and objects. Once the foundations are covered, we move on to more complex operations using Arrays, Conditional Statements, JavaScript comparison operators, booleans and loops. Here students will learn to unleash the true power of JavaScript to render different outcomes based on user interaction. We will explore the use of functions to efficiently handle repetitive tasks and JavaScript events to handle output based on actions and occurrences. The section will conclude with a hands-on project where students will implement their knowledge to build a web based photo gallery and background color changer. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAs you can see this course covers a tremendous bit of ground. Best of all it features Tim Maclachlan - a renowned senior full-stack developer with over 20 years of commercial development experience. As a multi-faceted developer, Tim specializes in algorithmic, analytical and mobile development. To date, he\u2019s written hundreds of applications and worked in a number of industries from commercial aviation and military, to banking and finance.

This is because Pytest offers powerful features such as rewrite validation, a third-party attachment model, and a powerful yet simple device adaptation this is unmatched in any other testing framework. Pytest is a software testing framework, which means that Pytest is a command line tool that automatically finds tests you\u0027ve written, runs tests, and reports results. It has a library of extras that you can use in your tests to help you test more effectively. Can be extended to writing plug-ins or installing third-party plug-ins.

Once you\u2019ve written it, you\u2019re never going to write it again. But you\u2019ll definitely have to read it again. That piece of code might remain part of a project you\u2019re working on. Every time you go back to that file, you\u2019ll have to remember what that code does and why you wrote it, so readability matters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u2019re new to Python, \u003Cstrong\u003Eit can be difficult to remember what a piece of code does a few days, or weeks, after you wrote it\u003C/strong\u003E. If you follow PEP 8, you can be sure that you\u2019ve named your variables well. You\u2019ll know that you\u2019ve added enough whitespace so it\u2019s easier to follow logical steps in your code. You\u2019ll also have commented your code well. All this will mean your code is more readable and easier to come back to. As a beginner, following the rules of PEP 8 can make learning Python a much more pleasant task.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFollowing PEP 8 is particularly important if you\u2019re looking for a development job.\u003C/strong\u003E Writing clear, readable code shows professionalism.

You will Learn from the best Business and Make Profit !","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EThere\u2019s a HUGE difference between simply operating a used car dealership business and operating a profitable used car dealership. To get a better idea of the possible demand for used cars in your area, you\u2019ll need to crunch some numbers. By knowing the number of used cars sold in your area every year and month , you can estimate what percentage of the market you will be likely to be able to corner and reach. By locating the average profit per vehicle, you can get an approximate idea of how much profit and money your dealership able to make per year. While the groundwork associated with opening a dealership can be time-consuming, expensive, and demanding, the real test of your dealership\u2019s viability doesn\u2019t begin until after you open your doors to the public. Without the right management of your dealership, all the effort you put into laying the foundation will be wasted. While each state has its own rules and regulations, there are several important universal aspects of operating a car dealership and tips on how you can get the most out of your investment. Your customers are the single most important factor in the success or failure of your business, so taking the time to identify who they are and what they care about is absolutely vital. Take a look at the types of cars you plan on selling, then do some research to determine the age, gender, and income level of the average individual who owns those types of vehicles. Later down the line, this will allow you to tailor your marketing and advertising efforts toward those who are most likely to be interested in what you have to offer. Make sure to base any of your conclusions regarding your target clients on real actionable data; don\u2019t simply make assumptions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/car-flipping-earn-money-from-selling-used-cars-ocsaly/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4741312_7b69_3.jpg","duration":"1.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"23,850.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Beginner Used Car Business Leaders"],"tags":["Car Flipping"],"rating":{"count":77,"averageValue":"4.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"OCSALY Academy | 210.000\u002B Students","url":"/user/online-academy-of-computer-science/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.0666666}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"BEST_COURSE","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"1 day","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/wireshark-training/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5410020,"title":"Wireshark Ninja | Mastering Real Wireshark PROALL|2023WSHRK\u002B","shortDescription":"Unlock Your Network Analysis Potential: Certified Wireshark Expert for Ethical Hacking \u0026 Networking Course | 2023WSHRK\u002B","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EAre you ready to take your networking skills to the next level and become a certified expert in network analysis and ethical hacking?

An ethical hacker is also sometimes referred to as a white hat hacker. Many depend on ethical hackers to identify weaknesses in their networks, endpoints, devices, or applications. The hacker informs their client as to when they will be attacking the system, as well as the scope of the attack. Ethical hacker operates within the confines of their agreement with their client. They cannot work to discover vulnerabilities and then payment to fix them. This is what gray hat hackers do. Ethical hackers are also different from black hat hackers, who hack to harm others or benefit themselves without permission.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003EIs Ethical Hacking a good career?\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EYes, ethical hacking is a good career because it is one of the best ways to test a network. An ethical hacker tries to locate vulnerabilities in the network by testing different hacking techniques on them. In many situations, a network seems impenetrable only because it hasn\u2019t succumbed to an attack in years. However, this could be because black hat hackers are using the wrong kinds of methods. An ethical hacker can show a company how it may be vulnerable by levying a new type of attack that no one has ever tried before. When they successfully penetrate the system, the organization can then set up defenses to protect against this kind of penetration. This unique security opportunity makes the skills of an ethical hacker desirable for organizations that want to ensure their systems are well-defended against cyber criminals.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWhat skills do Ethical Hackers need to know?\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn addition to proficiency in basic computer skills and use of the command line, ethical hackers must also develop technical skills related to programming, database management systems (DBMS), use of the Linux operating system (OS), cryptography, creation and management of web applications and computer networks like DHCP, NAT, and Subnetting. Becoming an ethical hacker involves learning at least one programming language and having a working knowledge of other common languages like Python, SQL, C\u002B\u002B, and C. Ethical hackers must have strong problem-solving skills and the ability to think critically to come up with and test new solutions for securing systems. Ethical hackers should also understand how to use reverse engineering to uncover specifications and check a system for vulnerabilities by analyzing its code.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWhy do hackers use Linux?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003EMany hackers use the Linux operating system (OS) because Linux is a free and open-source OS, meaning that anyone can modify it. It\u2019s easy to access and customize all parts of Linux, which allows a hacker more control over manipulating the OS. Linux also features a well-integrated command-line interface, giving users a more precise level of control than many other systems offer. While Linux is considered more secure than many other systems, some hackers can modify existing Linux security distributions to use them as hacking software. Most ethical hackers prefer Linux because it\u0027s considered more secure than other operating systems and does not generally require the use of third-party antivirus software. Ethical hackers must be well-versed in Linux to identify loopholes and combat malicious hackers, as it\u2019s one of the most popular systems for web servers.\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EIs Ethical Hacking Legal?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003EYes, ethical hacking is legal because the hacker has full, expressed permission to test the vulnerabilities of a system. An ethical hacker operates within constraints stipulated by the person or organization for which they work, and this agreement makes for a legal arrangement. An ethical hacker is like someone who handles quality control for a car manufacturer. They may have to try to break certain components of the vehicle such as the windshield, suspension system, transmission, or engine to see where they are weak or how they can improve them. With ethical hacking, the hacker is trying to \u201Cbreak\u201D the system to ascertain how it can be less vulnerable to cyberattacks. However, if an ethical hacker attacks an area of a network or computer without getting expressed permission from the owner, they could be considered a gray hat hacker, violating ethical hacking principles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EWhat is the Certified Ethical Hacker ( CEH ) Certification Exam?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003EThe Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) certification exam supports and tests the knowledge of auditors, security officers, site administrators, security professionals, and anyone else who wants to ensure a network is safe against cyber criminals. With the CEH credential, you can design and govern the minimum standards necessary for credentialing information that security professionals need to engage in ethical hacking. You can also make it known to the public if someone who has earned their CEH credentials has met or exceeded the minimum standards. You are also empowered to reinforce the usefulness and self-regulated nature of ethical hacking. The CEH exam doesn\u2019t cater to specific security hardware or software vendors, such as Fortinet, Avira, Kaspersky, Cisco, or others, making it a vendor-neutral program.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWhat is the Certified Information Security Manager ( CISM ) exam?\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EPassing the Certified Information Security Manager (CISM) exam indicates that the credentialed individual is an expert in the governance of information security, developing security programs and managing them, as well as managing incidents and risks. For someone to be considered \u201Ccertified,\u201D they must have passed the exam within the last five years, as well as work full-time in a related career, such as information security and IT administration. The exam tests individuals\u2019 knowledge regarding the risks facing different systems, how to develop programs to assess and mitigate these risks, and how to ensure an organization\u0027s information systems conform to internal and regulatory policies. The exam also assesses how a person can use tools to help an organization recover from a successful attack.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EWhat are the different types of hackers?\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe different types of hackers include white hat hackers who are ethical hackers and are authorized to hack systems, black hat hackers who are cyber criminals, and grey hat hackers, who fall in-between and may not damage your system but hack for personal gain. There are also red hat hackers who attack black hat hackers directly. Some call new hackers green hat hackers. These people aspire to be full-blown, respected hackers. State-sponsored hackers work for countries and hacktivists and use hacking to support or promote a philosophy. Sometimes a hacker can act as a whistleblower, hacking their organization to expose hidden practices. There are also script kiddies and blue hat hackers. A script kiddie tries to impress their friends by launching scripts and downloading tools to take down websites and networks.

Ethical hackers and security experts carry out these tests to find any weak spots in a system\u2019s security before hackers with malicious intent find them and exploit them. Someone who has no previous knowledge of the system\u0027s security usually performs these tests, making it easier to find vulnerabilities that the development team may have overlooked. You can perform penetration testing using manual or automated technologies to compromise servers, web applications, wireless networks, network devices, mobile devices, and other exposure points.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat are the different types of penetration testing?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThere are many types of penetration testing.

An external penetration test targets a company\u0027s externally facing technology like its website or its network. Companies use these tests to determine how an anonymous hacker can attack a system. In a covert penetration test, also known as a double-blind penetration test, few people in the company will know that a pen test is occurring, including any security professional. This type of test will test not only systems but a company\u0027s response to an active attack. With a closed-box penetration test, a hacker may know nothing about the enterprise under attack other than its name. In an open-box test, the hacker will receive some information about a company\u0027s security to aid them in the attack.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWhat are the different stages of penetration testing?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EPenetration tests have five different stages. The first stage defines the goals and scope of the test and the testing methods that will be used. Security experts will also gather intelligence on the company\u0027s system to better understand the target. The second stage of a pen test is scanning the target application or network to determine how it will respond to an attack. You can do this through a static analysis of application code and dynamic scans of running applications and networks. The third stage is the attack phase when possible vulnerabilities discovered in the last stage are attacked with various hacking methods. In the fourth stage of a penetration test, the tester attempts to maintain access to the system to steal any sensitive data or damage systems. The fifth and final stage of a pen test is the reporting phase when testers compile the test results.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003ENo Previous Knowledge is needed!\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou don\u2019t need to have previous knowledge about all. \u003Cstrong\u003EThis course will take you from a beginner to a more advanced level with hands-on examples.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003ELearn the famous hacking framework Metasploit\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe will start with the very basics.

Either you are preparing yourself to enter into the field of automotive service, or you are expanding your skills to include automotive electrical systems. In either case, congratulations on selecting one of the most fast-paced segments of the automotive industry. Working with the electrical systems can be challenging, yet very rewarding; however, it can also be very frustrating at times. For many people, learning electrical systems can be a struggle. It is my hope that I am able to present the course to you in such a manner that you will not only understand electrical systems, but will excel at it. There are many ways the theory of electricity can be explained, and many metaphors can be used. Some compare electricity to a water flow, while others explain it in a purely scientific fashion. Everyone learns differently. I am presenting electrical theory in a manner that I hope will be clear and concise. If you do not fully comprehend a concept, then it is important to discuss it with your instructor. Electricity is somewhat abstract; so if you do have questions, be sure to ask me in Udemy ask section.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy Become an Electrical System Technician? \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the past, it was possible for technicians to work their entire careers and be able to almost completely avoid the vehicle\u2019s electrical systems. They would specialize in engines, steering/ suspension, or brakes. Today, there is not a system on the vehicle that is immune to the role of electrical circuits. Engine controls, electronic suspension systems, and anti-lock brakes are common on today\u2019s vehicles. Even electrical systems that were once thought of as being simple have evolved to computer controls. Headlights are now pulse-width modulated using high side drivers and will automatically brighten and dim based on the light intensity of oncoming traffic. Today\u2019s vehicles are equipped with twenty or more computers, laser-guided cruise control, sonar park assist, infrared climate control, fiber optics, and radio frequency transponders and decoders. Simple systems have become more computers reliant. For example, the horn circuit on the 2008 Chrysler 300C involves three separate control modules to function. Even the tires have computers involved, with the addition of tire pressure monitoring systems!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday\u2019s technician must possess a full and complete electrical background to be able to succeed.

Whenever they dismantle something, they can reassemble it how it was. Whenever they say that they need to investigate the hood, they can really get the darn thing open. Furthermore, when they need to change a level, they don\u0027t endure ten minutes attempting to sort out which end of the raise is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFortunately, you don\u0027t need to be brought into the world with a wrench in your grasp to know how to fix things \u2014 even things as apparently convoluted as a vehicle.
