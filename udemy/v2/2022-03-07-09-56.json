For example, the ignition system was only responsible for supplying the voltage needed to fire the spark plugs. Ignition timing was controlled by vacuum and mechanical advance systems. Today there are very few electrical systems that are still independent. Today, most manufacturers network their electrical systems together through computers. This means that information gathered by one system can be used by another. The result may be that a faulty component may cause several symptoms. Consider the following example. The wiper system can interact with the headlight system to turn on the headlights whenever the wipers are turned on. The wipers can interact with the vehicle speed sensor to provide for speed-sensitive wiper operation. The speed sensor may provide information to the antilock brake module. The antilock brake module can then share this information with the transmission control module, and the instrument cluster can receive vehicle speed information to operate the speedometer. If the vehicle speed sensor should fail, this could result in antilock brake operation and a warning light turned on in the dash. But it could also result in the speedometer not functioning, the transmission not shifting, and the wipers not operating properly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe computer is an electronic device that stores and processes data and are capable of operating other devices. The use of computers on automobiles has expanded to include control and operation of several functions, including climate control, lighting circuits, cruise control, antilock braking, electronic suspension systems, and electronic shift transmissions. Some of these are functions of what is known as a body control module (BCM). Some body computer-controlled systems include direction lights, rear window defogger, illuminated entry, intermittent wipers, and other systems that were once thought of as basic. A computer processes the physical conditions that represent information (data). The operation of the computer is divided into four basic functions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Input.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Processing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Storage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Output.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVehicle Communication NetworksMost manufacturers now use a system of vehicle communications called multiplexing(MUX) to allow control modules to share information. Multiplexing provides the ability to use a single circuit to distribute and share data between several control modules throughout the vehicle. Because the data is transmitted through a single circuit, bulky wiring harnesses are eliminated. Vehicle manufacturers will use multiplexing systems to enable different control modules to share information. A MUX wiring system uses bus data links that connect each module. The term bus refers to the transporting of data from one module to another. Each module can transmit and receive digital codes over the bus data links. The signal sent from a sensor can go to any one of the modules and can be shared by the other modules. Electronic Accessory systems with the growing use of computers, most systems can be controlled electronically. This provides for improved monitoring of the systems for proper operation and the ability to detect if a fault occurs. Electronic Cruise Control Systems. Cruise control is a system that allows the vehicle to maintain a preset speed with the driver\u2019s foot off of the accelerator. Most cruise control systems are a combination of electrical and mechanical components. Memory Seats. The memory seat feature allows the driver to program different seat positions that can be recalled at the push of a button. The memory seat feature is an addition to the basic power seat system. Most memory seat systems share the same basic operating principles, the difference being in programming methods and the number of positions that can be programmed. Most systems provide for two-seat positions to be stored in memory. An easy exit feature may be an additional function of the memory seat that provides for easier entrance and exit of the vehicle by moving the seat all the way back and down. Some systems also move the steering wheel up and to full retract. Electronic Sunroofs. Some manufacturers have introduced electronic control of their electric sunroofs. These systems incorporate a pair of relay circuits and a timer function into the control module. Motor rotation is controlled by relays that are activated according to signals received from the slide, tilt, and limit switches.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"Englisch","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/automotive-electrician-and-mechanic-training-aemt-2022/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4493870_9a11_2.jpg","duration":"2 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"4.034 Teilnehmer","lastUpdated":"Zuletzt aktualisiert: 1/2022","targetAudiences":["Beginner Automotive Electricians"],"tags":["Wissenschaft \u0026 Lehre","Technische Wissenschaften","Autoreparatur"],"rating":{"count":11,"averageValue":"4.2"},"instructors":[{"name":"OCSALY - Online Computer Science Academy","url":"/user/online-academy-of-computer-science/","totalNumberOfStudents":34949,"totalNumberOfReviews":202,"averageRating":4.059176650857142}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"AUTOMT2","originalPrice":"7.680\u00A0INR","discountedPrice":"Gratis","expirationText":"3 d\u00EDas","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/artificial-intelligence-exposed-future-10-extreme-edition/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":2767208,"title":"Artificial Intelligence Expert Course: Platinum Edition","shortDescription":"A breathtaking course in 2022 that teaches new-age Artificial Intelligence (AI) Technologies and Tools","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EWelcome to experience\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E \u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ea mind-blowing \u003C/em\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u0022\u003C/em\u003EArtificial Intelligence Expert Course\u003Cem\u003E\u0022 \u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ein 2022.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EArtificial Intelligence Expert Course: Platinum Edition - \u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThe course has now launched.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EArtificial Intelligence (AI)\u0026nbsp;seems to be a unique technology of making a machine, a robot fully autonomous.

Marketers may give sales a lead they believe to be ideal, but sales are not. It creates tension between two teams to work together, and AI is the perfect way to bring them together. AI can point out positive sales leads, which will also satisfy marketing, and ensure that potential customers are targeted at the right platforms. You don\u0027t want the company that sells accounting software to be advertised by someone.

It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables.

A person would be able to redo and reproduce an origami by unfolding it first. Knowing how cars work requires understanding each major and minor mechanical part and their purposes. The complex nature of the human anatomy requires people to understand each and every part of the body. How? By dissecting it. Reverse engineering is a way for us to understand how things were designed, why is it in its state, when it triggers, how it works, and what its purpose is. In effect, the information is used to redesign and improve for better performance and cost. It can even help fix defects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is amazing, and rather disconcerting, to realize how much software we run without knowing for sure what it does. We buy software off the shelf in shrink wrapped packages. We run setup utilities that install numerous files, change system settings, delete or disable older versions and superseded utilities, and modify critical registry files. Every time we access a Website, we may invoke or interact with dozens of programs and code segments that are necessary to give us the intended look, feel, and behaviour. We purchase CDs with hundreds of games and utilities or download them as shareware. We exchange useful programs with colleagues and friends when we have tried only a fraction of each program\u2019s features. Then, we download updates and install patches, trusting that the vendors are sure that the changes are correct and complete. We blindly hope that the latest change to each program keeps it compatible with all of the rest of the programs on our system. We rely on much software that we do not understand and do not know very well at all. I refer to a lot more than our desktop or laptop personal computers. The concept of ubiquitous computing, or \u201Csoftware everywhere,\u201D is rapidly putting software control and interconnection in devices throughout our environment. The average automobile now has more lines of software code in its engine controls than were required to land the Apollo astronauts on the Moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMalware analysis is the study of malware\u0027s behaviour. The objective of malware analysis is to understand the working of malware and how to detect and eliminate it. It involves analysing the suspect binary in a safe environment to identify its characteristics and functionalities so that better defences can be built to protect an organization\u0027s network.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImagine if the Trojan Horse was thoroughly inspected and torn down before it was allowed to enter the gates of a city. This would probably cause a few dead soldiers outside the gate fighting for the city. The next time the city is sent another Trojan Horse, archers would know where to point their arrows. And no dead soldiers this time. The same is true for malware analysis\u2014by knowing the behaviours of a certain malware through reverse engineering, the analyst can recommend various safeguards for the network.

The term digital forensics was originally used as a synonym for computer forensics but has expanded to cover investigation of all devices capable of storing digital data. With roots in the personal computing revolution of the late 1970s and early 1980s, the discipline evolved in a haphazard manner during the 1990s, and it was not until the early 21st century that national policies emerged.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDigital forensics investigations have a variety of applications. The most common is to support or refute a hypothesis before criminal or civil courts. Criminal cases involve the alleged breaking of laws that are defined by legislation and that are enforced by the police and prosecuted by the state, such as theft and assault against the person. Civil cases on the other hand deal with protecting the rights and property of individuals (often associated with family disputes) but may also be concerned with contractual disputes between commercial entities where a form of digital forensics referred to as electronic discovery (ediscovery) may be involved\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring the 1980s very few specialized digital forensic tools existed, and consequently investigators often performed live analysis on media, examining computers from within the operating system using existing sysadmin tools to extract evidence. This practice carried the risk of modifying data on the disk, either inadvertently or otherwise, which led to claims of evidence tampering. A number of tools were created during the early 1990s to address the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDigital forensics is commonly used in both criminal law and private investigation. Traditionally it has been associated with criminal law, where evidence is collected to support or oppose a hypothesis before the courts. As with other areas of forensics this is often a part of a wider investigation spanning a number of disciplines.

It produces the power that turns the wheels and electricity for lights and other systems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost automobiles are powered by an internal combustion engine. Fuel, usually gasoline or petrol, is burned with air to create gases that expand. A spark plug creates a spark that ignites the gas and makes it burn. This energy moves through cylinders in which pistons slide up and down. They are attached to rods that move a crankshaft. Normal car engines have four to six cylinders but there are also models with eight and sixteen cylinders. The turning movement is passed through the drivetrain to the drive wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe engine and all parts that carry power to the wheels are called the drivetrain. It includes the transmission, drive shaft, differential, the axles and the drive wheels that move the car. While most cars have drive wheels in the front, some have them in the back. Cars that need to drive over all kinds of ground have a four-wheel drive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe transmission controls the speed and torque. When a car travels at a normal speed on a flat road it does not need so much torque to keep it moving, but when you want to start a car from a hill the engine must produce more power. Gears control speed and power of the engine in different driving conditions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn cars with manual transmission you have to change gears by pressing down the clutch with your foot and moving a lever. Cars with automatic transmission change gears without control by the driver. Lower gears give the car more torque and speed. When the car moves faster the transmission shifts to higher gears.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe driveshaft carries the power to the axle which is connected to the wheels. It has several joints which make the axle and wheels moveable as the car drives on uneven and bumpy roads.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe differential is connected to the rear end of the driveshaft. It lets the wheels turn at different speeds because in curves the outer wheels must travel a greater distance than the inner ones.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"Ingl\u00EAs","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/car-repair-auto-mechanic-training-masterclass-crtc-2021/","imageUri":"https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4408498_f040_6.jpg?secure=Yj3QPsbxMJbBrcCttmd8lQ%3D%3D%2C1646679679","duration":"5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"9.400 alunos","lastUpdated":"\u00DAltima atualiza\u00E7\u00E3o em 1/2022","targetAudiences":["Beginner car mechanics"],"tags":["Ensino e estudo acad\u00EAmico","Engenharia","Reparo de carros"],"rating":{"count":38,"averageValue":"3.8"},"instructors":[{"name":"OCSALY - Online Computer Science Academy","url":"/user/online-academy-of-computer-science/","totalNumberOfStudents":33350,"totalNumberOfReviews":201,"averageRating":4.059176650857142}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"AUTOMECHANIC99","originalPrice":"11.840\u00A0INR","discountedPrice":"7.696\u00A0INR","expirationText":"5 horas","discountPercentage":35}}},"freeCourses":{"https://www.udemy.com/course/whatsapp-marketing-messaging-automation/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4582142,"title":"WhatsApp Marketing: Messaging Automation Course","shortDescription":"Save endless hours on WhatsApp Business, sending customized messages to thousands of potentials customers daily.","longDescription":null,"language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/whatsapp-marketing-messaging-automation/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4582142_e9ee.jpg","duration":"0","enrolledStudentsCount":"375 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["If you want to develop your business or company through WhatsApp.","Everyone who seeks to automate their work and communicate with their customers better and faster.","If you aim to increase your sales and product awareness, thus reaching thousands of interested people."],"tags":["Marketing","Social Media Marketing","Whatsapp Marketing"],"rating":null,"instructors":[{"name":"Mohamed Fakhry","url":"/user/mohamed-saeed-73/","totalNumberOfStudents":1331,"totalNumberOfReviews":79,"averageRating":4.875430395652175}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":true,"couponData":null},"https://www.udemy.com/course/blockchain-build-a-dapp-using-solidity-hardhat-and-react/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4555344,"title":"Blockchain: Build a Dapp using Solidity, Hardhat and React","shortDescription":"Harness the power of the most disruptive technology, since the internet through building a hands on application.","longDescription":null,"language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/blockchain-build-a-dapp-using-solidity-hardhat-and-react/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4555344_f53a_3.jpg","duration":"1","enrolledStudentsCount":"423 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Any students in college who want to start a career in Blockchain \u0026 Cryptos.","Any Professional in job who want to start a career in Blockchain \u0026 Cryptos.","Any Blockchain, Bitcoin \u0026 Cryptos enthusiast"],"tags":["IT \u0026 Software","Other IT \u0026 Software","DApp"],"rating":null,"instructors":[{"name":"Kavit Mehta","url":"/user/kavit3/","totalNumberOfStudents":554,"totalNumberOfReviews":0,"averageRating":0}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":true,"couponData":null},"https://www.udemy.com/course/sell-more-online-courses-by-using-udemy-insights-unofficial/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4540912,"title":"Sell More Online Courses by Using Udemy Insights -Unofficial","shortDescription":"Triple your income with Udemy Marketplace Insights tool.
