In the case of a computer server farm, cooling capacity is one of the, if not most important criteria. Computer servers will generate heat whilst operating, most of the time operating 24 hours a day. Cooling capacity must be sufficient to stop the servers from over heating and therefore turning off which could lead to a huge loss of data.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHeating Capacity\u003C/strong\u003E - Whilst not as important as cooling capacity in our case, still required in extreme temperatures such as Anchorage, Alaska where average high temperatures in January are around 23\u00BAF. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHumidity Control\u003C/strong\u003E - In a computer farm where there are many electrical systems, humidity control is important to ensure the servers function properly.
