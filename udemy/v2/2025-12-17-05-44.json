COEs offer clustering and convert your nodes into one super computer, make intelligent\u00A0\u00A0decisions as to where to schedule the containers, connect containers running on different nodes by setting up multi host network and offer many other interesting features such as fault tolerance, zero downtime deployments etc.\u00A0\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKubernetes is the gold standard in the world of container orchestration.

Thats one of the reasons why it took us more than 4 months to even launch the course in its first form.\u00A0 We\u00A0have also started incorporating some new and useful techniques including glassboard, mindmaps to explain the concepts better and make things easier.
