We start right from the ground up, where students will learn to navigate the Lightroom interface, create image catalogs and import hundreds of images for the purpose of sorting and organizing photo collections. Here we will explore important concepts such as catalog settings, import file handling, auto renaming, metadata presets, and import preferences. Once students are familiar with the basics, we take a theoretical dive into a number of concepts and key terms that are essential in the photography and digital image editing arena. Here we will explore various file formats, color spaces, image resolution, pixel density, and much more. From there, we transition back to completing application setup by exploring file handling options, interface preferences, identity plate setup, and watermarking with both text and graphics.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOnce we\u2019ve covered the foundations, students will take a deep dive into the Lightroom Library Module. The library module is an integral part of the Lightroom application, which is used for a number of important functions. This includes populating, sorting, and organizing image collection sets. This section starts from the basics, where we explore the Library interface. From there, students learn to filter files, paint keywords, and generate keyword sets. We\u2019ll also demonstrate how to use various library views for image comparison, and advanced sorting. Once students have a handle of the foundations, we cover more intermediate sorting techniques using star ratings, pick and reject flags, color labels, and smart collections.

Linode is a popular cloud hosting provider that offers a range of services, including virtual private servers (VPS), storage, and networking. Students will learn how to deploy and configure a virtual instance and use it to host a website or application using LAMP Stack. LAMP stands for Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP and is a popular stack used to build dynamic websites and web applications. Students will learn how to install and configure each component of the stack and use it to create a functional website or web application. The course will then cover Linux foundations, where we explore the Linux file system, basic commands, and user accounts.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn the following section students explore server security, including best practices for securing a server and common security threats.
