Linear programming also makes the basic foundation behind complex optimization tools like Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) and Column generation. In this course, we will study the basic theoretical concepts related to linear programming. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe course is organized as follows. In the first section, we will introduce linear programming, and we will explore the convexity and types of optimalities. Then, in the second section, we will build up on the basics to learn ways to solve the linear program using the simplex method. We will then explore the concept of linear programming duality. We will also go through some of the hardest-to-understand concepts like strong duality, complementary slackness, and Farkas\u0027 lemma. Furthermore, we try to understand these concepts in an easy-to-follow way. This allows one to obtain lower bounds on the minimization problem and provide proof of optimality or Infeasibility. In the last section, we will explore how to perform sensitivity analysis (the effects of changing parts of a linear program). At the end of each section, there are assignments to help you evaluate your knowledge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you would have noticed, this course doesn\u0027t explore modeling optimization problems as a linear program much.

Performance goals are specific targets or objectives that individuals or teams are expected to achieve within a given timeframe.

We will explore the significance of performance goals in the realm of human resources and the benefits they bring to both employees and organizations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Clarity and Focus: Performance goals provide clarity and direction to employees.

Motivation and Engagement: Well-defined performance goals have a motivational effect on employees. When employees have challenging yet attainable goals, they are more likely to feel engaged and motivated to perform at their best. Goals create a sense of purpose and provide a framework for employees to channel their energy and expertise towards achieving desired outcomes. They can enhance job satisfaction and increase employee commitment to the organization.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Performance Evaluation: Performance goals serve as a basis for assessing employee performance. By setting clear objectives, managers can evaluate and measure the progress and achievements of employees. Regular performance evaluations help identify areas of improvement, provide constructive feedback, and recognize top performers. Objective evaluation criteria linked to performance goals ensure fairness and transparency in the assessment process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Skill Development: Performance goals create opportunities for employees to develop and enhance their skills and competencies. By setting goals that require employees to stretch beyond their current capabilities, organizations can foster a culture of continuous learning and development. Employees are motivated to acquire new knowledge, acquire relevant training, and seek growth opportunities to meet or exceed their goals. This, in turn, benefits both the individual and the organization by building a skilled and capable workforce.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Alignment with Organizational Objectives: Performance goals play a crucial role in aligning individual and team efforts with the broader organizational objectives. When goals are set in line with the strategic priorities of the organization, employees understand how their work contributes to the overall success of the company. This alignment promotes a sense of organizational unity and helps employees see the bigger picture, fostering a collective effort towards achieving organizational goals. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Accountability and Performance Improvement: Performance goals create a sense of accountability among employees. When employees have clear goals and know they will be evaluated based on their performance, they are more likely to take ownership of their work and strive for excellence.
