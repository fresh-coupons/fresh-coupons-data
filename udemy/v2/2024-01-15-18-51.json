Linear regression is one of the easiest and most popular Machine Learning algorithms. It is a statistical method that is used for predictive analysis. Linear regression makes predictions for real or numeric variables such as sales, salary, age, product price, etc. A linear regression model describes the relationship between a dependent variable, y, and one or more independent variables, X. The dependent variable is also called the response variable. Independent variables are also called explanatory or predictor variables. Continuous predictor variables are also called covariates, and categorical predictor variables are also called factors.

One unique feature which comes along with Pyspark is the use of datasets and not data frames as the latter is not provided by Pyspark. Practitioners need more tools that are often more reliable and faster when it comes to streaming real-time data. The earlier tools such as Map-reduce made use of the map and the reduce concepts which included using the mappers, then shuffling or sorting and then reducing them into a single entity. This MapReduce provided a way of parallel computation and calculation. The Pyspark makes use of in-memory techniques that don\u2019t make use of the space storage being put into the hard disk.

It provides us with the list of services and various tools which are required for building the Mobile User Interface with the native feel and the same look. The ionic framework needs to have a native wrapper interface using which it will be able to run the ionic based applications on mobile devices. Moreover, it can be known to be the front-end based HTML framework which comprises many front end languages, and therefore it is built on top of the possibly best front end framework, AngularJS, and Cordova. It is an HTML5 based Mobile Application development framework which is targeted at building mobile-based hybrid apps. Ionic can be thought of as a front end UI framework that is used to handle the basic look and feel and the User interface based interactions that are required for the app to be compelling. It is somewhat like Bootstrap for native applications that are built for the support of a broad range of common and basic native mobile-based components, beautiful design, and slick animations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe features would include AngularJS based Model View Controller architecture for creating and building rich SPAs also known as Single Page Applications particularly optimized for the device and mobile-based devices. Other features would include CSS components that come along with the native look and feel and are used to provide all the elements which are typically required by a mobile-based web application. The default styling of the components can be easily overridden which can accommodate their designs. The JavaScript components extend the CSS component capabilities and also Javascript related functions and their capabilities to cover the mobile elements which cannot be only done with HTML and CSS. Other features include the ones related to Cordova plugins that offer the API related to the usage of the mobile-based native device functions with JavaScript code. The Ionic CLI is a NodeJS based utility which is powered by the various commands required for building, starting, running as well as emulating ionic applications. The views are a very useful platform that is required for sharing, uploading, and testing your applications for native devices.

It identifies who has power and accountability, and who makes decisions. It is, in essence, a toolkit that enables management and the board to deal more effectively with the challenges of running a company. Corporate governance ensures that businesses have appropriate decision-making processes and controls in place so that the interests of all stakeholders (shareholders, employees, suppliers, customers and the community) are balanced. Good corporate governance can benefit investors and other stakeholders, while bad governance can lead to scandal and ruin. Governance refers to the set of rules, controls, policies, and resolutions put in place to direct corporate behavior. A board of directors is pivotal in governance, while proxy advisors and shareholders are important stakeholders who can affect governance. Communicating a company\u0027s corporate governance is a key component of community and investor relations. For instance, Apple Inc.\u0027s investor relations site profiles its corporate leadership (the executive team and board of directors) and provides information on its committee charters and governance documents, such as bylaws, stock ownership guidelines, and articles of incorporation. Most successful companies strive to have exemplary corporate governance.

This module helps developers to seamlessly integrate Python and Mongo DB. Now let us take some time to do a deep dive into individually understanding Python and MongoDB. To start, Python is a high-level general programming language, which was aimed to be used as a programing language for nearly all use cases and has the potential to enhance the code readability, due to its usage of extensive whitespaces. The approach of object-oriented and super language constructions makes it the go-to programming language for any type of use cases ranging from data analytics to API development and many such more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow coming to what Mongo is. Mongo is a database program that was built with the intent of it being cross-platform. Hence you would see a lot of programming language which has the integration functionality with Mongo DB. This program is classified as a NoSQL, essentially meaning a non-relational database. Now a question might strike, that if it is non-relational, then how elements are represented in Mongo.

The training program will help the trainee to perform all the statistical analysis with Minitab. It is also intended to make the trainees cover all the topics that fall under the domain of Minitab. Topics like Minitab GUI and Descriptive Statistics, Statistical Analysis using Minitab, Correlation Techniques in Minitab and Predictive Modeling using Excel will be covered in this training module and Project on Data Analytics using Minitab and Project on Minitab \u2013 Regression Modeling will be covered in the project module. The goal of this course is to help an individual to achieve knowledge of working with Minitab to perform time series analysis and forecasting of data in all sorts of statistics based problems. It will help all the interested trainees who are willing to extend their knowledge base concerned with Data analytics. This training will also assist the trainees to understand the sort of problems that could be resolved using this. After the finishing of the course, the trainee will advance with the skills needed for time series analysis and forecasting of data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo understand the meaning of the \u201Cname\u201D of the course, let us break down the curse and understand them word by word so that the intent of the course would be clear to our learners and we would set an expectation for our learners who would be pursuing the course. Let us start to understand what Minitab is. Minitab is a software used in use cases of statistics. Minitab, as the software is capable of data analysis, pattern detection through statistics, data crunching. Most of the calculation is automated, and graphs are generated as per the functionality required by the analyst working on the use cases. For this course specifically, we would be exploiting the use of Minitab for Time Series Analysis and Forecasting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, let us understand what time series analysis is. Time series data is a collection of data over some time or interval. The data when captured over time typically might have some internal structure, for example, autocorrelation, trends, seasonality, stationarity, and many such fundamentals. For example, let us think about the sales of umbrellas or raincoats. We can see that in the selling of these items we might encounter a seasonality aspect, that they might be sold high during the onset of the rainy season. Also, we can see that the data itself might auto-correlate itself to the promos that might have been set by some stores, online or offline, and many more such intricate detailing through the understanding of time series analysis fundamentals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow when we know how to analyze the time series it becomes pretty evident that what exactly to do with the studies or hypothesis we developed as a part of the study. The answer lies in prediction! We would understand the fundamentals through historical time series data and then utilize that deep insight to predict or forecast for the future. In this way, we would be able to capture the historical trends and seasonality and utilize them to have a better insight into what\u2019s in store in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis course is a collection of well-crafted tutorials or topics we would naturally go about if we must fully understand the topic of time series analysis and forecasting. This course will allow you to get a sense of what is lying in the basket of time series analysis in the professional project which you would encounter as soon as you take up the project in your organization. This course makes you reach that level of being the \u201Chandful\u201D of people who are capable of cracking even the toughest nut in the professional world.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis confidence you build in the course of this training will go a long way in not only analyzing the sense of time series data but also give you the capability to mentor people who would have just started their track on time series analysis. This course doesn\u2019t differentiate between a beginner or an advanced learner. We have to learn for everyone who is here to expand their horizon of knowledge. Lastly, we would like to mention that this course will lay a strong foundation in time series analysis so that you would be able to build a strong mansion on this foundation layer.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/predictive-modeling-and-time-series-analysis-with-minitab/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4722578_a844_3.jpg","duration":"2.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"13,039.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["We start everything from scratch and try to build from there and the only thing we require is a sense of perseverance and full dedication towards the course.

It talks and explains the networking basics which is much more helpful for the beginners who are new to the world and domain of networking. This OSPF Certification course of Routing Protocol OSPF builds a strong foundation for them to prepare for good level certifications like CCNA. You will be able to learn all the terminologies and key functionalities related to routing protocols. There is n number of routing protocols that are developed today but only very few have been adopted by the industry. In this course, all those concepts will be explained in detail and you can practice them at your ease. The broad areas to be covered are related to configurations, operations, and troubleshooting. Apart from that, there are a few use cases of two very popular Routing protocols that work on the principle of OSPF and have their level of advantages. This OSPF Certification Module describes how to connect and configure and operate Open Shortest Path First which was specifically designed for IP networks and therefore supports IP tagging and sub-netting of extremely derived information related to routing. It also allows the packet-based information and authentication to take place and also makes use of the multicast for Internet protocol when either sending or receiving any packet\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis course module named Routing Protocols RIP and EIGRP is quite similar to the one used above and is also responsible to teach you many basics and fundamental concepts such as those related to troubleshooting, operation, and configuration. The two most important routing protocols which will be explained in detail are the RIP also known as Routing information protocol and the other is EIGRP which is the abbreviated form for Extended interior Gateway protocol. In the RIP protocol, the oldest of the vectors for distance IP Routing protocols are still put to use and thereby getting various enhancements. There are currently two versions that exist for the RIP viz. RIPv1 and RIPv2. RIPv1 is also said to be the classful protocol which means that it is not classless whereas if you talk about the RIPv2, it is considered to be the classless support routing protocol and IPv6 is the one whose support is extended to RIPv2 with the next-gen RIP which is also termed as RIPng. EIGRP, on the other hand, is related to the Interior Gateway protocol as it is a proprietary protocol of the company CISCO. This protocol is occasionally described as the distance vector routing protocol which also acts and imitates like a link state-oriented protocol. Distance vector-based protocols share everything of which they are aware of. The only limitation they carry is that the amount of information shared is only among the neighbors which are directly or indirectly connected with each other. Link state-based protocols announce that the information present is only about the direction and not indirectly connected links. However, they are also responsible to share the routing protocol information among themselves in all the areas they deem fit among all the routes in their domain or area.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/cisco-ospf-hands-on-certification-training/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4844382_3644_3.jpg","duration":"10.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"13,773.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["The target audience for this course is anybody who has a keen interest in the field of digital communication and is also aware of how the basics of understanding the networks and other routing protocols and mechanisms such as OSPF Routing.

We combine eye and eyebrows, nose, cheek and lips movement to show our different moods and emotions like happiness, sadness, depression, sorrow, anger, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStudies also suggest that facial expressions are the result of the perception and interpretation of other\u2019s body language training too. The brain processes the expression readings simultaneously and prepares the congruent expression for it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col start=\u00222\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBody posture\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBody postures are also a determinant of emotions. As per research of human behavior when a body posture is compared with that of the neutral emotion then it can be clearly understood how a body behaves in different emotional stages. Say for an instance, when a person is angry, he or she will reflect dominant postures whereas when someone is feeling fearful, he or she will display avoidance and submissive tendencies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the case of standing or sitting postures, one who is leaning forward sitting in his or her chair with a nodding head means that he or she is eager to be a part of the conversation. But when someone is sitting with his or her arms and legs crossed, it means that he or she is not at all open to the discussion. Tapping feet also means that the person is eager to leave the discussion and becoming impatient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, when someone is standing with his or her arms on the waist in akimbo style and the feet directing towards the speaker, it shows that he or she is very much interested and attentive in the conversation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col start=\u00223\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGesture\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGestures include the movements of the hands, fingers, arms, head and legs which can be either voluntary or involuntary. Gestures shown by arms in a discussion can mean a lot of things like someone sitting or interacting with folded arms means he or she is not welcoming the conversation. The gesture reflects unwillingness and closure to the conversation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHand gestures tell us a lot of things about the person\u2019s state of mind. Relaxed and stable hands signify confidence in the character and depth one has in the subject whereas the person continuously clenching signifies anger or stress. Someone wringing hands shows anxiety and nervousness.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinger gestures vary in their meaning from culture to culture. Pointing fingers towards someone is not acceptable and considered as rude. Thumbs up means everything is ok but in Iran this gesture is considered as an insult. While speaking people tend to use their fingers and hand movements to demonstrate something. This also gives a good impact on the listener. The demonstration is emphasized with the gestures and sometimes the speaker also asks the listeners to participate in it by using his or her fingers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col start=\u00224\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHandshakes\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHandshake is the common gesture to greet everyone nowadays. In the corporate world it is a welcome sign too. Shaking hand also means congratulating someone on their success. When there is a mutual success then both the parties shake hands in a formal way to express gratitude for the support and team work. The degree of grip varies and their meaning too. Tight handshakes show confidence whereas it is not good for the womenfolk. But in some culture like the Hindus and Muslim do not prefer handshakes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col start=\u00225\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOculesics\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe study of eye movements is a subcategory of the study of body language. This category covers the meaning of eye behavior, eye movement, and other related non-verbal communication. Normally avoiding eye contact means the person is either lying or hiding something.
