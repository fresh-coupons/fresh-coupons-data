Indeed, you will understand all the basics of this programming language. From the starting point where you are going to learn what to instal and how to do it to write your first basic lines of code to the more advanced part that contains things such as statements, functions and loop and various practical projects, this course has everything you need to start your JavaScript programming journey. Also, this course has been created not only to help you learn JavaScript but to also, help you have a clear understanding of all the basics of this programming language. Also, this course will teach something very important that can be used in any other programming language and it\u0027s the programming logic. Indeed, by creating various applications, you will learn to think like a programmer and this can be applied in any other programming language. In other words, if you don\u0027t have any programming experience prior to this course, by completing it you will learn the programming logic and this will help succed not only in JavaScript but it\u0027s useful in any other programming language.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, this course is built around a very simple but effective logic that is learning by practice. Indeed, this simply means that this course is definely not theoritical even if it contains some classes that present various Javascript concepts. In other words, this course is built on a logic of learning by practice . This means that you will find plenty of exercices all over the course to help you understand and master this programming language to finaly achieve your end goal of learning how to program in JavaScript.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFor who is this course designed\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a lot of JavaScript courses that exist all over the internet.

Also, it\u0027s important to mention that each element in this course is presented with a multitude of various programming examples that will allow you to practice everything that you will learn all over the course. In other words, if you never wrote a single line of code or did any programming prior this course and you always wanted to start somewhere then you will probably love this course. The way this course is presented and structured is here to help you achieve your obective of starting in the programming world and have a solid understanding of JavaScript programming by the end of this course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy should I take this course\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf programming in JavaScript is something that you always had a passion for and you always wanted to learn more about that programming language then you should definitely take this course. The first thing that this course will teach you is understanding the logic of programming or in other words how to think like a programmer and how to use with JavaScript .
