With an exponentially growing community around data science, machine learning, AI, web dev and more, Python is a language that opens programming access to the world.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the realm of server side software languages, Python is considered easy to read, write and learn.

Our emphasis here is on practice. You will learn how to operate multilayer perceptrons using the R program, how to build and train models and how to make predictions on new data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll the procedures are explained live, on real life data sets.

You will find out what multilayer perceptrons are how they learn, what procedure they employ to make predictions. Also, you\u2019ll learn the main prediction accuracy metrics for both numeric and categorical response variables.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the second section we\u2019ll build and train a multilayer perceptron to predict a bank customers\u2019 default. In other words, our response is categorical in this case. After training the network, we\u2019ll use it to measure prediction accuracy in the test set. But that\u2019s not all. We will also try to improve our model by manipulating various parameters of the network and test our model accuracy using the k-fold cross-validation technique.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the third section we build and train a model with a numeric response variable. More exactly, we\u2019ll predict car prices depending on their technical features, using a multilayer perceptron, of course. After building the model we\u2019ll measure its accuracy on the test set, try to improve it by modifying he network parameters and, finally, validate our model using the k-fold cross-validation method. So, the same steps as in the previous section, but this time for the particular case of a numeric dependent variable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA number of practical exercises are proposed at the end of the course.
