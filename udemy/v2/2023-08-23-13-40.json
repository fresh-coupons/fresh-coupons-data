There are different busbar electrode combinations, there\u0027s a different voltage range and conductor gap information, there\u0027s information about the box, the height, the width, and the depth, and how they use that enclosure box to calculate the instant energy levels. There\u0027s the arcing current variation corrective factor that goes into a lot of detail, there is arc flash test, the continuous voltage spectrum, the enclosure size and correction factor, the table of equipment and class types, the minimum arcing current adjustments, and the 125 kVA transformer cutoff whatever happened to that, so we\u0027ll talk about that as well. Grounded versus ungrounded systems, the two-second rule cut off where that is, and as well as what\u0027s next? what goes above and beyond this 2018 standard?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ESo, stick around you\u0027ll expect to learn a lot from this standard and from this course.

You will learn about variables and how to declare and assign values to them. We will also cover the importance of using strict mode and how it helps in writing more reliable code.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext, we dive into the world of data types in JavaScript. You will learn about primitive data types such as strings, numbers, booleans, and the special value \u0022null\u0022 and \u0022undefined.\u0022 We will explore how to work with these data types, perform operations on them, and understand type conversions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInteraction is a crucial aspect of JavaScript programming, and in this course, we will cover various methods to interact with the user.

We\u0027ll use San Diego climate data from the National Centers for the Environmental Information (NCEI) Global Summary of the Year weather database, but you\u0027re welcome to use data from any city. To approximate missing values in the dataset, we\u0027ll use linear interpolation and install the necessary packages such as tidyverse, ggplot2, readr, and imputeTS. We\u0027ll make basic graphs with ggplot2, including features such as the axes, data points, and lines.

In this course you will develop a strong understanding of one the most utilised network, multilayer perceptron, suitable for both classification and regression problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mathematics behind neural networks is particularly complex, but you don\u2019t need to be a mathematician to take this course and fully benefit from it. Our emphasis here is on practice. You will learn how to operate multilayer perceptrons using the R program, how to build and train models and how to make predictions on new data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll the procedures are explained live, on real life data sets. So you will advance fast and be able to apply your knowledge immediately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis course contains three sections.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first section is dedicated to the basic concepts related to neural networks and predictive analytics. You will find out what multilayer perceptrons are how they learn, what procedure they employ to make predictions. Also, you\u2019ll learn the main prediction accuracy metrics for both numeric and categorical response variables.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the second section we\u2019ll build and train a multilayer perceptron to predict a bank customers\u2019 default. In other words, our response is categorical in this case. After training the network, we\u2019ll use it to measure prediction accuracy in the test set. But that\u2019s not all. We will also try to improve our model by manipulating various parameters of the network and test our model accuracy using the k-fold cross-validation technique.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the third section we build and train a model with a numeric response variable. More exactly, we\u2019ll predict car prices depending on their technical features, using a multilayer perceptron, of course. After building the model we\u2019ll measure its accuracy on the test set, try to improve it by modifying he network parameters and, finally, validate our model using the k-fold cross-validation method. So, the same steps as in the previous section, but this time for the particular case of a numeric dependent variable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA number of practical exercises are proposed at the end of the course.

With my video lectures, you will find it easy to master these major neural networks and build them in R.
