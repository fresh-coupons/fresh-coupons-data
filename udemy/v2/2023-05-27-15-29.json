At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E* Javascript Course Contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Introduction\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Array\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Variables\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Functions\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Objects\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Control Statements\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Cookies\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Loop statements\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Data Structures\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Error Handling\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Regular Expressions\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESee you inside the course\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-for-beginners-complete-course/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4200368_f71e_5.jpg","duration":"2 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"85,124.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["For Javascript  Programming Beginners","For People New to Javascript","For People Who want to learn Javascript Fundamentals and later Transition into Web Development"],"tags":["JavaScript"],"rating":{"count":944,"averageValue":"4.2"},"instructors":[{"name":"PROPER DOT INSTITUTE","url":"/user/vivek-dahibhate-2/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.2166667}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"C1BBA21E4517E1BE473D","originalPrice":"\u20B91,299","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-elastic-load-balancing-with-auto-scaling-groups/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4925158,"title":"AWS: Elastic Load Balancing with Auto Scaling Groups","shortDescription":"AWS MFA | Amazon EC2 | Amazon Machine Images | IAM Roles | Elastic IP | EBS | Snapshots | EFS | ELB | ASG | Route 53","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EThis course offers an introduction to the Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform. The focus of the course will be on four key services, including: Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), AWS Storage Solutions, and Elastic Load Balancers (ELB) integrated with Auto Scaling Groups (ASG). \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAmazon EC2 is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It allows users to launch virtual machines (VMs) on demand and pay only for the compute resources they use. In this course, we will explore the different types of instances available, as well as how to launch, configure, and manage EC2 instances.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn addition to the EC2 service, we also explore AWS storage solutions including Elastic Block Store (EBS), Elastic File System (EFS), Snapshots, and Amazon Machine Images (AMIs). EBS is a block-level storage service for use with EC2 instances. It provides persistent storage for data that needs to be frequently accessed. EFS is a file-level storage service for use with EC2 instances. It allows users to create and configure file systems that can be accessed from multiple instances. Snapshots are point-in-time copies of EBS volumes that can be used for backup and recovery. AMIs are pre-configured virtual machine images that can be used to launch EC2 instances. In this course, we will explore the different storage options available and how to use them to manage data on the AWS platform.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOnce students have a handle on the foundations, we explore more intermediate topics relevant to workload distribution through the integration of ELBs and ASGs. Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs) are used to distribute incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances. They automatically scale to handle incoming traffic and can also be used to improve availability and fault tolerance. In this course, we will explore the different types of load balancers available, as well as how to configure and use them to distribute traffic across multiple instances.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWe will demonstrate how to integrate the ELBs with Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs) to ensure workloads are only distributed to healthy nodes within the EC2 service. ASGs allow users to automatically scale the number of EC2 instances in response to changing demand. They automatically launch and terminate instances based on predefined rules, ensuring that the number of instances is always sufficient to handle incoming traffic. In this course, we will explore how to configure and use ASGs to automatically scale the number of instances on the AWS platform.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThroughout the course, we will use hands-on exercises to help students gain practical experience with the AWS platform. Students will have the opportunity to launch and configure EC2 instances, create and manage storage volumes, configure load balancers and auto scaling groups, and work with other AWS services. By the end of the course, students will have a solid understanding of the AWS platform and will be able to use it to build scalable and reliable cloud-based applications.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-elastic-load-balancing-with-auto-scaling-groups/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4925158_0612.jpg","duration":"8 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"7,097.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Students interested in learning the foundations of AWS","Students interested in Cloud Computing","Students interested in exploring the Amazon EC2 Service","Students interested in exploring various EC2 Storage Solutions (EFS, EBS)","Students interested in setting up Highly Available cloud setups using ELBs, and ASGs on AWS"],"tags":["Cloud Computing","Amazon Elastic Block Store","AWS Elastic Load Balancing"],"rating":{"count":33,"averageValue":"4.4"},"instructors":[{"name":"YouAccel Training","url":"/user/youaccel/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.467742}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"YOUACCEL97668","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"3 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/arduino-digital-meter-rule-using-arduino/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4769254,"title":"Digital Meter Rule using Arduino","shortDescription":"Learn how to use a digital meter to measure voltage, current, and resistance","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EArduino and the digital meter: How do they work together?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Arduino digital meter rule allows you to read and understand the voltage, current, and amperage drawn from a circuit.

Some of which will be good and many are just plain harmful. One of the reasons why my weight loss program is ideal for most people is that it leans heavily on using the natural body movements with long-term approaches to achieve results. It does not promise you a 1-week result without any effort. But it is perfect for those who have not done much for so many years and want to start. Plus those who have gone through the yo-yo periods of dieting and weight loss programs will also find it useful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E________________________________________________________________________\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EWhat is the proof that it has worked?\u003C/em\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEverything I have spoken to people who have lost weight and continue to maintain their weight I have been fascinated by how they all seem to enjoy the process, look great and confident they can continue. Whenever I have asked how they have arrived at their ideal weight and attitude the response has always been the same; it take long term consistent effort. Here lies one of the big secrets. We used to think some were either born to look trim whiles other were born to be overweight but the truth is that anyone can change the way they look by consistent, action towards a goal. Sooner or later you will get there. Hence, the program detailed in the course is to help you achieve the weight they want by starting with a small habit that will propel you towards the destination you want!

Non-profits are generally funded through charitable donations from companies, individuals, or even governments. Because of this, nonprofits must put a lot of their time in creating compelling reasons for donations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike the term non-profit, the essence of a social enterprise is based within its name itself. A social enterprise is an entrepreneurial venture that is focused on an end goal of creating a positive social and environmental change, as well as a steady revenue.A social enterprise sells a good or service that advances a social, economic, or environmental cause.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESocial enterprises are structured like commercial businesses, with a business model, a consumer base, and revenue streams. These revenue streams go back into the initiatives of the enterprise (apart from the repayment to investors), creating a self-sufficiency in their operations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will give you ideas and suggestions that will reveal the untapped opportunities that you can use to start generating income for your organization.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat Some Of My Students Said:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5 Star Rating: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EBoomy\u0027s lectures are compact, accurate, and to the point.

Did you build a couple of projects with PHP and MySQL, but you still think you are inexperienced and you are missing out on a lot of things when coming to developing bigger projects? If yes, then this course is the right resource for you. This course is very digestible and informative and it was created specifically to enhance your coding skills and knowledge not just in PHP and MySQL, but overall in developing web projects. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is what we are going to do in this course. Naturally, we are going to get started by setting up the right tools for our projects. And after that, we are going to build our first simple yet very interesting project and that\u0027s a payment page with Paypal. The second project will be about a simple forum system. They are going to be also a couple of generic projects like the full CRUD\u0026nbsp;app and so on. After this, the next project will be the starting of something big because it\u0027s an authentication system where I am going to teach you how to develop a login and a register page, how to hash and de-hash passwords, how to do validation and so much more. After this, we are going to build a comments system and this will be the biggest project in this course. We will begin first by doing a post system and then we will grab comments for every post that we have of course we will use Ajax-JQuery for inserting, deleting, and showing comments. after that, we will integrate a rating system into the previous two projects to make a bigger project. So, I will show how to download a JQuery plugin, how to integrate it and how to use it to do the rating system for every post, and so on. And the rating system is going to be implemented of course using Ajax-JQuery.

The Google Ads platform focuses on Pay Per Click (PPC) ads, where advertisers pay per impression on an ad. PPC marketing is a tailorable, affordable form of web marketing, but to succeed, and not waste money, you must take the right approach. Typically it takes many years of experience to gain the in-depth knowledge necessary to get the most out of your PPC campaign.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith this Google Ads course, we aim to get you on the road to success faster, and as long as you are willing to put the work in, and apply our techniques and strategies, you\u0027ll be well equipped with everything you need to succeed. The strength of advertising with Google lies in its massive market reach and the ability it gives you to create highly targeted campaigns. With Google Ads you can drive quality traffic to your brand, garnered from people searching Google for products and services, similar to the ones you\u0027re offering.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo boost your reach, ads from Google often feature across other platforms, including YouTube, Blogger, and the Google Display Network. Another great feature of Google Ads is the Google Ads Analytics dashboard, which allows you to monitor the performance of your ads over time. This helps you hone the effectiveness of your Google Ads and adjust your content and target audience for a more optimal return on your investment. It\u0027s definitely worth investing in Google Ads, as even if you\u0027re ranking well organically, your results are likely to appear lower than those who have paid to promote. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWrite Google ads copy that people love to click on\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want maximum click throughs, you must use copywriting strategies that evoke strong emotion and are targeted to your ideal reader.

When children are initially taught to ask questions, one of the first ones they are taught to ask is \u0022why?\u0022 Even if we are adults today, we will never stop being curious about things. Using empirical approaches, psychologists apply their universal interest to the process of data gathering and interpretation in research, with the ultimate objective of better grasping and addressing some of the most challenging challenges that contemporary society faces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is difficult, if not outright impossible, to think of a facet of life in which psychology does not play a part. There is no area of existence in which psychology does not play a role. The scientific method is something that psychologists employ. This process entails raising a question, offering an explanation for it, and then carrying out thorough experiments in the laboratory or out in the field to support the hypothesis. Psychologists use the information they\u0027ve gleaned from their studies and apply it to the creation of evidence-based practices that may assist in the resolution of problems and the improvement of people\u0027s lives.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ultimate effect of the discipline of psychology research is that it finds new and better ways that people may thrive in an environment that is becoming more complex while still surviving in that setting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Implementation of Scientific Principles\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are several subfields that fall under the umbrella of the subject of psychology. Psychologists do research that is both theoretical and applied, serve as consultants to various communities and organizations, diagnose and treat patients, and teach students who will go on to pursue careers in psychology as well as those who will go on to professions in other disciplines. In addition to judging one\u0027s character, they examine one\u0027s cerebral capabilities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are a significant number of psychologists who work in the medical profession as well. They assess not only the mental but also the behavioral functions, in addition to the health of the individual as a whole. Other subfields of psychology look at the dynamics of human interaction with one another and with technology, with the intention of improving these dynamics via their research.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe use of psychological research has the potential to minimize the financial toll that sickness has on governments and society by teaching people on how to make choices that are good to their own health and well-being. Students that have difficulty grasping new material are able to make better use of the improvements that have been made in educational assessment. It is helpful for educators to get an understanding of how children think, how they process information, and how they remember knowledge since this enables the creation of more effective educational techniques. The discipline of psychological science makes a contribution to the administration of justice by assisting legal authorities in gaining a better understanding of the minds of criminals, evidence, and the limitations of specific forms of testimony or evidence. This contribution is made possible thanks to the fact that psychological science is one of the fields that makes up the field of psychological science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe scientific study of the human mind and behavior is known as psychology. It\u0027s not uncommon to see psychologists holding positions of responsibility inside some of the most famous companies and organizations in the nation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou will find more in this course.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/a-different-look-at-the-science-of-psychology/","imageUri":"https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5062752_a660_2.jpg","duration":"2.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"217.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["This course is useful for everyone from every environment.","Online assignments and readings are available.","Students can study online, but we recommend that you attend classes whenever possible.","Attending online classes improves time management.
