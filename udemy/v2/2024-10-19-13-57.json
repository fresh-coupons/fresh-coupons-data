The sales person must reassure the client that by buying that upmarket product, they are getting better features and benefits that will enhance their experience with the product they just bought. The intelligent sales person is always pointing out how this is good for the customer.

For example, if a customer buys a smart phone, the sales person might suggest a protective case to go along with the phone. The idea is to give the customer peace of mind that their newly purchased product will be protected if the phone is dropped.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDown-selling is about suggesting a lower-priced option when a customer is concerned about the cost of the higher-priced item.

This Microcontroller is called\u0026nbsp;DigiSpark.\u0026nbsp;It is a microcontroller\u0026nbsp;based on the Attiny85 development board. It is similar to Arduino but smaller and more powerful in terms of\u0026nbsp;hacking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstalling backdoors, exfiltrating documents, or capturing credentials is incredibly easy with a seemingly innocent USB drive called the USB\u0026nbsp; Rubber Ducky. An Expert hacker with a few minutes, photographic memory,\u0026nbsp; and perfect typing accuracy can use a few well-crafted keystrokes to hack virtually anything they have physical access to. However, the proper hardware can do the same thing every time on demand without fail.\u0026nbsp; That\u2019s where the Rubber Ducky and other Human Interface Devices (HID)\u0026nbsp; come into play. They inject keystrokes at superhuman speeds, violating computers\u0027 inherent trust in humans by posing as a keyboard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this class, we\u2019ll learn more about what HID attacks are, how they work,\u0026nbsp; the social engineering that can be involved in their deployment, and how to use them in your Pen-testing engagements. Keyboards announce themselves to computers as HID devices and are in turn automatically recognized and accepted. We\u0027ll program a microcontroller in Arduino to take advantage of this by acting as an HID device. We can then create scripts that run when the device is plugged into a target computer. All at only a fraction of the cost of the more well-branded USB Rubber\u0026nbsp; Ducky!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStudents will learn to use a low-cost Digispark to program their payloads for use in Ethical Hacking and Penetration testing. We\u0027ll go over creating more advanced loads, including tracking payloads that run in the background, as well as Rickroll payloads that can be used with permission from friends and family to demonstrate how HID attacks work. Additionally, students learn to automate nearly anything on an unattended device which can be extremely useful when you need to run the same commands on a series of computers.\u0026nbsp; That\u2019s how the Original USB Ruber Ducky was invented. Hak5 founder\u0026nbsp; Darren Kitchen, while working as a sysadmin, got tired of typing the same commands to fix printers and network shares, again and again, and the device evolved out of laziness. He programmed a development board to emulate the typing for him - and thus the keystroke injection attack was born.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0647\u0644 \u0635\u0646\u0627\u0639\u0647 \u062C\u0647\u0627\u0632 \u0631\u0627\u0628\u0631 \u062F\u0643\u064A\u061F\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u062F\u0639\u0646\u0627 \u0646\u062A\u0639\u0631\u0641 \u0639\u0644\u0649\u0026nbsp;

It involves leveraging digital technologies such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence, data analytics, Internet of Things (IoT), and others to streamline processes, enhance customer experiences, and drive innovation. Digital transformation isn\u0027t just about adopting new technologies; it\u0027s about reimagining business models and processes to stay competitive in the digital age.  Digital Business Development: Digital business development focuses on utilizing digital technologies and strategies to expand a company\u0027s reach, improve its products or services, and increase revenue streams. It involves activities such as digital marketing, e-commerce, online partnerships, and digital product innovation. Digital business development aims to capitalize on the opportunities presented by the digital landscape to grow the business and create new value for customers.","Unit economics is a fundamental concept in business that focuses on understanding the direct revenues and costs associated with a particular business model or product at a per-unit level. These \u0022units\u0022 can be customers, orders, products, or any other relevant metric. Analyzing unit economics helps companies and experts assess the sustainability and profitability of their operations.  Here\u0027s why learning about unit economics is crucial for both experts and companies:  Sustainability and Profitability Assessment: Unit economics provide a clear view of whether a business is sustainable and profitable. By examining the revenue generated and the costs incurred on a per-unit basis, experts and companies can evaluate if they are making money or losing it with each sale or customer acquisition.  Scaling Decisions: Understanding unit economics is vital for making informed decisions about scaling a business. If the cost to acquire a customer is higher than the revenue generated from that customer over time, it may not be sustainable to scale the business without making changes.  Business Model Optimization: Unit economics analysis allows experts and companies to identify areas for optimization. It helps in finding cost-effective ways to acquire and retain customers, reduce operational costs, and increase average revenue per unit.  Investor Confidence: For startups and growing companies, demonstrating positive unit economics is often essential to attract investors. It shows that the business model is sound and has the potential for long-term profitability.  Risk Management: By understanding unit economics, companies can identify potential risks early. If the per-unit cost is too high, it may lead to financial instability or bankruptcy in the long run.  Pricing Strategies: Unit economics are key in setting appropriate pricing for products or services. Companies can determine the right balance between pricing and costs to maximize profitability.  Strategic Decision-Making: Business decisions related to product development, marketing campaigns, and resource allocation should be guided by a deep understanding of unit economics. It helps in focusing resources on high-impact areas.","Developing skills related to unit economics can be highly beneficial for building a career in various fields, including business, finance, and entrepreneurship:  Entrepreneurship: Entrepreneurs who understand unit economics can create and refine business models that are more likely to succeed.

It is suitable for software developers who want to learn how software works internally and also for reverse engineers who want to fix bugs where the source code is not available. Traditionally, we use tools like x64dbg, OllyDbg for reverse engineering and debugging. Howevever, those tools have their limitations as they rely on file patching to modify program behaviour. But what if the files could not be patched. Here Cheat Engine shines. Cheat Engine is a memory hacking tool. It is used by Gamers to hack games in order to cheat. Cheat Engine\u0027s main strength is its memory scanning, code injection, or process patching. This course will equip you with the knowledge and skill to use Cheat Engine in addition to whatever other tools you might already be familiar.

In this section students also learn to work with metadata presets, and preferences related to import options. Once students have a handle on the foundations, the course takes an in-depth look into file formats and color space. Here, we demonstrate the importance of understanding various image compression types and the quality vs size trade off. We discuss RAW vs JPEG vs TIFF files, along with color space comparisons between sRGB, RGB and CMYK. Students also learn the concept of image resolution and the importance of pixel density in determining image quality.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn section three, we complete our overview of the Lightroom interface by showcasing a few more essential features.
