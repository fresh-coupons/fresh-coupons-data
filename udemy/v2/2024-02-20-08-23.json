The price you achieve for your products and services will be the price of the best alternative plus the differentiation value you create and effectively communicate to potential buyers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo maximise profits, therefore, you need to identify those elements of your products and services that appeal to the customer and work to enhance them, eliminating any negative factors. Creating such differentiation value in your products and services, and requires understanding of Value Drivers versus the competition This course will show you how.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this course we describe a method for setting prices for your products and services that maximise your profitability by aligning precisely with the markets you are targeting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn essence the method is to ask yourself why customers would want to use your business rather than another? Then you compare your offering with those of competitors in the marketplace and pitch your pricing to show the value of the benefits that you offer customers \u2013 whether it be quality or service or speed of response and so on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in the course include:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00B7 The dangers of cost-plus pricing\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00B7 What is customer value?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00B7 The elements of customer value\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00B7 Measuring customer value\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00B7 The eight-step pricing strategy\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00B7 Practical Pricing Strategies\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00B7 Maintaining your Pricing Policy\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe course is aimed at small and medium sized enterprises, but the key elements and tools can be applied to organisations of all sizes.

Motivation and Engagement: Well-defined performance goals have a motivational effect on employees.

They can enhance job satisfaction and increase employee commitment to the organization.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Performance Evaluation: Performance goals serve as a basis for assessing employee performance.

Objective evaluation criteria linked to performance goals ensure fairness and transparency in the assessment process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Skill Development: Performance goals create opportunities for employees to develop and enhance their skills and competencies. By setting goals that require employees to stretch beyond their current capabilities, organizations can foster a culture of continuous learning and development. Employees are motivated to acquire new knowledge, acquire relevant training, and seek growth opportunities to meet or exceed their goals. This, in turn, benefits both the individual and the organization by building a skilled and capable workforce.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Alignment with Organizational Objectives: Performance goals play a crucial role in aligning individual and team efforts with the broader organizational objectives.

Accountability and Performance Improvement: Performance goals create a sense of accountability among employees. When employees have clear goals and know they will be evaluated based on their performance, they are more likely to take ownership of their work and strive for excellence. Goals also provide a basis for identifying performance gaps and areas that require improvement. Managers can offer support, guidance, and resources to help employees overcome challenges and enhance their performance.","Performance goals are a vital component of effective human resource management. They provide clarity, motivation, and focus for employees, facilitate performance evaluation and skill development, align individual efforts with organizational objectives and foster a culture of accountability and continuous improvement. By recognizing the importance of performance goals, organizations can drive employee engagement, productivity, and ultimately, achieve their desired outcomes."],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":143,"averageValue":"4.3"},"instructors":[{"name":"MTF Institute of Management, Technology and Finance","url":"/user/mtfinstitute/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.3007517}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"DB2F8B74BC6DA751E39D","originalPrice":"\u20B93,499","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"3 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/css-javascriptphp-and-python-programming-all-in-one-course/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4359810,"title":"CSS, JavaScript,PHP And Python Programming All in One Course","shortDescription":"Learn CSS with Javascript, PHP And Python Programming Language All in One Course","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003ELearn CSS and Javascript and PHP And Python all in one complete course \u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003Esection 1- CSS course with basics and advanced concepts of CSS\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eever wonder how the latest website designs are made?

We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables.
