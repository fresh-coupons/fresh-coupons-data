A course for anyone who wants to build career in IT and Software Development","DevOps  What it is: DevOps is a set of practices and a cultural philosophy that automates and integrates the processes between software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) teams. It emphasizes communication, collaboration, and shared responsibility to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.  Key Concepts:  Automation: Automating tasks like building, testing, and deployment.  Continuous Integration (CI): Frequently integrating code changes into a central repository.  Continuous Delivery (CD): Automating the release pipeline to ensure code can be rapidly and reliably deployed to production.  Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Managing infrastructure in a declarative manner, often using code, to automate provisioning and management.  Monitoring and Feedback: Continuous monitoring of applications and infrastructure to identify and address issues quickly.","Version Control  What it is: Version control systems (like Git) record changes to files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.  Benefits:  Collaboration: Multiple developers can work on the same codebase without conflicts.  History Tracking: See the complete history of changes, who made them, and when.  Rollback: Revert to previous versions if needed.  Branching and Merging: Experiment with new features without affecting the main codebase.","CI/CD  What it is: CI/CD is a set of practices that enable rapid and reliable software delivery through automation.  Key Components:  Continuous Integration (CI): Developers integrate code changes frequently, triggering automated builds and tests.  Continuous Delivery (CD): Extends CI by automating the release pipeline, ensuring code is always ready for deployment.  Continuous Deployment: A step further where every change that passes automated tests is automatically deployed to production.","Why These Approaches Are Important  For Companies:  Faster Time to Market: Deliver new features and updates more quickly.  Improved Quality: Reduce errors and improve software stability through automation and continuous testing.  Increased Efficiency: Automate repetitive tasks, freeing up developers to focus on innovation.  Reduced Risk: Smaller, more frequent releases make it easier to identify and fix problems.  Better Collaboration: Improve communication and collaboration between development and operations teams.  For IT Managers and Developers:  Career Advancement: DevOps skills are in high demand, making professionals more valuable.  Increased Productivity: Automation and streamlined workflows allow for greater focus on meaningful work.  Improved Job Satisfaction: Reduced stress and greater ownership of the development process.  Enhanced Collaboration: Work more effectively with colleagues across different teams.

It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables.
