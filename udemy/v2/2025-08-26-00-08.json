In other words, machine learning algorithms can recognize patterns and make predictions based on data, without getting a command. This enables computers to learn new tasks and improve their performance over time without human intervention.","Where is Machine Learning used?  Machine learning is in use by a wide range of applications, including email filtering, Social Media Personalization, Image Recognition, Speech Recognition, fraud detection, Text prediction, Product recommendation, medical diagnosis, Healthcare Personalization, Traffic Prediction.","Neural networks are a type of machine learning algorithm that is inspired by the structure and function of the human brain.  Neural networks can learn complex patterns from data.  Neural networks have been successfully used in areas such as natural language processing.","Deep Learning is a type of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers.  Each layer consists of multiple nodes that can perform diverse tasks. This allows deep learning models to learn more complex patterns from data.  Deep learning has been used to achieve significant results in a wide range of tasks, including image recognition, speech recognition, and machine translation."],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":853,"averageValue":"4.2"},"instructors":[{"name":"MTF Institute of Management, Technology and Finance","url":"/user/mtfinstitute/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.258197}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"146B0D99C1380145B564","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"15 hours","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/cold-email-cold-emailing/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4021158,"title":"Email Marketing with Dekker: Cold Email Marketing \u0026 More!","shortDescription":"Udemy Email Marketing (Unofficial): Cold Email Marketing, Email Writing \u0026 Business Development | Email Marketing","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EMaster high-performing email marketing for B2B, B2C \u0026amp; ecommerce in this Udemy email marketing course!

In this course:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E- High concentration of useful material in each lesson\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESometimes you can notice that watching 5 minutes of our lesson is equivalent to watching other 30 minutes lessons. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is because time spent for preparation for the lesson (script for the lesson, lesson structure) and video editing (to cut boring pieces of the lesson or time when the program loads) sometimes \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E10 times as much (sometimes even 20)\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E as the final lesson duration after video editing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly your homework and coding exercises including the EXAM\u0026nbsp;task might take approximately 20 hours to implement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, each topic is separated from another.

The information which is shared there is very old and significantly out of date. For example, the instructor teaches a framework which is not been used already for 15 years. Or instructors do stress on the programming design which is not used anymore at all!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe instructor of this course is a consultant in a top-rated IT\u0026nbsp;outsourcing company and helps to bring cutting-edge solutions in IT for all his clients. Feel free to check the LinkedIn page of the instructor and check skills endorsement. More than 18 thousand people across all over the world (BTW\u0026nbsp;most of them are from the top 100 companies of the world) evaluated the skills of Andrii Piatakha. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith this course, you can be sure that you will spend your time learning the right things from one of the best IT\u0026nbsp;consultants in the world. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E- Sequence of lessons\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter the years of teaching offline, and based on the feedback of students who are passing online courses we realized how important the sequence of lessons is while teaching Java. The same issue is with the books where information is completely unstructured what makes things even more complex. For example, how students can learn object-oriented programming from the first lesson if they don\u0027t know yet the java syntax basics?\u0026nbsp;Or how a student can implement a home task if he/she doesn\u0027t aware of java methods specifics, or doesn\u0027t know yet how to read program input?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in this course, you can be sure, that you will not get a home task to implement without having enough information to implement it. The program which is in this course is proven by many students who completed it offline and now work as software engineers in outsourcing companies and as freelancers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E- Interview practice tests\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/strong\u003EBeing an IT consultant in different companies, the tutor of this course was in charge of driving the interview process in companies to make sure, that company selects the best people. That\u0027s why the first interview is always test. In case the test is completed, the candidate is invited to have a conversation. That\u0027s why in this course we want to prepare you to complete tests successfully! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEspecially for our students, we prepared tests that could be used to evaluate their knowledge during the interview process. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 tests. 90 questions each \u003Cstrong\u003E(180 interview tests in total). \u003C/strong\u003E120 minutes each.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can read explanations for answers!

You also need to have a lot of practice. In this training course, you will have different practical tasks which will help you learn and understand Java better. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the key tasks where you can practice your knowledge is the implementation of a backend system for an online store. Also, you have a lot of tasks that use domain-specific terminology:\u0026nbsp;accounts, transactions, users, carts, menu, services, etc. So that means you are learning programming without abstract concepts like it is written in the books or in other courses. You learn domain-specific terminology and during the lessons, we investigate specific extracts from code that can give you a clear vision of how you can apply the knowledge in real life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo don\u0027t wait!

A successful manager is now expected to act as a leader, a mentor, and a coach, guiding their team members towards individual and collective success. This paradigm shift highlights the significance of coaching techniques in the realm of managerial responsibilities.","The Transformation of Managerial Roles  Evolving Leadership Expectations  The traditional image of a manager as a stern authority figure has given way to a more holistic view of leadership. Managers are now expected to serve as role models, motivators, and mentors to their teams. This shift stems from the recognition that employees perform at their best when they feel valued, supported, and empowered.  The evolution of leadership expectations can be traced back to the changing dynamics of the modern workplace. In the past, managers were primarily responsible for enforcing rules and ensuring productivity. However, as organizations began to realize that employee engagement and satisfaction were crucial for success, a transformation in managerial roles ensued.  Today, managers are not just tasked with overseeing tasks and projects; they are expected to inspire and empower their teams. This shift is partly a response to the changing nature of work itself. In a knowledge-based economy, where creativity, innovation, and adaptability are paramount, traditional top-down management no longer suffices.","Coaching as a Leadership Skill  Coaching has emerged as a pivotal leadership skill that fosters personal and professional growth. We\u0027ll explore how coaching techniques, such as active listening, constructive feedback, and goal-setting, can empower managers to become effective leaders who inspire and guide their teams towards excellence.  Coaching is not a one-size-fits-all approach; it is a dynamic and personalized method of leadership. Effective coaches adapt their style to the needs and preferences of individual team members. They actively listen to understand the unique challenges and aspirations of each employee, fostering a sense of trust and rapport.  Moreover, coaching is not merely about providing solutions but guiding employees to discover answers themselves. This approach instills a sense of ownership and accountability in team members. It encourages them to take the initiative, think critically, and develop problem-solving skills\u2014a valuable asset in today\u0027s fast-paced, ever-changing business landscape.

This heightened emphasis on career development places managers at the forefront of helping their team members chart their professional journeys. Coaching knowledge equips managers with the ability to provide guidance that is not only aligned with the organization\u0027s needs but also tailored to the aspirations of individual employees.  One of the key advantages of coaching in career development is its ability to facilitate self-awareness. Effective coaches help employees identify their strengths, weaknesses, interests, and values.
