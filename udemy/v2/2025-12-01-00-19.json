Collaboration: Git facilitates seamless collaboration among multiple developers working on the same codebase. Developers can work on different features concurrently, merge their changes, and resolve conflicts in a controlled manner.  Code Safety: Git acts as a safety net, allowing developers to experiment without fear of irreparably damaging the codebase. Branches and commits provide isolation for new features or bug fixes.","Command Line Proficiency: Understanding Git commands empowers developers to execute precise actions and troubleshoot issues effectively.  GUI Fluency: Graphical interfaces like those in GitLab and GitHub simplify common Git operations, making it more accessible for beginners and streamlining workflows.  Platform Compatibility: Familiarity with both GitLab and GitHub ensures adaptability across different development environments and collaborative projects.  Foundation for Growth: This introductory knowledge lays the groundwork for further exploration of Git\u0027s capabilities and advanced features.  Confidence Building: Mastering the basics empowers developers to contribute to projects and collaborate effectively, boosting confidence and engagement.  Industry Standard: Git is a ubiquitous tool in software development. Proficiency is essential for career advancement and employability.","Benefits for Enterprise Software Development  Enhanced Collaboration: Git facilitates effective communication and coordination among large teams, promoting efficient development and reducing bottlenecks.  Improved Code Quality: Version control, code reviews, and branching strategies contribute to higher code quality and fewer bugs.  Accelerated Development: Git\u0027s features, such as branching and merging, enable parallel development and faster release cycles.  Streamlined Onboarding: New developers can quickly get up to speed by accessing the project\u0027s Git repository and understanding its history.  Reduced Risk: Git\u0027s safety net and version control minimize the risk of code loss or corruption, protecting valuable intellectual property.","Git proficiency is indispensable for modern software developers and plays a vital role in driving successful software development at enterprise companies. Investing in Git training and fostering a culture of collaboration around Git practices yields significant benefits in terms of productivity, code quality, and overall project success."],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":899,"averageValue":"4.1"},"instructors":[{"name":"MTF Institute of Management, Technology and Finance","url":"/user/mtfinstitute/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.195531},{"name":"Nikolai Priakhin","url":"/user/nikolai-priakhin-2/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.195531}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"0140BE733427E85AC2E7","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"2 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/business-science-method-analysis-research-methodologies/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":6142065,"title":"Business \u0026 Science Method, Analysis \u0026 Research Methodologies","shortDescription":"Introductional course, Usage of Research and Analytical Methodologies in Business and Science","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWelcome to course: Business \u0026amp; Science Method, Analysis \u0026amp; Research Methodologies by MTF Institute\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECourse provided by \u003Cstrong\u003EMTF Institute of Management, Technology and Finance\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMTF\u003C/strong\u003E is the global educational and research institute with HQ at Lisbon, Portugal, focused on business \u0026amp; professional hybrid (on-campus and online) education at areas: Business \u0026amp; Administration, Science \u0026amp; Technology, Banking \u0026amp; Finance. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMTF R\u0026amp;D \u003C/strong\u003Ecenter focused on research activities at areas: Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Data Science, Big Data, WEB3, Blockchain, Cryptocurrency \u0026amp; Digital Assets, Metaverses, Digital Transformation, Fintech, Electronic Commerce, Internet of Things. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMTF\u003C/strong\u003E is the official partner of: IBM, Intel, Microsoft, member of the Portuguese Chamber of Commerce and Industry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMTF \u003C/strong\u003Eis present in 210 countries and has been chosen by more than 520 000 students.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECourse Author:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECristiana Silva \u003C/strong\u003Eis a senior education technician with 4 years\u0027 experience in coordinating pedagogical and social projects in Higher Education Institutions and Private Social Solidarity Institutions.

As of October 2019, the Colaboratory UI only allows for the creation of notebooks with Python 2 and Python 3 kernels; however, an existing notebook whose kernelspec is IR or Swift will also work, since both R and Swift are installed in the container.
