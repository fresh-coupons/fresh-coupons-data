We start right from the ground up, where students will learn to navigate the Lightroom interface, create image catalogs and import hundreds of images for the purpose of sorting and organizing photo collections. Here we will explore important concepts such as catalog settings, import file handling, auto renaming, metadata presets, and import preferences. Once students are familiar with the basics, we take a theoretical dive into a number of concepts and key terms that are essential in the photography and digital image editing arena. Here we will explore various file formats, color spaces, image resolution, pixel density, and much more. From there, we transition back to completing application setup by exploring file handling options, interface preferences, identity plate setup, and watermarking with both text and graphics.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOnce we\u2019ve covered the foundations, students will take a deep dive into the Lightroom Library Module. The library module is an integral part of the Lightroom application, which is used for a number of important functions. This includes populating, sorting, and organizing image collection sets. This section starts from the basics, where we explore the Library interface. From there, students learn to filter files, paint keywords, and generate keyword sets. We\u2019ll also demonstrate how to use various library views for image comparison, and advanced sorting. Once students have a handle of the foundations, we cover more intermediate sorting techniques using star ratings, pick and reject flags, color labels, and smart collections. We then transition to working with the library attribute filter, adding folders, building smart previews, and an overview of the quick develop panel for basic image enhancements.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAs you can see this course covers a number of topics that are essential to anyone starting off in the digital image enhancement arena.

(All the Books of the Bible) That passion drew me to seriously consider his engaging presentation. The instructor challenged me to see myself through the eyes of my Lord and Savior - not the eyes of the world! I learned many valuable teachings about the Book of Philippians by taking this course. That is a credit to the instructor preparing a very detailed and organized course that is easy to follow. The course provided me the opportunity to reflect on my walk with the Lord, and my lack of commitment to thoroughly read and learn from God\u0027s written word on a daily basis. I will never find my true path (God\u0027s will for my life) if I remain a lukewarm Bible studying believer in the Lord, Jesus Christ! It is impossible for a born again Christian to seldom study the Bible, pray without ceasing or draw closer to God in a reconciled relationship while following the secular world. This course has reignited the fire that once was within me to learn from the Bible daily. I praise the Lord for Boomy Tokan who followed the Holy Spirit\u0027s prompting in preparing and sharing this course. I look forward to taking the other courses that Boomy has prepared.

Perform Stunning Image Enhancements.","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EThis course offers a comprehensive guide for students interested in learning how to effectively use the Lightroom develop module to perform enhancements on individual photos or image collections. The course starts from the foundations, where we explore the Lightroom Classic CC interface, and setting up an image catalog. Here, students will learn to configure a catalog and a number of other application preferences, such as import file handling and metadata. From there, we dive into image file formats where students are introduced to a number of key terms relevant to both photography and image retouching. Students will learn the importance of file formats, color spaces, image resolution, pixel density, and the notorious RAW file. We also explore file handling options, interface preferences, identity plate setup and watermarking with both text and graphics.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOnce students are familiar with accessing the various interface components to perform a multitude of image sorting and organization tasks, we dive into one of the most powerful features of Lightroom: The Develop Module. Here students will start with exploring the Develop module interface along with the preset, and history panel.

Well, the answer is actually pretty obvious, it\u0027s one of the best AI text to image generator that exist, however, there is much more than that, due to the fact that Midjourney got rid of its free trial couple weeks ago, therefore, at the time I am creating this course it will cost you at least 10 dollars to use MidJourney. As the consequences, it is definitely not surprising at all to see many people are actively looking for free alternatives to Midjourney, hence, this is exactly when Leonardo AI comes into place as it has the same quality if not slightly better than Midjourney but even until today Leonardo AI still gives free access to its user with pretty generous limit which is 150 images per day for completely free.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow are things that you will learn in this course:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow AI text to image generator works from technological perspective\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow to write effective prompts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExploring all features on Leonardo AI dashboard\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETraining datasets for our own model on Leonardo AI\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExploring Fine Tuned Models available on Leonardo AI\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFull step by step tutorial on how to generate Image on Leonardo AI\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGenerating image using our own trained dataset models\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImage to image generation\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComplex prompt generation\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow to use AI canvas to combine images\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow to create AI talking portrait using D-ID\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/leonardo-ai-mastery-create-cool-ai-arts-talking-portraits/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5343630_362e.jpg","duration":"3 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"57.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["People who are interested to learn more about Leonardo AI","People who are interested to create hyper realistic talking portraits"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":0,"averageValue":"0.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"Christ Raharja","url":"/user/christ-raharja/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":0}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"4BD153C8F42951A6BA07","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"\u20B9449","expirationText":"5 hours","discountPercentage":44}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/arduino-programming-using-python/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5039842,"title":"Arduino Programming using Python","shortDescription":"You can learn programming using the Python programming language in an Arduino course.","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EAre you interested in learning how to program using Python and Arduino?
