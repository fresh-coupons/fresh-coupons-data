He makes every other course seem like a prologue and I know I am going to be the confident, well prepared speaker that I always sought to become. The magnitude of material and the pieces of golden wisdom are so practical to today\u0027s environment. It hardly seems possible that a teacher of this quality would be so giving and available to the average person like myself, when he is qualified to coach Kings and Dignitaries. Only one-third through the course and already my Charity fundraising efforts are more effective because I have gained skills to improve my communication, both my message and my delivery. The clarity of TJ Walker\u0027s delivery demonstrates his message in action. Follow him on Facebook and YouTube for greater depth if you find yourself improving from absorbing his work as I have. Do the assignments promptly and you will improve with each session. Worth the investment of time and that is what I value most, TJ WALKER delivered value with each session, and made the most of my time.\u0022\u0026nbsp;Debbie Tudor\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat others say about the instructor:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u201CTJ Walker\u0027s single-minded devotion to presentation has made him the #1 expert for executives seeking guidance on speaking to the public and media.\u0022 \u003Cem\u003EBob Bowdon, Anchor/Reporter, Bloomberg Television\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u201CTJ Walker is the leading media trainer in the world.\u0022 \u003Cem\u003EStu Miller, Viacom News Producer\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(TJ Walker\u0027s Media Training Worldwide) \u201CThe world\u0027s leading presentation and media training firm.\u0022\u003Cem\u003EGregg Jarrett, Fox News Channel Anchor\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/how-to-deliver-an-elevator-pitch/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/364026_36eb_2.jpg","duration":"10 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"26,199.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Entrepreneurs ","Job seekers","Executives"],"tags":["Communication Skills","Investor Pitching","Personal Branding"],"rating":{"count":191,"averageValue":"4.6"},"instructors":[{"name":"TJ Walker","url":"/user/tjwalker2/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.529851},{"name":"Media Training Worldwide Digital","url":"/user/media-training-worldwide-digital/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.529851}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"5A17E0504207F9F87FD8","originalPrice":"\u20B92,299","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/media-training-for-financial-service-professionals/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":364206,"title":"Media Training for Financial Service Professionals","shortDescription":"Media Training to look great on CNBC and get the quotes you want in the Wall Street Journal","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMedia Training\u003C/strong\u003E.\u0026nbsp;Imagine you are appearing on CNBC and you are the perfect image of confidence and insight, or a profile of you is on the front page of the Wall Street Journal and every quote is exactly as you planned.

So he is giving us an actual example of the very thing that he is talking about. His expressions and gestures are perfectly suited to the points he is making. And his pronunciation is very clear and easy to understand. Also his sentences are spoken with the emphasis in the right places. This course is designed for native speakers of English. The same basic principles could probably be applied in a course designed for non-native speakers. I would like to see such a course someday. I am really enjoying this course.
