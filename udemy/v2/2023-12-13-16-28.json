The goal is for the model to learn a mapping function that can predict the output for unseen inputs accurately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eb) Unsupervised Learning: Unlike supervised learning, unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data. The algorithm\u0027s objective is to find patterns and structures in the data without explicit guidance. Clustering and dimensionality reduction are typical tasks in unsupervised learning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ec) Reinforcement Learning: This type of learning is inspired by behavioral psychology, where an agent interacts with an environment and learns to take actions that maximize rewards or minimize penalties.

The data should be representative of the problem you want to solve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eb) Data Preprocessing: This step involves cleaning the data, handling missing values, and transforming the data into a suitable format for training the models.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ec) Feature Engineering: Selecting and creating relevant features from the data is an essential part of building effective machine learning models.

CSR is about how corporations manage the business practices to generate an overall positive impact on the society. CSR policy would ideally function as an integrated, self-regulating mechanism whereby companies would monitor and ensure their support to ethical standards, law, and international norms. As a result, companies would accept responsibility for its activities\u2019 impact on the environment, employees, consumers, stakeholders, and communities. Additionally, CSR-focused organizations would proactively advance the public interest by promoting community growth and development, as well as voluntarily abolishing practices that harm the community. Basically, CSR is the intentional inclusion of public interest into business decision-making.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECorporate social responsibility courses include many elements, but in general, it is what companies do to help others or the environment. Many years ago companies were only interested in their profit margin and keeping their shareholders happy. These days many have come to understand that for the greatest sustainability, employees, customers, the general community and the environment are all important.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey realize that if they are seen to be polluting the environment, for instance, they will get a bad reputation that will impact on their standing in the community and perhaps even their end profits. But if they are seen to be doing something to protect the environment then the man in the street will accept and embrace them, thus creating an element that is even more important than short-term profits, viz. sustainability and popularity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is not only about the environment of Corporate Social Responsibility courses, but also taking care of people \u2013 employees or the general public, or both. After all, in many cases, it is the general public who makes or breaks a company, especially if they are selling products or providing services. If a company develops such a bad reputation for greedy profit at the expense of people, their sales will go down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo this end, there must be corporate volunteering to do the right thing because as yet there are no laws to enforce corporate social responsibility courses. Business volunteers will find that establishing ethical behaviors in the business is not so hard once they get into it and volunteering overseas is particularly rewarding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVolunteering for a leadership development program is one good way to start as you can then Corporate Social Responsibility courses learn what needs to be done in this area and develop actions to carry your plans through. Even within the company, there will be many ways in which such ethics can be implemented to give employees the support they need. It might be as simple as ensuring that the workplace is safe, or beginning a program to help employees that may be addicted to the company\u2019s product.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECorporate Social Responsibility Courses as well as Training Descriptions\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIntroduction to the Corporate Social Responsibility\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA strategy of CSR \u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInternal as well as External Communication of CSR\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPR Channels of the Corporate Social Responsibility\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReporting, Measurement as well as Certification Processes in CSR\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECSR for all Executive Officers\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrends in Ethical Behavior as well as Social Responsibility\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESustainable Tourism of CSR\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe preamble to Microfinance in the Developing World\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEngagement throughout Social Media\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEthical Sourcing of the Executive Workshop\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECertificate in Accounting for the Carbon Emissions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClimate Change as well as Carbon Footprinting of CSR\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESustainability Reporting of the Training Course\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWaste Management as well as Resource Efficiency Course\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/corporate-social-responsibility-strategy-csr/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5615316_5492.jpg","duration":"3.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"1,717.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["The Common audiences, The Employees, The Customers/consumers, The Local community, The Media, The Consumer associations","The Suppliers, The Business partners, The Investors, The General public, The Trade unions, Public authorities as well as regulators","The Local organizations or institutions, The Not-for-profit or the non-governmental organizations, The Prospective employees, The Aboriginal communities"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":3,"averageValue":"5.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"EDUCBA Bridging the Gap","url":"/user/premananda-suna/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":5}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"EDUCBADEC12","originalPrice":"\u20B91,699","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/montessori-education-montessori-teacher-training-kids-teaching-skills/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5336848,"title":"Master Course in Montessori Teacher Training 2.0","shortDescription":"Montessori  Education, Montessori teacher training, Early childhood education, Kids Teaching skills, Special Education","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EMaster course in Montessori\u0026nbsp; Education and Montessori teacher training 2.0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are a lot of parents who come to proper education because they hear about their Montessori program.

Operational risk is the risk of losses caused by flawed or failed processes, policies, systems or events that disrupt business operations. Employee errors, criminal activity such as fraud, and physical events are among the factors that can trigger operational risk. Most organizations accept that their people and processes will inherently incur errors and contribute to ineffective operations. In evaluating operational risk, practical remedial steps should be emphasized to eliminate exposures and ensure successful responses.

According to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, small and midsize companies suffer more losses due to fraud than their larger counterparts. Experts estimate that companies lose 5% to 6% of their annual revenue to fraud, so every company should have a comprehensive fraud prevention program. A fraud prevention program is not difficult to implement. It simply consists of education, investigation, and proactive prevention policies. Since employees are the most likely to report issues or any fraudulent activities, you certainly want to give them both the knowledge and the tools to help your company weed out any instances that may be taking place. And while fraud prevention efforts are designed to stop employee fraud, note that any investigations of suspected instances of fraud or employee theft may also act as a deterrent to other employees who may be either committing or contemplating fraud. The bulk of your company\u0027s fraud prevention efforts should be focused on the creation and implementation of proactive preventive techniques. This includes establishing internal controls and putting into place policies and procedures that are specifically designed to prevent fraud. One of the best ways to develop prevention policies may include utilizing an experienced anti-fraud professional. Make sure to find one who is experienced and has investigated numerous instances in order to help you to develop the most relevant and most effective anti-fraud controls.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/corporate-fraud-regulations-control/","imageUri":"https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5621770_4bfa.jpg","duration":"2 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"1,907.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Bankers, Accountants, Stakeholders of a company, Anyone who wants to learn about fraud control"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":5,"averageValue":"4.3"},"instructors":[{"name":"EDUCBA Bridging the Gap","url":"/user/premananda-suna/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.4}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"EDUCBADEC12","originalPrice":"\u20B91,999","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/zero-trust-architecture/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5259730,"title":"Master Course in Zero Trust Architecture 2.0","shortDescription":"Zero Trust Architecture, Cyber security, Network security, Microsoft, Oracle, IBM Zero Trust Architecture, MFA Security","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EMaster course in Zero Trust Architecture 2.0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat is Zero Trust Architecture?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EZero trust is when security policy is applied based on context established through least-privileged access controls and strict authentication, not assumed trust.

Rather than rigid network segmentation, software-defined microsegmentation protects your data, workflows, services, and such anywhere, in your data center or distributed hybrid or multicloud.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy using a network-centric data security strategy that provides specific access only to those who need it, Zero Trust Architecture focuses on the business needs and functionality of an organization. By enabling parameters to dictate access and restrictions, the Zero Trust model views data security from a whole new perspective. As opposed to legacy networks that have little to no visibility or control over network and data usage, Zero Trust Architectures see all network traffic through segmentation gateways with granular policies governing access to data, apps, and assets. There are certain rules that have to be followed before a resource can be accessed in a Zero Trust network.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe five major topics I want to cover in this master\u0027s course are\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

For example, if there is a rise in temperature it will also lead to a rise in the sales of ice creams. This is called positive correlation. Correlation analysis deals with relationship among variables. The correlation coefficient lets researchers to measure if there is a possible linear relationship between two variables measured on the same subject. The values of the correlation coefficient are always between -1 and \u002B1. There are different types of correlation coefficients used for different situation. The most common is the Pearson correlation coefficient.

Traditional ways to succeed no longer work and you have to look beyond them to achieve greater success. Leading is an important trait that can be used in development of an organization. To initiate decisions that are translated in to concrete actions can be done only by true leaders who can fore see all kinds of situations. Managers must guide and motivate their people to achieve newer heights and become an asset to the company. A leader must direct, influence and motivate employees to perform essential tasks. At times of emergency, every manager must act as a leader to overcome business crisis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA good leader guides, instructs and motivates his fellow assistants and helps them work better. The skills, effectiveness and capacity of a great leader depend on how he manages his subordinates in times of crisis. He should work together along with other co workers to benefit the organization he is working in.Great leaders have the capacity to influence the subordinates in a positive way and get the work done in lesser time with the collective efforts of each employee. Leadership qualities are necessary in each individual, especially in people who are in managerial positions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EManagerial leadership can be seen in different dimensions in the modern day organizations.

Dictating is never encouraged while inspiring and empowering are still considered the best way to get work done from the employees.

Here we show you why it is so important for companies, how it works in principle and how companies can implement it in practice. Investors, lenders, and managers all look to a company\u0027s financial statements using liquidity measurement ratios to evaluate liquidity risk. This is usually done by comparing liquid assets\u2014those that can easily be exchanged to create cash flow\u2014and short-term liabilities. The comparison allows you to determine if the company can make excess investments, pay out bonuses or meet their debt obligations. Companies that are over-leveraged must take steps to reduce the gap between their cash on hand and their debt obligations. When companies are over-leveraged, their liquidity risk is much higher because they have fewer assets to move around. Almost five years since the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the start of the global financial crisis, the global economy continues to feel the aftershocks. Policymakers continue to grapple with the policy response. The start of 2013 saw tail risks recede in the global economy, thanks to policy actions in the U.S. and euro area. While financial market conditions have improved markedly across the board for the last half year or so, the real economy continues to lag. We still are not seeing the levels of growth needed to drive a real global recovery, and we are not generating the jobs needed for the millions who have fallen into unemployment over the past five years.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/global-economic-crisis-liquidity-management/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5621730_1d0d.jpg","duration":"3 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"1,621.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Bankers, Accountants, People wanting to make a career in commercial Banks, Anyone who wants to learn about how risk management takes place in banks"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":7,"averageValue":"4.3"},"instructors":[{"name":"EDUCBA Bridging the Gap","url":"/user/premananda-suna/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.357143}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"EDUCBADEC12","originalPrice":"\u20B91,999","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/predictive-analytics-model-for-term-deposit-investment-in-r/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5630260,"title":"Predictive Analytics Model for Term Deposit Investment in R","shortDescription":"Learn Predictive Analytics Model using R from a case study","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EPredictive analytics is an emerging strategy across many business sectors and they are used to improve the performance of the companies.

It provides us with the list of services and various tools which are required for building the Mobile User Interface with the native feel and the same look. The ionic framework needs to have a native wrapper interface using which it will be able to run the ionic based applications on mobile devices. Moreover, it can be known to be the front-end based HTML framework which comprises many front end languages, and therefore it is built on top of the possibly best front end framework, AngularJS, and Cordova. It is an HTML5 based Mobile Application development framework which is targeted at building mobile-based hybrid apps. Ionic can be thought of as a front end UI framework that is used to handle the basic look and feel and the User interface based interactions that are required for the app to be compelling. It is somewhat like Bootstrap for native applications that are built for the support of a broad range of common and basic native mobile-based components, beautiful design, and slick animations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe features would include AngularJS based Model View Controller architecture for creating and building rich SPAs also known as Single Page Applications particularly optimized for the device and mobile-based devices. Other features would include CSS components that come along with the native look and feel and are used to provide all the elements which are typically required by a mobile-based web application. The default styling of the components can be easily overridden which can accommodate their designs. The JavaScript components extend the CSS component capabilities and also Javascript related functions and their capabilities to cover the mobile elements which cannot be only done with HTML and CSS. Other features include the ones related to Cordova plugins that offer the API related to the usage of the mobile-based native device functions with JavaScript code. The Ionic CLI is a NodeJS based utility which is powered by the various commands required for building, starting, running as well as emulating ionic applications. The views are a very useful platform that is required for sharing, uploading, and testing your applications for native devices.

CART is a predictive algorithm used in Machine learning and it explains how the target variable\u2019s values can be predicted based on other matters. It is a decision tree where each fork is split into a predictor variable and each node has a prediction for the target variable at the end. Classically, this algorithm is referred to as decision trees, but on some platforms like R they are referred to by the more modern term CART. The CART algorithm provides a foundation for important algorithms like bagged decision trees, random forest and boosted decision trees.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs the name suggests, CART (Classification and Regression Trees) can be used for both classification and regression problems. The difference lies in the target variable. That is, With classification, we attempt to predict a class label. In other words, classification is used for problems where the output (target variable) takes a finite set of values, e.g., whether it will rain tomorrow or not. Meanwhile, regression is used to predict a numerical label. This means your output can take an infinite set of values, e.g., a house price.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDecision Trees are an important type of algorithm for predictive modeling machine learning. The classical decision tree algorithms have been around for decades and modern variations like random forest are among the most powerful techniques available. In this post you will discover the humble decision tree algorithm known by it\u2019s more modern name CART which stands for Classification And Regression Trees. The web is full of apps that are driven by data. All the e-commerce apps and websites are based on data in the complete sense. There is database behind a web front end and middleware that talks to a number of other databases and data services. But the mere use of data is not what comprises of data science. A data application gets its value from data and in the process creates value for itself. This means that data science enables the creation of products that are based on data.

This algorithm generates the outcome as the optimized result based upon the tree structure with the conditions or rules. The decision tree algorithm associated with three major components as Decision Nodes, Design Links, and Decision Leaves. It operates with the Splitting, pruning, and tree selection process. It supports both numerical and categorical data to construct the decision tree. Decision tree algorithms are efficient for large data set with less time complexity.

An IPO allows a company to raise equity capital from public investors. The transition from a private to a public company can be an important time for private investors to fully realize gains from their investment as it typically includes a share premium for current private investors. Meanwhile, it also allows public investors to participate in the offering.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first step in the IPO process is for the issuing company to choose an investment bank to advise the company on its IPO and to provide underwriting services. Underwriting is the process through which an investment bank (the underwriter) acts as a broker between the issuing company and the investing public to help the issuing company sell its initial set of shares. After the IPO is approved by the SEC, the effective date is decided. On the day before the effective date, the issuing company and the underwriter decide the offer price (i.e., the price at which the shares will be sold by the issuing company) and the precise number of shares to be sold. Deciding the offer price is important because it is the price at which the issuing company raises capital for itself. After the issue has been brought to the market, the underwriter has to provide analyst recommendations, after-market stabilization, and create a market for the stock issued. The final stage of the IPO process, the transition to market competition, starts 25 days after the initial public offering, once the \u201Cquiet period\u201D mandated by the SEC ends.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/fund-raising-through-ipos-and-fpos/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5621716_e72a.jpg","duration":"3 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"1,501.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Students and Professionals"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":5,"averageValue":"4.4"},"instructors":[{"name":"EDUCBA Bridging the Gap","url":"/user/premananda-suna/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.6}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"EDUCBADEC12","originalPrice":"\u20B91,999","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/bayesian-statistics-bayesian-model-for-healthcare-testing/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5633400,"title":"Bayesian Statistics - Bayesian Model for Healthcare Testing","shortDescription":"Learn to solve statistical problems using Bayesian Statistics and MS Excel","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EBayesian statistics is a particular approach to applying probability to statistical problems. It provides us with mathematical tools to update our beliefs about random events in light of seeing new data or evidence about those events. Bayesian statistics is an approach to data analysis based on Bayes\u2019 theorem, where available knowledge about parameters in a statistical model is updated with the information in observed data. The background knowledge is expressed as a prior distribution and combined with observational data in the form of a likelihood function to determine the posterior distribution. The posterior can also be used for making predictions about future events. In particular Bayesian inference interprets probability as a measure of believability or confidence that an individual may possess about the occurance of a particular event.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMachine learning is a scientific discipline that explores the construction and study of algorithms that can learn from data.

initial stage, which is theoretical lectures, then moving to the second stage, which is a practical session from a certified lecturer at the College of Computers and Information, which begins with you step by step in building a strong mentality towards the field of programming and gradually building methods for writing code in the C language in an effective way. In the lecture, we explain the basic theoretical details, in addition to having a practical application for them, then proceed with a practical application session that teaches you ways of thinking and how to apply what you have learned in what is called logical thinking, and apply it in code simply on the code editor, with all the explanation files, codes, and files for the session deliverables.
