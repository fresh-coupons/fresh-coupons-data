Whilst we might have a good grasp on our own feelings, we may not approach them in the right way. For example, feelings of grief and anger are often repressed, meaning they only show themselves in unexpected outbursts, which isn\u2019t healthy for yourself or the people around you. On top of that, not a lot of people are good at registering the emotions of their peers. This can lead to a loss of social connection, and potentially isolate you from others.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this course, we will teach the fundamentals of how to develop emotional intelligence and how you can use the science of emotions to better comprehend what someone is feeling at a certain point in time.

This gives you the necessary skill set not only to read other people\u2019s emotions but manage yours in a healthy way. This allows you to embrace everything you feel, rather than letting it manifest into difficulties further down the line.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhilst this course is primarily a stepping stone for understanding your emotions, it is also a source of self-help, allowing you to embrace uncertainty and the feelings that accompany it.

These concepts might seem alien to you now, but soon they\u2019ll be excellent tools and tricks you will be integrating within your marketing methodology to correctly maximise sales potential for your company.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhilst this course is mainly tailored for sales executives and business owners looking to develop sales methodologies in an uncertain marketing climate, it is perfect for anyone in the sales industry, especially those who want to learn the key to selling with integrity and confidence.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/maximising-sales-in-an-economic-decline/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/3673552_d939_3.jpg","duration":"2 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"8,150.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Businesses or individuals selling a product to customers in unprecedented market conditions","Professionals looking to form a marketing methodology to maximise sales potential","Business owners looking to increase conversion and promote profitable growth","Professionals in sales/commercial support roles that want to know how to sell more in an increasingly competitive market","Anyone wanting to learn how to sell with integrity and confidence"],"tags":["Management Skills","Sales Skills","Sales Management"],"rating":{"count":114,"averageValue":"4.6"},"instructors":[{"name":"Expert Academy","url":"/user/expert-academy/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.652174},{"name":"Lahcen Bouya","url":"/user/lahcenbouya/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.652174}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"3CCA8C6AFBF5E0270340","originalPrice":"\u20B91,699","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/java-se-desde-cero-a-pro/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4209902,"title":"Java desde Cero: vu\u00E9lvete profesional en este lenguaje","shortDescription":"Aprende uno de los lenguajes m\u00E1s demandados del mundo desde cero conociendo Java SE (Standard Edition).","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EEste es un \u003Cstrong\u003Ecurso de lenguaje de programaci\u00F3n Java\u003C/strong\u003E, el cual inicia desde cero en lo relativo a dicha tecnolog\u00EDa, pero no es un curso de programaci\u00F3n b\u00E1sica.
