It is the practical application of what you have learnt in the first course. If you think that packing and anti-debugging is good enough to prevent reverse engineering, then you may be in for a surprise. In this course, I\u0026nbsp;will show you how to test the effectiveness of several popular packers by packing crackmes and then reversing them - \u003Cstrong\u003Ewithout unpacking. \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETraditionally packed programs are unpacked before debugging is carried out. This is because a packed program\u0027s file cannot be patched. Much of software protection has centered on making it difficult to unpack programs. However,\u0026nbsp; the important question is: how effective is packing, obfuscation and anti-debugging as a means to prevent reversing? This course explores several packers to find the answers. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe will do the analysis using a tool called Cheat Engine, which is a prominent tool used by game hackers. This tool could also be used to study and analyze packed program\u0027s processes that is running in memory. You will learn how to perform debugging in spite of anti-debugging being implemented. There is no need to unpack and dump memory.\u0026nbsp; Instead of unpacking and then patching the dumped files and fixing IAT (Import Address Table) tables,\u0026nbsp; we will write scripts to hack memory using byte patching using an advanced technique called AOB (Array-Of-Bytes) Injection, by injecting code into code caves (inline memory patching).\u0026nbsp; In this course you will learn how to do all of the above and more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the end of this course you will be able to gauge the effectiveness of software packers, obfuscation and anti-debugging protection and also to have a good idea of how to implement extra countermeasures to improve the security of software.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn all the practical exercises and walkthroughs, we will use Crackme\u0027s which I\u0026nbsp;have written.

It also allows the packet-based information and authentication to take place and also makes use of the multicast for Internet protocol when either sending or receiving any packet\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis course module named Routing Protocols RIP and EIGRP is quite similar to the one used above and is also responsible to teach you many basics and fundamental concepts such as those related to troubleshooting, operation, and configuration. The two most important routing protocols which will be explained in detail are the RIP also known as Routing information protocol and the other is EIGRP which is the abbreviated form for Extended interior Gateway protocol. In the RIP protocol, the oldest of the vectors for distance IP Routing protocols are still put to use and thereby getting various enhancements. There are currently two versions that exist for the RIP viz. RIPv1 and RIPv2. RIPv1 is also said to be the classful protocol which means that it is not classless whereas if you talk about the RIPv2, it is considered to be the classless support routing protocol and IPv6 is the one whose support is extended to RIPv2 with the next-gen RIP which is also termed as RIPng. EIGRP, on the other hand, is related to the Interior Gateway protocol as it is a proprietary protocol of the company CISCO. This protocol is occasionally described as the distance vector routing protocol which also acts and imitates like a link state-oriented protocol. Distance vector-based protocols share everything of which they are aware of. The only limitation they carry is that the amount of information shared is only among the neighbors which are directly or indirectly connected with each other. Link state-based protocols announce that the information present is only about the direction and not indirectly connected links. However, they are also responsible to share the routing protocol information among themselves in all the areas they deem fit among all the routes in their domain or area.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/cisco-ospf-hands-on-certification-training/","imageUri":"https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4844382_3644_3.jpg","duration":"10.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"6,024.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["The target audience for this course is anybody who has a keen interest in the field of digital communication and is also aware of how the basics of understanding the networks and other routing protocols and mechanisms such as OSPF Routing.

Two fundamental principles of Islamic banking are the sharing of profit and loss and the prohibition of the collection and payment of interest by lenders and investors. In Islamic banking, the banks do not collect interests from creditors. Instead, they earn money using equity participation systems and share profits and losses. Islamic finance is practiced in many Muslim countries and is extremely popular among Islamic communities, as some conventional banking practices might be against Shariah. Islamic finance is considered more ethical than conventional banking, as it believes that a bank and its clients should make profits and losses together. Hence, it does not just focus on maximizing the bank\u2019s wealth. Also, Islamic finance practices consider the best interests of the Muslim community.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIslamic banking development can be attributed to some conventional banking theories and practices which go against and hurt the sentiments of the Muslim communities. Hence, Islamic finance was developed by inventing methods that are Sharia-compliant. Sharia is the Islamic law present in the Quran\u2019s teachings. Creating practices that align with the Muslim culture and beliefs encourages many to take up banking. Islamic finance is so strictly followed that banks look to religious leaders and scholars for guidance. The main objective of Islamic banking\u003Cstrong\u003E \u003C/strong\u003Eand finance is that all society participants should create wealth and benefit. Usually, in conventional banking, some parties benefit at the expense of others.

think, behave and relate to each other \u201Cmore than the human world\u201D ( Dr Abram). This is true in the organizational setup when coaches and mentors are required not only to expand their individual and collective capacity for responding to the current requisite needs of the company, but also to increase the human capacity for fulfilling the increased demands of tomorrow. However, there is a critical relationship between the coaches or mentors and the team members, and often the conversation between the two ends up getting worse, which could be due to the differences in their expectations and lack of the control on one\u2019s emotions. A leader has to display his capability as the coach, but at the same time he ought to be mentoring and it is vice-a-versa. After all, the main purpose of coaching and mentoring is to increase the knowledge and skills as per the organizational setup but it all depends upon the way it is delivered, making it critically imperative to understand the difference between the two terms.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExplore the purposes of coaching and mentoring and recognize how they differ.

The Coach has to assist the person to learn the requisite skills, attitude and behavior for performing the work successfully and within the set parameters. All the tasks are precisely described with essential details, clear focus and in specific timelines while mentoring goes much beyond the conventional work structure to focus on the individual\u2019s emotional and behavioral aspects. During the mentoring process, the interaction could be more philosophical, psychological and emotional with the individual as the whole criteria are taken into the perspective.
