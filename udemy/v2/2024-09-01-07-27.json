Modern chatbots are typically online and use generative artificial intelligence systems that are capable of maintaining a conversation with a user in natural language and simulating the way a human would behave as a conversational partner. Such chatbots often use deep learning and natural language processing, but simpler chatbots have existed for decades.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"Hindi","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/chatbot-development/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/6105187_d55c_3.jpg","duration":"2 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"950.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Beginner","Fresher","Corporate employee training"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":6,"averageValue":"4.8"},"instructors":[{"name":"Ganesh Kadam","url":"/user/ganesh-kadam-20/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.75}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"1B116B4FB0146804769B","originalPrice":"\u20B91,499","discountedPrice":"\u20B9449","expirationText":"5 hours","discountPercentage":70}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/master-class-on-datascience/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5272092,"title":"2024 Master class on Data Science using Python A-Z for ML","shortDescription":"Python NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn for Data Analysis, Data Science and ML.
