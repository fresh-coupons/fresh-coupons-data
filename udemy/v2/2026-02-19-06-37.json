Medical genetics differs from human genetics in that human genetics is a field of scientific research that may or may not apply to medicine, while medical genetics refers to the application of genetics to medical care. For example, research on the causes and inheritance of genetic disorders would be considered within both human genetics and medical genetics, while the diagnosis, management, and counselling people with genetic disorders would be considered part of medical genetics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn contrast, the study of typically non-medical phenotypes such as the genetics of eye color would be considered part of human genetics, but not necessarily relevant to medical genetics (except in situations such as albinism). \u003Cem\u003EGenetic medicine\u003C/em\u003E is a newer term for medical genetics and incorporates areas such as gene therapy, personalized medicine, and the rapidly emerging new medical specialty, predictive medicine\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMedical genetics\u003C/strong\u003E encompasses many different areas, including clinical practice of physicians, genetic counselors, and nutritionists, clinical diagnostic laboratory activities, and research into the causes and inheritance of genetic disorders. Examples of conditions that fall within the scope of medical genetics include birth defects and dysmorphology, intellectual disabilities, autism, mitochondrial disorders, skeletal dysplasia, connective tissue disorders, cancer genetics, and prenatal diagnosis. Medical genetics is increasingly becoming relevant to many common diseases. Overlaps with other medical specialties are beginning to emerge, as recent advances in genetics are revealing etiologies for morphologic, endocrine, cardiovascular, pulmonary, ophthalmologist, renal, psychiatric, and dermatologic conditions.

This course delves deeper than just teaching you how to say a simple greeting or basic nouns; it actually aims to get you engaged and involved in speaking and writing in the language as soon as your first day through interactive video lessons and lectures, and resources only available to students in this course. In this course, you also won\u0027t be bogged down by overly complex technical lingo or terminologies, nor will you learn things that don\u0027t apply to most Spanish learners (as is often taught in a classroom setting). So, whether you have no prior experience with Spanish, know a decent amount, or are just looking for a refresher, this is an essential course for you, as it\u0027s made for those who want to actually get started on confidently holding conversations in\u0026nbsp;Spanish and feeling comfortable breaking through the barrier of their Spanish knowledge by going beyond rote memorization. Whether you want to improve your Spanish skills in one area, know nothing at all, or want to go back to basics, this course covers multiple bases of the Spanish language, such as speaking, reading, writing, listening, and more.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-spanish-now/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4067814_b5da_11.jpg","duration":"5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"59,277.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["People who want to learn Latin American Spanish","Spanish language learners","Language learners"],"tags":["Spanish Language"],"rating":{"count":360,"averageValue":"4.3"},"instructors":[{"name":"John Cordova","url":"/user/john-cordova-12/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.48}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"MIDFEB26","originalPrice":"\u20B92,699","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/master-wordpress-by-building-sites-in-hindi/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":6951999,"title":"Master WordPress by Building 7 Sites \u002B AI Techniques (Hindi)","shortDescription":"Learn WordPress by Building Real Websites \u002B AI Techniques","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EAre you ready to \u003Cstrong\u003Emaster WordPress from scratch\u003C/strong\u003E and build \u003Cstrong\u003Ereal, professional websites\u003C/strong\u003E?

DNA template is denatured to single strands.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. DNA primer (with 3\u2019 end near sequence of interest) is annealed to \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe template DNA and extended with DNA polymerase.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Four reactions are set up, each containing:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. DNA template\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Primer annealed to template DNA\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.

Next, a different radio-labeled dideoxynucleotide (ddATP, ddTTP, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EddCTP, or ddGTP) is added to each of the four reaction tubes at \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1/100th the concentration of normal dNTPs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. ddNTPs possess a 3\u2019-H instead of 3\u2019-OH, compete in the reaction with \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enormal dNTPS, and produce no phosphodiester bond.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Whenever the radio-labeled ddNTPs are incorporated in the chain, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDNA synthesis terminates.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Each of the four reaction mixtures produces a population of DNA \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emolecules with DNA chains terminating at all possible positions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. Extension products in each of the four reaction mixutes\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ealso end with a different radio-labeled ddNTP\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(depending on the base).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9.

Automated DNA sequencing employs the same general \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eprocedure, but uses ddNTPs labeled with fluorescent dyes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Combine 4 dyes in one reaction tube and electrophores in \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eone lane on a polyacrylamide gel or capillary containing \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Epolyacrylamide.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. UV laser detects dyes and reads the sequence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5.

It assumes that you\u0027re new to the language, so it gets you started with basic functionality such as creating functions, creating variables, and calling these lines of code from your standard HTML pages. It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables.

HR professionals can gain insights into how improving one area can positively impact the other, leading to a more integrated approach to workforce management.","5. Practical Application:  A combined course can provide practical tools and frameworks that address both employee relations and engagement. For example, a module on conflict resolution might not only teach how to resolve disputes but also how to turn those resolutions into opportunities for increasing employee engagement.","6. Organizational Culture and Performance:  The course can help participants understand how both employee relations and engagement contribute to building a positive organizational culture. A strong culture, in turn, enhances performance, reduces turnover, and makes the organization a more attractive place to work.  In summary, discussing employee relations and employee engagement together in one online course provides a more complete understanding of how to create a positive, productive, and motivated workforce. By learning about both areas in tandem, HR professionals can develop strategies that support a healthy work environment and drive organizational success."],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":222,"averageValue":"4.5"},"instructors":[{"name":"MTF Institute of Management, Technology and Finance","url":"/user/mtfinstitute/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.58}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"CB1EFB71A43B8F0FCF9D","originalPrice":"\u20B91,339","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"2 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/prisma-orm-fundamentals/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":6802763,"title":"Prisma ORM Crash Course for Web Developers","shortDescription":"Using Prisma and TypeScript for type-safe database operations","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMaster Prisma ORM \u2013 From Setup to Relations\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPrisma is one of the most powerful and developer-friendly ORMs for TypeScript and Node.js, making database access type-safe, intuitive, and efficient.
