Here, you will learn how to deploy fully scalable React web apps on some of the most powerful cloud computing platforms available, including AWS and Linode. The course starts with exploring the foundations of cloud computing where we dive into a comprehensive overview of the three main cloud service models. This includes: Infrastructure as a Service, Platform as a Service, and Software as a Service. From there we offer an in-depth guide to deploying and configuring virtual instances and the foundations of remote server administration and server security using SSH. Students are then introduced to Linux, where we explore various Linux distributions, the Linux filesystem, and essential Linux maintenance and directory commands. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOnce students have a handle on working with Linux, we\u2019ll dive into the foundations of Web Servers. Here, we\u2019ll explore two industry leaders in the server software space including Apache and NGINX. Students will learn the benefits and use cases of each server technology, combined with an in-depth technical analysis of their performance in production environments. From there we\u2019ll explore database management systems, including both SQL and NoSQL databases, coupled with database transaction standards. In this section students gain valuable insights into a variety of different database options available, and the best use case for each depending on the project type and complexity. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWith a firm handle on the theoretical aspects of web servers and DBMSes, we jump into a practical guide to setting up LAMP stack on Ubuntu through terminal for MacOS and PuTTY for Windows. Here we configure Linux with Apache, MariaDB, and PHP. Students will also learn how to upload data to a MariaDB database, and fetch records from within PHP scripts. The course then takes a theoretical and practical deep dive into server security. Here, we explore both network and hosted firewalls. We emphasize the pitfalls of lax server configurations, and provide a step-by-step guide to enabling and setting up UFW for Ubuntu. Students will also learn how to configure custom ports for SSH tunneling as an added layer of security.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe second half of the course provides a comprehensive guide to Amazon Web Services. We start with demonstrating how to setup, secure, and navigate an AWS account. This includes setting up billing alerts and multi-factor authentication. From there, we take a deep dive into AWS Identity and Access management for enhanced account security, and the management of user accounts for various AWS services. Here we explore IAM User management and permissions, IAM Groups, IAM Policies, and access key rotation. Following the IAM section, we\u2019ll jump into the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) service. In this module students lean to deploy virtual instances on AWS using Amazon Machine Images, Elastic IPs, and Launch Templates. We will also explore IAM roles for EC2, EC2 Security Groups, SSH key pair authentication, and remote administration using both terminal and EC2 Instance connect. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAfter students have a mastery of cloud computing, the next segment explores the development and deployment of interactive web apps using both JavaScript and React. Here we start with JavaScript foundations including the document object model, and DOM manipulation. From there, we hop into JavaScript variables, arithmetic operations, data types, objects, arrays, loops, functions, and events. The JavaScript section concludes with two hands-on projects where students build a background color changer, and photo gallery. After completion of the JavaScript section, students will use their new found skills to build out dynamic front-end UI components using the React JS library. Through a series of hands-on projects, students will build a calculator, Connect-4 Game clone, and a fully customizable e-commerce site. The react modules start from the basics and work up to several intermediate level concepts. This includes: working with code pen, JSX, Functional components, Props, Callbacks, Events, the React State hook, conditional rendering, Fetch API, Refactoring, and much more. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAs you can see this course covers a tremendous bit of ground. Best of all it\u2019s co-authored by Tim Maclachlan - a renowned senior full-stack developer with over 20 years of commercial development experience. As a multi-faceted developer, Tim specializes in algorithmic, analytical and mobile development. To date, he\u2019s written hundreds of applications and worked in a number of industries from commercial aviation and military, to banking and finance. Tim has a genuine passion for teaching others how to become better coders and looks forward to interacting with his students.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWith that said, we hope you\u2019re just as excited about this course as we are, if so - hit that enroll button and let\u2019s get started.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-javascript-react-deploy-web-apps-on-the-cloud/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4874962_431f.jpg","duration":"25 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"30,922.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Students interested in the Foundations of Cloud Computing including Cloud Service and Deployment Models","Students interested in working with Powerful Cloud Computing Platforms including AWS and Linode","Students interested in learning the Foundations of Linux and the Ubuntu Linux Distribution","Students interested in installing and configuring LAMP Stack on a remote Virtual Instance","Students interested in the Foundations of Web Server technology including Apache and NGINX","Students interested in the Foundations of Database Management Systems (DBMS), including SQL and NoSQL databases.","Students interested in administering cloud servers using AWS","Students interested in learning about AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)","Students interested in deploying and configuring Amazon EC2 Instances","Students interested in learning the Foundations of JavaScript Coding \u0026 DOM manipulation","Students interested in building interactive front-end UI\u0027s using React JS"],"tags":["Cloud Computing","JavaScript","React JS"],"rating":{"count":107,"averageValue":"4.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"YouAccel Training","url":"/user/youaccel/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.3333335}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"YOUACCEL87836","originalPrice":"\u20B91,999","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"3 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-guide-to-the-metaverse/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4932376,"title":"Become Metaverse Master: The Ultimate Guide To The Metaverse","shortDescription":"7 Quick and Easy Steps That Will Make You a Confident Player, Creator \u0026 Investor in This New Reality","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E*** This course comes with custom-made English captions ***\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*** GET\u0026nbsp;STARTED\u0026nbsp;WITH\u0026nbsp;THE\u0026nbsp;METAVERSE\u0026nbsp;Section Updated For\u0026nbsp;2023! ***\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*** NEW LECTURE!

Below are some reasons why you should learn Deep learning in R\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\t1. It\u2019s a popular language for Machine Learning at top tech firms. Almost all of them hire data scientists who use R. Facebook, for example, uses R to do behavioral analysis with user post data. Google uses R to assess ad effectiveness and make economic forecasts. And by the way, it\u2019s not just tech firms: R is in use at analysis and consulting firms, banks and other financial institutions, academic institutions and research labs, and pretty much everywhere else data needs analyzing and visualizing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\t2. Learning the data science basics is arguably easier in R. R has a big advantage: it was designed specifically with data manipulation and analysis in mind. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\t3. Amazing packages that make your life easier. Because R was designed with statistical analysis in mind, it has a fantastic ecosystem of packages and other resources that are great for data science. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\t4. Robust, growing community of data scientists and statisticians. As the field of data science has exploded, R has exploded with it, becoming one of the fastest-growing languages in the world (as measured by StackOverflow). That means it\u2019s easy to find answers to questions and community guidance as you work your way through projects in R.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\t5. Put another tool in your toolkit. No one language is going to be the right tool for every job. Adding R to your repertoire will make some projects easier \u2013 and of course, it\u2019ll also make you a more flexible and marketable employee when you\u2019re looking for jobs in data science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat is the difference between Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPut simply, machine learning and data mining use the same algorithms and techniques as data mining, except the kinds of predictions vary. While data mining discovers previously unknown patterns and knowledge, machine learning reproduces known patterns and knowledge\u2014and further automatically applies that information to data, decision-making, and actions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDeep learning, on the other hand, uses advanced computing power and special types of neural networks and applies them to large amounts of data to learn, understand, and identify complicated patterns.

It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are practicals of:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E* Javascript Course Contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Array\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Variables\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Functions\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Objects\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Control Statements\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Cookies\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Loop statements\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESee you inside the course\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-practicals-crash-course/","imageUri":"https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4200228_c917_2.jpg","duration":"38 total mins","enrolledStudentsCount":"92,543.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["For Javascript  Programming Beginners","For People New to Javascript","For People Who want to learn Javascript Fundamentals and later Transition into Web Development"],"tags":["JavaScript"],"rating":{"count":1034,"averageValue":"4.1"},"instructors":[{"name":"PROPER DOT INSTITUTE","url":"/user/vivek-dahibhate-2/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.132353}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"E92E51D1CB953573D7C5","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"3 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/sql-in-hindi/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4528234,"title":"SQL for Data Analytics in Hindi -

In this course, you will learn how to effectively manage and optimize your storage on Amazon Web Services (AWS). This includes a comprehensive overview of the main forms of EC2 storage offered by AWS, including Elastic Block Store (EBS), Elastic File System (EFS), and Amazon Machine Images (AMI).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe course starts with the foundations of AWS, where we demonstrate how to register an AWS account. Students also learn the basics of AWS billing, global vs. regional services, and AWS multi-factor authentication (MFA). \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOnce students are familiar with navigating the AWS dashboard, we dive into working with the EC2 service. Here we explore the core features of EC2 instances, along with instance deployment, instance administration, and security. Students will learn how to create and deploy instances from Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) that are fully equipped with Elastic IP addresses, and remote access via terminal and PuTTY. We also cover a host of other integral concepts including IAM roles for EC2, Security Groups, and EC2 Instance Launch Templates. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAfter the EC2 section, we delve into AWS EC2 storage solutions. Here, we start with exploring the key differences between block, file, and object storage. From there, we take a deep dive into Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS). EBS is a block storage service provided by AWS which allows for the creation of virtual disks, called EBS volumes that can be attached to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances. These EBS volumes can be used as raw block devices, in order to store data, such as system files, application data, and virtual machine images. We will cover how to create, attach, and manage EBS volumes, as well as how to use EBS Snapshots to create point-in-time backups of your data. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EFrom there, we explore Amazon Machine Images (AMIs), which are templates that contain the software configuration and data required to launch an EC2 instance. We will cover how to create and customize AMIs, as well as how to use the EC2 Image Builder to automate the creation of AMIs. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn the last section, we introduce students to the Elastic File System (EFS), which is a file storage service provided by AWS. EFS allows you to create a file system that can be accessed by multiple EC2 instances to store and share files across multiple availability zones. We will cover how to create and manage EFS file systems, as well as how to mount EFS file systems on your EC2 instances. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EBy the end of this course, you will have a solid understanding of the various storage options available on AWS, and you will be able to confidently choose the right storage solution for your needs. You will also have the skills and knowledge to effectively manage and optimize your storage on AWS, ensuring that your data is safe, secure, and accessible.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIf you\u2019re excited about learning everything you need to know about AWS EC2 storage, hit the enroll button and let\u2019s get started.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/master-amazon-ec2-storage-complete-guide-for-ebs-efs-ami/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4925150_1295.jpg","duration":"5.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"12,558.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Students interested in Cloud Computing with AWS","Students interested in learning the foundations of Amazon Web Services","Students interested in Mastering the Amazon EC2 Service","Students interested in Mastering EC2 Storage Solutions: ELB, EFS, AMI"],"tags":["Cloud Computing","AWS Config"],"rating":{"count":24,"averageValue":"4.8"},"instructors":[{"name":"YouAccel Training","url":"/user/youaccel/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.75}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"YOUACCEL87836","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"3 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/chatbot-marketing-course/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4651160,"title":"Grow your business with Chatbot Marketing!","shortDescription":"Hands-on guide to Chatbot Marketing for beginners.

React, also known as React JS, is a powerful JavaScript library used for building custom, interactive user interfaces using UI components. Some of the most well known examples of organizations using React for their front-end include Netflix, Facebook, and Airbnb. Developed and maintained by Meta along with a community of independent developers, React remains free and open-source. React is a component based library built entirely on JavaScript, which makes it perfect for designing complex UI\u2019s. With React, developers can build encapsulated components that efficiently manage their own state and render UI updates specifically when data changes. For example, think of the automated content refresh feature you see on a twitter feed, or facebook like button. Here the state of the UI component changes on the page, without having to manually refresh when the data is updated. This is just one small, yet powerful feature of React.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThrough a complete hands-on project, this course will teach you all the fundamental principles of React that you must know to become a proficient React developer. We start right from the basics, including the tools needed to get started. From there we dive into JSX, functional components, props, callbacks, and various OnClick events. By this stage, the calculator will have a complete visual display, coupled with functional arithmetic operations. Students then move on to passing parameters in Callback functions, using the React State Hook, and debugging.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn addition to the hands-on React module, we also offer a comprehensive overview of JavaScript for those who need a refresher. Here we start with introducing students to the document object model (DOM) which defines the logical structure of HTML documents. From there we dive into JavaScript to demonstrate various methods in which DOM elements can be manipulated to add interactivity to static components. We start right from the basics, which includes JavaScript placement, and data output. From there we move on to variable declaration, arithmetic operations, operator precedence, data types, and objects. Once the foundations are covered, we move on to more complex operations using Arrays, Conditional Statements, JavaScript comparison operators, booleans and loops. Here students will learn to unleash the true power of JavaScript to render different outcomes based on user interaction. We will explore the use of functions to efficiently handle repetitive tasks and JavaScript events to handle output based on actions and occurrences. The section will conclude with a hands-on project where students will implement their knowledge to build a web based photo gallery and background color changer. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAs you can see this course covers a tremendous bit of ground.

In the RIP protocol, the oldest of the vectors for distance IP Routing protocols are still put to use and thereby getting various enhancements. There are currently two versions that exist for the RIP viz. RIPv1 and RIPv2. RIPv1 is also said to be the classful protocol which means that it is not classless whereas if you talk about the RIPv2, it is considered to be the classless support routing protocol and IPv6 is the one whose support is extended to RIPv2 with the next-gen RIP which is also termed as RIPng. EIGRP, on the other hand, is related to the Interior Gateway protocol as it is a proprietary protocol of the company CISCO. This protocol is occasionally described as the distance vector routing protocol which also acts and imitates like a link state-oriented protocol. Distance vector-based protocols share everything of which they are aware of. The only limitation they carry is that the amount of information shared is only among the neighbors which are directly or indirectly connected with each other. Link state-based protocols announce that the information present is only about the direction and not indirectly connected links. However, they are also responsible to share the routing protocol information among themselves in all the areas they deem fit among all the routes in their domain or area.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/cisco-ospf-hands-on-certification-training/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4844382_3644_3.jpg","duration":"10.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"8,534.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["The target audience for this course is anybody who has a keen interest in the field of digital communication and is also aware of how the basics of understanding the networks and other routing protocols and mechanisms such as OSPF Routing.

Minitab, as the software is capable of data analysis, pattern detection through statistics, data crunching. Most of the calculation is automated, and graphs are generated as per the functionality required by the analyst working on the use cases. For this course specifically, we would be exploiting the use of Minitab for Time Series Analysis and Forecasting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, let us understand what time series analysis is. Time series data is a collection of data over some time or interval. The data when captured over time typically might have some internal structure, for example, autocorrelation, trends, seasonality, stationarity, and many such fundamentals. For example, let us think about the sales of umbrellas or raincoats. We can see that in the selling of these items we might encounter a seasonality aspect, that they might be sold high during the onset of the rainy season. Also, we can see that the data itself might auto-correlate itself to the promos that might have been set by some stores, online or offline, and many more such intricate detailing through the understanding of time series analysis fundamentals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow when we know how to analyze the time series it becomes pretty evident that what exactly to do with the studies or hypothesis we developed as a part of the study. The answer lies in prediction! We would understand the fundamentals through historical time series data and then utilize that deep insight to predict or forecast for the future. In this way, we would be able to capture the historical trends and seasonality and utilize them to have a better insight into what\u2019s in store in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis course is a collection of well-crafted tutorials or topics we would naturally go about if we must fully understand the topic of time series analysis and forecasting.

This will take you through different types of GUI interfaces and help in a detailed explanation of building a button in a GUI. we would create a windows application wherein we would first learn to set up the mainframe and then build on to that for creating a guest list page and a check-in page. Finally creating page having guest by room numbers and their receipts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPython GUI is one of the various toolkits present with Python and this toolkit focusses on developing GUI (Graphical User Interface). Now since python GUI is very specific to Python, let us look at what GUI essentially means, and then we may be able to jump into understanding specifically Python GUI. GUI or in other words, Graphical User Interface is a form of a connection tool through which users would be able to interact with electronic devices. This interaction is through the use of buttons and graphical icons which makes it visually appealing for users to use and the software behind the icons removes the robotic coding required to perform the particular task. The intention of the introduction of GUI is thought to reduce the commands that need to be typed at the command-line interface (CLI) through keyboard and that exactly what task it does!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow coming to Python GUI, let us say, for example, we would need to run a code in python, a .py file through the command line. We would create a simple GUI which might have a button \u201CRun\u201D and once a user clicks on that the python file which intends to run will automatically get selected and will run. What Python GUI would do essentially is remove the unnecessary coding part of running the python file through CLI. Not only this there are other plausible features Python GUI provides and that\u2019s exactly what you would go through in this course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring the training and post completion of the training, one would imbibe skills to take on more daring challenges in professional life. This course will also allow you to grasp the business intelligence required to be that handful of developers in Python GUI. This training will also give you a glimpse of the security concerns one faces in the real-world and, also allow you to think about how we can take care of those concerns. This Python GUI Course will also help you in getting the frame of mind to design the visual components and understand the temporal behavior of building the GUI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you complete the course you would b able to appreciate the enhancement of efficiency through the use of GUI, and the ease of use of the logical design of the program underlying in the design. With the completion of the course you would be able to bring in modularity in any GUI application you would build along with enhancing the usability perspective of GUI. This training is not restricted to just the theoretical part, but we enhance the use of theoretical concepts in the playground of real-life projects giving you an upper hand in establishing the relation of the concept and using them in real life. We ensure that no stone will be left unturned to make you the best python GUI developer organizations are looking for. Just choose a unit test framework that your organization would demand, a test runner, an IDE and we assure that you would be good to go in leaping in the professional world.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/python-gui-training-program-for-gui-development/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4719338_de52.jpg","duration":"3 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"5,027.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["The courses we conduct online never restricts the audience we expect to reach to.
