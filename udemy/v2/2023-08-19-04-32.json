It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are practicals of:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E* Javascript Course Contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Array\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Variables\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Functions\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Objects\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Control Statements\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Cookies\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Loop statements\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESee you inside the course\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-practicals-crash-course/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4200228_c917_2.jpg","duration":"38 total mins","enrolledStudentsCount":"88,075.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["For Javascript  Programming Beginners","For People New to Javascript","For People Who want to learn Javascript Fundamentals and later Transition into Web Development"],"tags":["JavaScript"],"rating":{"count":967,"averageValue":"4.1"},"instructors":[{"name":"PROPER DOT INSTITUTE","url":"/user/vivek-dahibhate-2/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.1287427}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"83C6E1248F4281289C02","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-c-programming-course-for-beginners/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":2968672,"title":"The Complete C Programming Course for Beginners","shortDescription":"C Programming: The Fundementals of C Programming Language from Ground UP with Illustrated \u002B Hands on Coding Expalanation","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to \u003Cstrong\u003E\u0027The Complete C Programming Course for Beginners\u0027\u003C/strong\u003E course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this course, \u003Cstrong\u003Eyou\u0027ll have a\u003C/strong\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003Edetailed, step-by-step explanation of C Programming \u003C/strong\u003Ewhere you\u0027ll learn about the best ways to solve problems. \u003Cstrong\u003EThis is the course I wish I had when I was learning myself for the first time. \u003C/strong\u003EThis course comes with a \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E30-day money-back guarantee.

The goal of OPF is to minimize the operating cost of the power system while meeting all of the system\u0027s constraints, such as the power balance, voltage limits, and thermal limits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOPF models can be classified into two main categories: deterministic and stochastic. Deterministic OPF models assume that the future demand and generation are known with certainty. Stochastic OPF models, on the other hand, take into account the uncertainty of future demand and generation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe most common objective function for OPF is to minimize the operating cost of the power system. However, other objective functions can also be used, such as minimizing the emissions from the power system or maximizing the reliability of the power system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOPF models are typically solved using numerical optimization techniques. These techniques can be divided into two main categories: deterministic and heuristic. Deterministic optimization techniques guarantee that the optimal solution will be found, but they can be computationally expensive. Heuristic optimization techniques are less computationally expensive, but they do not guarantee that the optimal solution will be found.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOPF models are an essential tool for the operation of power systems. They are used to ensure that the power system is operating in a safe and efficient manner.

It is also probably the best solution in the market as it is interoperable i.e. Pyspark can easily be managed along with other technologies and other components of the entire pipeline. The earlier big data and Hadoop techniques included batch time processing techniques.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPyspark is an open-source program where all the codebase is written in Python which is used to perform mainly all the data-intensive and machine learning operations. It has been widely used and has started to become popular in the industry and therefore Pyspark can be seen replacing other spark based components such as the ones working with Java or Scala. One unique feature which comes along with Pyspark is the use of datasets and not data frames as the latter is not provided by Pyspark. Practitioners need more tools that are often more reliable and faster when it comes to streaming real-time data. The earlier tools such as Map-reduce made use of the map and the reduce concepts which included using the mappers, then shuffling or sorting and then reducing them into a single entity. This MapReduce provided a way of parallel computation and calculation. The Pyspark makes use of in-memory techniques that don\u2019t make use of the space storage being put into the hard disk. It provides a general-purpose and a faster computation unit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe skills related to development, big data, and the Hadoop ecosystem and the knowledge of Hadoop and analytics concepts are the tangible skills that you can learn from these PySpark Tutorials.
