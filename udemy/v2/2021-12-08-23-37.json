If you know freelancers on the freelancing websites are doing these jobs on very small amounts like 10 dollars or 20 dollars but you can easily price this service on your website for 80 dollars and 100 dollars. Now let say you have priced this service for 80 dollars so you received 80 dollars from the customer and let say you pay 20 dollars to the freelancer for doing this job, so the remaining 60 dollars is your profit in this one order.

Unfortunately, the contemporary but dry conflict resolution and mediation techniques are insufficient to resolve complex and sensitive disagreements, especially when addressing delicate human interactions. After negotiating and mediating for over a decade, I realized that conflicts were manageable until people unknowingly complicated them even against their interests. In most cases, the underlying needs, fears, and wishes were undiscovered and miscommunicated to the other party. Therefore, I combined transactional analysis (TA), cognitive-behavioral psychology (CBT), and non-violent communication (NVC) techniques in my mediation and coaching efforts to comprehend the human mind and behavior accurately, its manifestation during disagreements, and facilitate mutually acceptable solutions even for the most complicated disputes. In this course, you will learn how to tactfully resolve disputes and communicate differences without damaging relationships in line with the latest research-based concepts from neuroscience, practical psychology, negotiation, mediation, and effective interpersonal communication strategies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EYou will:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Discover how the brain reacts during conflicts and disagreements (conflict perception, fear, stress, anxiety, fight-and-flight response, etc.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Understand the human behavior when influenced by defense mechanisms, attachment styles, and automatic thought patterns\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Learn specific actions for preventing and resolving conflicts at work and in life\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Apply practical strategies for negotiating and mediating disagreements\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Master interpersonal communication rules to promote collaboration, trust, and understanding\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Become tactfully assertive to communicate differences and needs successfully\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Think strategically about what you say when you talk\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Gain self-awareness and control about what you hear when you listen\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis course is practical and engaging, and you will be learning the methods and strategies through case studies, real-life scenarios, examples, and exercises.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWho this course is for:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Professionals and individuals who want to build success and happiness in their professional and personal life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Managers, team leaders, and directors who want to apply advanced concepts, mechanisms, and strategies to create healthy workplaces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Employers who want to improve the psychological safety in their teams.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Couples and partners who experience differences and difficulties yet want to work on their relationship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Anyone who wants to enhance their people and communication skills.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Anyone interested in learning the whys behind the whats in conflict resolution and interpersonal communication.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERemember, regardless of the root causes of disputes, the right strategies can resolve the differences.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"Ingl\u00E9s","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-interpersonal-communication-and-conflict-resolution/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4375660_afe8_5.jpg","duration":"2 horas","enrolledStudentsCount":"718 estudiantes","lastUpdated":"Fecha de la \u00FAltima actualizaci\u00F3n: 11/2021","targetAudiences":["Team leaders, senior-level managers, directors, and business owners who are curious about improving their conflict resolution and communication strategies","Couples, partners, and family members who experience difficulties in their relationships","Human resources, mediators, and negotiators who want to enhance their people skills and mediation tactics.","Professionals who struggle in their teams and want to find solutions to their problems."],"tags":["Negocios","Comunicaci\u00F3n","Gesti\u00F3n de conflictos"],"rating":{"count":2,"averageValue":"5.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"Saner Ahmedov","url":"/user/saner-ahmedov-2/","totalNumberOfStudents":807,"totalNumberOfReviews":2,"averageRating":5}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"THOUGHTPROVOKING","originalPrice":"1.920\u00A0\u20B9","discountedPrice":"1.248\u00A0\u20B9","expirationText":"5 saat","discountPercentage":35}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/microsoft-excel-learn-ms-excel-for-data-analysis/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":3011572,"title":"Microsoft Excel - Learn MS EXCEL For DATA Analysis","shortDescription":"Excel: learn how Excel can be used for data analysis by creating excel project-excel app-other excel tools","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EWhether you are interested in learning\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Different ways of how to properly use Microsoft Excel\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Learn the basics of Data Analysis\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Learn how to create different Excel Apps\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Just grow your Knowledge about this amazing Microsoft App\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr any other reason, this course is definitely for you.
