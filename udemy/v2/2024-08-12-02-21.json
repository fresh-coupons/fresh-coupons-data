And for small businesses, the most succesfull ones, they are already doing it in a modern way from the first day.  This transformation - it is a moving away from old way of communications, like phone calls, email, or even fax - to new way - whatsapp, facebook messenger, instagram direct messages, telegram - any messaging apps that people are using in their everyday life. And now they are starting to us\u0443 it to talk to businesses. To chat with an online store, with a bank, medical clinic - with any organization out there.","All of these companies need employees or contractors who understand how to make this shift, this transition.

Zero trust architectures simplify network infrastructure, make users happier, and keep cyberthreats at a distance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince John Kindervag, then at Forrester Research, coined the phrase, zero trust architectures follow the maxim \u0022never trust, always verify.\u0022 To block inappropriate access and lateral movement throughout an environment, zero trust architecture enforces access policies based on context\u2014including the user\u0027s role and location, the device they\u0027re using, and the data they\u0027re asking for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA zero trust architecture means you know who\u0027s using what, and you can track it, including encrypted traffic; you need to monitor and verify the traffic between parts of the environment; and you need multifactor authentication (MFA) that goes beyond passwords.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn important thing to remember is that in a zero trust architecture, a resource\u0027s location isn\u0027t as important as before. Rather than rigid network segmentation, software-defined microsegmentation protects your data, workflows, services, and such anywhere, in your data center or distributed hybrid or multicloud.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy using a network-centric data security strategy that provides specific access only to those who need it, Zero Trust Architecture focuses on the business needs and functionality of an organization. By enabling parameters to dictate access and restrictions, the Zero Trust model views data security from a whole new perspective. As opposed to legacy networks that have little to no visibility or control over network and data usage, Zero Trust Architectures see all network traffic through segmentation gateways with granular policies governing access to data, apps, and assets. There are certain rules that have to be followed before a resource can be accessed in a Zero Trust network.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe five major topics I want to cover in this master\u0027s course are\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

for entering financial data into QuickBooks for financial planning and year-end tax preparation. \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe bookkeeping system we discuss will also describe the relationship between the bookkeeper, the business, and the year-end tax and financial statement preparers. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe will outline a cash basis bookkeeping system using QuickBooks, a system that will enter most transactions directly into the check register. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe course will discuss the responsibilities of a bookkeeper and the responsibilities of the business when a bookkeeping engagement in entered into.\u0026nbsp; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe will work through a sample bookkeeping project in QuickBooks including the setting up of a new QuickBooks company file. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe course will practice entering data into the QuickBooks register directly from a bank statement. We will provide practice bank statements to use with the project as well as step by step instructional videos. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs we enter data directly into the check register from the bank statement, we will compare and contrast the cash basis system we are using to a full accounting cycle system. We will also review the financial statements periodically to see how QuickBooks is using the data to make reports. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter entering data into the QuickBooks check register from the bank statement, we will perform bank reconciliations. As we perform bank reconciliations, we will discuss what a bank reconciliation is and the benefits a bank reconciliation provides. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe course will then discuss options for entering specific accounting data into QuickBooks including payroll, equipment, loan payments, insurance, credit card payments, and invoices. We will provide practice QuickBooks files for different options related to the items listed above and explore the pros and cons of each option. The bookkeeping options will help tailor our system to our specific bookkeeping needs. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs we enter accounting data into the system we will discuss common questions we will have when entering the first few months of data and how to write down these questions, move forward with data input, and organize the financial data so that we can quickly go back to it once our client questions are answered. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis course will discuss, print, and export month end and year end reports, reports a bookkeeper may provide to clients monthly and reports the business will need at year-end for tax preparation. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe will discuss year-end adjusting entries. The bookkeeping system we propose will depend on an outside accounting firm, tax preparer, or CPA firm to help with the year-end adjusting entries. As bookkeepers we want to be aware of the adjusting entry process so we can work with any year-end accounting firm, tax preparer, or CPA firm. We will enter common adjusting entries into an adjusting entry Excel worksheet and into Quickbooks. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe course will then compare and contrast our different bookkeeping methods and show how those different bookkeeping decisions reconcile to the same numbers after the adjusting entry process. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, we will discuss whether or not to enter the year-end adjusting entries into our QuickBooks bookkeeping system and different options to do so. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to the instructional videos, this course will include downloadable\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u2022\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; QuickBooks Backup files\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u2022\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Excel practice files\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u2022\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Downloadable PDF Files\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe QuickBooks backup files are a great tool that allows us to jump ahead in the material or to rework material if we choose. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExcel practice files will be preformatted and will generally have at least two tabs, one tab with the completed work and a second tab with a preformatted worksheet we can fill in as we watch the instructional videos.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWho will we be learning from?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou will be learning from somebody who has technical experience in accounting concepts and in accounting software like QuickBooks, as well as experience teaching and putting together curriculum.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou will be learning from somebody who is a:\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u2022\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; CPA \u2013 Certified Public Accountant\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u2022\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; CGMA \u2013 Chartered Global Management Accountant\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u2022\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Master of Science in Taxation\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u2022\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; CPS \u2013 Certifies Post-Secondary Instructor\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u2022\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Curriculum Development Export\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a practicing CPA the instructor has worked with many technical accounting issues and helped work through them and discuss them with clients of all levels.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a CPA and professor, the instructor has taught many accounting classes and worked with many students in the fields of accounting, business, and business applications.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe instructor also has a lot of experience designing courses and learning how students learn best and how to help students achieve their objectives.

As we add adjusting and tax entries to the Excel worksheet, we will better understand how the worksheet is formatted and how best to use it. We will see how net income is calculated on a book basis, on a tax basis, and how the worksheet will show the reconciliation of the two. \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThis course is not designed to give tax advice but to show how to construct an Excel worksheet to track adjustments. \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe course will also discuss some alternative formats for building an adjusting entry and tax entry worksheet that can be found in practice.

It assumes that you\u0027re new to the language, so it gets you started with basic functionality such as creating functions, creating variables, and calling these lines of code from your standard HTML pages. It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E* Javascript Course Contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Introduction\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Array\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Variables\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Functions\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Objects\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Control Statements\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Cookies\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Loop statements\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Data Structures\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Error Handling\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Regular Expressions\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESee you inside the course\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThank you see you inside the course\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/css-and-javascript-complete-course-for-beginners/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4282170_1ea0.jpg","duration":"4 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"111,833.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["For People New to CSS And JavaScript","For People Who want to learn CSS And JavaScript Fundamentals and later Transition into Web Designing","For People New to Web Designing"],"tags":["CSS","JavaScript"],"rating":{"count":1544,"averageValue":"4.3"},"instructors":[{"name":"PROPER DOT INSTITUTE","url":"/user/vivek-dahibhate-2/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.302381}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"DB5E080F06B6136DFF67","originalPrice":"\u20B91,999","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/crm-at-sales-service-marketing-and-business-management/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4508686,"title":"Professional Diploma in CRM Platforms Management","shortDescription":"CRM Platforms at Sales, Service, Marketing and Business Management (Siebel, Dynamics CRM/365, Salesforce, SAP CRM)","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EProfessional Diploma in CRM Platforms Management (Sales, Service, Marketing and Business Management with CRM\u0026nbsp;Platforms)\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECourse provided by \u003Cstrong\u003EMTF Institute of Management, Technology and Finance\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMTF\u003C/strong\u003E is the global educational and research institute with HQ at Lisbon, Portugal, focused on business \u0026amp;
