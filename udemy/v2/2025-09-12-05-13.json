It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E*\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E javascript course contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript introduction\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript array\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript variables\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript functions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript objects\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript control statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript cookies\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript loop statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript data structures\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript error handling\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript regular expressions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESection 4- python programming language.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis course section provides an introduction to programming and the python language. students are introduced to core python programming concepts like conditionals, loops, variables, and functions. this section includes an overview of the various python aspects.

I\u2019m excited to have you with us as we dive into two of the most essential aspects of modern workplace dynamics.  In this course, we\u2019ll explore the Importance of Employee Relations in the Workplace\u2014a crucial element for fostering a cohesive and productive work environment. Strong employee relations not only promote trust and communication but also serve as the foundation for long-term organizational success.  We\u2019ll also discuss the Role of HR in Managing Employee Relations. Human Resources plays a pivotal role in maintaining positive relationships between employees and management. We\u0027ll examine best practices, policies, and frameworks that HR professionals use to create a healthy, collaborative workplace.  Next, we\u2019ll cover Employee Engagement\u2014a key factor that directly influences organizational performance. We\u2019ll explore how increased engagement leads to better productivity, innovation, and overall business outcomes.  To further support your understanding, we\u2019ll look at Tools and Techniques for Measuring Employee Engagement. Knowing how to assess engagement levels is essential for identifying both strengths and areas for improvement. Moreover, we\u2019ll examine Strategies for Enhancing Employee Engagement, offering practical insights and approaches to inspire commitment, enthusiasm, and motivation within your workforce.  Finally, we\u2019ll focus on Building a Positive Work Environment, which is vital for nurturing employee satisfaction, reducing turnover, and fostering long-term loyalty.  By the end of this course, you\u2019ll be equipped with the knowledge and tools to strengthen employee relations, boost engagement, and drive your organization\u2019s success. Let\u2019s begin and transform the way you approach employee engagement and relations!","Discussing employee relations and employee engagement together in one online course makes sense because both concepts are deeply interconnected and play a crucial role in creating a positive work environment and driving organizational success. Here\u0027s why it\u2019s beneficial to cover both topics in a single course:","1. Interconnectedness of Concepts:  Employee Relations focuses on the relationship between employers and employees, encompassing everything from conflict resolution and communication to fair treatment and legal compliance. Strong employee relations are the foundation for a positive work environment where employees feel respected and valued.  Employee Engagement is about how emotionally invested and motivated employees are in their work and the organization. High levels of engagement are often the result of effective employee relations. When employees feel that their concerns are addressed, their contributions are recognized, and they are treated fairly, they are more likely to be engaged.","2. Holistic Approach to HR Management:  Combining employee relations and engagement in one course allows for a more comprehensive understanding of how to manage and motivate employees. It enables HR professionals to see the bigger picture of how managing relationships directly impacts engagement levels, and how engaged employees contribute to better employee relations.","3. Strategies for Improvement:  Discussing both topics together allows for the exploration of strategies that improve both employee relations and engagement simultaneously. For example, open communication channels and conflict resolution mechanisms can enhance both relations and engagement. Recognizing and rewarding employees also strengthens both areas.","4. Efficiency in Learning:  Since both employee relations and engagement involve overlapping areas of HR practice, addressing them in a single course makes learning more efficient. HR professionals can gain insights into how improving one area can positively impact the other, leading to a more integrated approach to workforce management.","5. Practical Application:  A combined course can provide practical tools and frameworks that address both employee relations and engagement. For example, a module on conflict resolution might not only teach how to resolve disputes but also how to turn those resolutions into opportunities for increasing employee engagement.","6. Organizational Culture and Performance:  The course can help participants understand how both employee relations and engagement contribute to building a positive organizational culture. A strong culture, in turn, enhances performance, reduces turnover, and makes the organization a more attractive place to work.  In summary, discussing employee relations and employee engagement together in one online course provides a more complete understanding of how to create a positive, productive, and motivated workforce. By learning about both areas in tandem, HR professionals can develop strategies that support a healthy work environment and drive organizational success."],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":170,"averageValue":"4.5"},"instructors":[{"name":"MTF Institute of Management, Technology and Finance","url":"/user/mtfinstitute/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.48}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"30AFE9E9986E615EB65C","originalPrice":"\u20B91,339","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/introduction-to-financial-products-services-i/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5878864,"title":"Introduction to Financial Products \u0026 Services","shortDescription":"Learn about various Financial Services segments, products, services, definition, examples, risks and benefits","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIntroduction to Financial Products and Services\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn today\u2019s complex financial landscape, having a sound understanding of financial products and services is essential not only for professionals, aspiring financial professionals, managers, business owners, policy makers, regulators, auditors, accountants, but for anyone who wants to gain an understanding of our current world. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWho is this for?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhether you are an aspiring financial professional, a business owner, or an individual looking to better manage your financial future, this course offers you the foundational knowledge you need to navigate the financial world with confidence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis course is covers diverse segments of the financial services sector, various products, services, associated risks with the products and attendant benefits. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOur approach\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe simplify and demystify the often intimidating world of finance by breaking down key concepts and providing examples for a wide array of financial products and services in a clear, concise manner.
