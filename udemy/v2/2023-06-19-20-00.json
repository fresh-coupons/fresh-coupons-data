He\u0027s not simply some guy who\u0027s always liked to draw, got a microphone for Christmas and thought it\u0027d be cool to make a course. I regard myself as an exceptionally unexceptional draftsman but can already sense some improvement in the way I\u0027m tackling portraits.The value I\u0027ve already received leaves me with absolutely no complaints. You\u0027ll be getting A LOT of information from a guy who knows what he\u0027s doing with this course. And the demos - from blank sheet of paper to finished, fully rendered drawing - are both highly informative and inspirational. I\u0027m not sure you can ask for more than that from any instructor. It\u0027s a keeper. Many Thanks, Mr P for putting this together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u2013Sam Pollard\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf all the elements of drawing, portraiture is one of the most difficult to master. Practice alone is not enough to create portraits that come alive. That is the core value of this course. It provides a strong foundation for the individual to begin to master the creation of portraits of substance. This is not a course for the lazy. It requires patience and practice. But it will provide a roadmap that will allow the student to create fulfilling and satisfying portraits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u2013Stuart Givot\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn Excellent Course.

He provided some incredible insights into helping me improve my facial drawing skills. It\u0027s amazing of how easy and simple he teaches technique. I feel inspired and highly recommend his courses. I can\u0027t wait to learn more from him!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u2013Tuese Ahkiong\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is a clear, deep and well made course. Chris\u0027s sense of art teaching is excellent, it\u0027s like hanging out in his studio, looking over his shoulder (literally sometimes) and learning from following a professional. He talks out loud what goes on in his thoughts as he mindfully works his image. Seeing him work really helps me. His own career is used as an example, and I love all the personal stories that talk about his journey in the art world and specifically in this field of drawing portraits. The course is full of gold nuggets of info, stories, metaphors that help me put words and structure in my work. (I love the \u0022Valley of the Suck\u0022\u003Cstrong\u003E \u003C/strong\u003Econcept\u2013so true! ) This course really helped me to clarify my work in regards to values. Also, it helps to come back to those foundations of the underlying structure of the face. I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to build a strong foundation and seriously wants to get into portrait art. As it is in my case, I would recommend it as well to any professional that wants to come back and touch those foundations again, one tends to forget stuff!

There\u0027s the arcing current variation corrective factor that goes into a lot of detail, there is arc flash test, the continuous voltage spectrum, the enclosure size and correction factor, the table of equipment and class types, the minimum arcing current adjustments, and the 125 kVA transformer cutoff whatever happened to that, so we\u0027ll talk about that as well.

This is a full comprehensive course on prompt engineering for ChatGPT and AI text to image generator. As we all know, ChatGPT and generative AI have been growing very rapidly in the past couple months and prompt engineering definitely plays a very crucial role in maximising the quality of output generated by Chat GPT. Prompt engineering empowers users to shape the behaviour of Chat GPT, providing control, context, and customisation to the generated conversations. Those things are exactly what we are going to learn in this course. In the introduction session, you will learn the basic fundamentals of prompt engineering, understanding how it works, and technologies behind prompt engineering. Then, continuing by learning how to balance prompt specificity and generality since a prompt that is too specific will put limitations on ChatGPT creativity, however a prompt that is too general or broad will potentially cause ambiguity. Afterward, you will also get to know capabilities and limitations of ChatGPT, so you can set your expectations clearly and understand the output you can expect from ChatGPT. Then followed by learning the basic structure of ChatGPT prompt where you will extensively learn the formula of designing efficient prompt and continued by testing several ChatGPT prompt generator to automate and speed up more complex prompt creation using tools like FlowGPT, Fusion AI, and Hall Analysis where you automatically transform basic prompt to more complex prompt. Since relying on automation completely is not a wise decision to do, you are also going to learn techniques for framing questions and setting context in prompt manually and eventually compare their qualities with prompts generated by prompt generator. After making sure you understand all the basic concepts, we will enter the main part of the course where we will learn to write and design ChatGPT prompts for variety of topics or purposes, such as business, entrepreneurship, copywriting, marketing, programming, content creation, resume, cv, market research, learning languages, and email template. Once we are done with writing prompts for ChatGPT, we will move to prompt engineering for AI text to image generator where we will learn how to create and design effective prompts for Dall E and Leonardo AI text to image generator. Afterward, you are also going to be introduced to the latest AI technology that can help you a lot in producing high quality prompts and that is autonomous AI agent where you will learn how to utilise Agent GPT as your AI assistant to produce high quality prompts autonomously. Lastly, at the end of the course, you will also learn how you can potentially monetise your expertise in prompt engineering by selling your ChatGPT and AI text to image generator prompts on marketplaces like Etsy and Gumroad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, before getting into the course, we need to ask this question: Why learning prompt engineering is actually very important. Well, there are many different answers to that question but with the rise of ChatGPT and other generative AI technologies nowadays, it is undeniable that prompt engineering is a high demand skill set in the market as almost all industries use ChatGPT to automate their business.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow are things that you will learn in this course:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasic fundamentals of prompt engineering \u0026amp; understanding how it works\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECapabilities \u0026amp; limitations of ChatGPT\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearning how to create effective \u0026amp; high quality prompts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EZero-shot prompting, few-shot prompting, and chain of thoughts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWriting ChatGPT prompts for business, copywriting, programming, content creations, Resume, CV templates, market research, learning languages, and email templates\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWriting prompts for AI text to image generator such as Dall E and Leonardo AI\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUtilising Agent GPT as AI assistant to produce high quality prompts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESelling ChatGPT prompts on online marketplaces like Etsy and Gumroad\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-guide-to-chatgpt-prompt-engineering/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5385688_8d1d.jpg","duration":"4.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"1,213.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["People who are interested to learn how to design efficient prompts for ChatGPT","People who are interested to learn how to design efficient prompts for AI text to image generator"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":0,"averageValue":"0.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"Christ Raharja","url":"/user/christ-raharja/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":0}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"18BB324781AFF9656C5F","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/blackbook-for-sales-the-secrets-and-tricks-of-the-trade/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5327738,"title":"Black book for sales - the secrets and tricks of the trade","shortDescription":"All secrets you ever wanted to know about the sales trade","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to \u0022Black book for Sales - Secrets and Tricks of the Trade\u0022 on Udemy!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre you ready to unlock the hidden secrets of sales success?
