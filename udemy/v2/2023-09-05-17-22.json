What used to be distinct areas of the department have been rolled up under one umbrella. The talent management team is responsible for recruiting, hiring, developing, and retaining employees.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERecruiters are the heavy lifters in building any company\u2019s workforce. They\u2019re responsible for the total hiring process including posting positions on job boards, sourcing candidates through job fairs and social media, serving as the first-line contacts for running background checks to screen candidates, conducting the initial interviews, and coordinating with the hiring manager responsible for making the final selection. A recruiter\u2019s success is determined by several key metrics: the number of positions they fill each year, where candidates are coming from (e.g., job postings, social media, career fairs, etc.), the time it takes to fill positions, and reasons why an applicant wasn\u2019t hired. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEmployee relations or support is the area of the talent management team that is concerned with strengthening the employer-employee relationship. Human resources managers in this role study job satisfaction, employee engagement, organizational culture, and resolving workplace conflict. Gallup estimates that disengaged employees cost U.S. businesses a whopping $600\u002B billion each year in lost productivity, so this role is integral to the success of your business.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the company has a unionized workforce, this team will also work on labor relations, including negotiating collective bargaining agreements, creating managerial responses to union organizing campaigns, and interpreting labor union contract questions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe talent management group is also home to HR practitioners who focus on workforce planning and management. This area includes succession planning and retention efforts across the business, from the C-suite on down. When an employee resigns, retires, is fired or laid off, gets sick, or dies, the workforce planning team kicks into action.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.\tCompensation and Benefits\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn smaller companies the compensation and benefits roles can often be overseen by one or two human resources professionals, but companies with a larger workforce will typically split up the duties. HR functions in compensation include evaluating the pay practices of competitors and establishing the compensation structure. The compensation department is also responsible for creating job descriptions in tandem with department managers, as well as working with talent management on succession planning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the benefits side, HR practitioners are typically responsible for functions such as negotiating group health coverage rates with insurance carriers or coordinating with the company\u2019s 401(k) administrator. Of course, payroll is also part of the compensation and benefits area of HR, but many companies choose to outsource this function to a bookkeeper or payroll service provider. Those that don\u2019t generally put payroll practitioners in a separate team that works on the tactical process of generating payroll, with the compensation team focusing mainly on planning and strategy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.\tTraining and Development\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEvery company wants to see its employees thrive, which means providing them with all the tools they need to succeed. These tools aren\u2019t necessarily physical such as laptops, job-related software, or tools for a particular trade; they can include new employee orientation, leadership training programs, personal and professional development, and managerial training. Training and development (sometimes called learning and development) is an integral part of the HR team. Depending on the type of employee role played at the company, the training team might be responsible for building out instructional programs that have a direct effect on the success of the business. Today, many colleges and universities offer degrees in training and development; an instructional design degree would also be helpful in this role.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.\tHR Compliance\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELegal and regulatory compliance is a critical component of any HR department.

When a business is out of compliance, it can result in applicants or employees filing claims based on discriminatory hiring and employment practices or hazardous working conditions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe HR compliance team is also heavily involved\u2014working in tandem with other HR practitioners\u2014in developing all company policy that makes up the employee handbook. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5.\tWorkplace Safety\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA large focus area for HR is developing and supporting safety training and maintaining federally mandated logs in the event injuries or fatalities happen at work.

The process of writing the software itself involves the planning required for developing the product. The key principle of the RAD process is a reduction in planning to focus on a highly iterative design and construction process, enabling teams to accomplish more in less time, without impacting client satisfaction. Apart from a shorter time-to-market, one of the most significant advantages of RAD is client involvement. RAD emphasizes incremental and iterative delivery of functioning models to the client instead of following a rigid process model like the traditional SDLC. Depends on strong team and individual performances for identifying business requirements. Only system that can be modularized can be built using RAD. Requires highly skilled developers/designers. High dependency on modeling skills. Only suitable for scalable, component-based systems \u2013 RAD is best used for large systems with multiple components.

To run a business at optimal capacity, you need to reduce or eliminate waste from processes and improve production flow. In this course, you\u0027ll learn about Lean strategies to reduce waste by determining which operations add value and which don\u0027t. You\u0027ll explore the concept of continuous flow, and discover how to balance work processes to make production flow more efficient.

And in any business, one of the heaviest drains on profitability is waste. Lean waste can come in the form of time, material, and labor. But it may also be related to the utilization of skill-sets as well as poor planning. In lean manufacturing, waste is any expense or effort that is expended but which does not transform raw materials into an item the customer is willing to pay for. By optimizing process steps and eliminating waste, the only true value is added at each phase of production.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday, the Lean Manufacturing model recognizes 8 types of waste within an operation; seven originally conceived when the Toyota Production System was first conceived, and an eighth added when the lean methodology was adopted within the Western World.

You will also be taught how to identify, exploit and prevent each vulnerability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Command Execution Vulnerability:Command injection is an attack in which the goal is execution of arbitrary commands on the host operating system via a vulnerable application. Command injection attacks are possible when an application passes unsafe user supplied data (forms, cookies, HTTP headers etc.) to a system shell. In this attack, the attacker-supplied operating system commands are usually executed with the privileges of the vulnerable application. Command injection attacks are possible largely due to insufficient input validation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-File Inclusion Vulnerability:allows an attacker to include a file, usually exploiting a \u201Cdynamic file inclusion\u201D mechanisms implemented in the target application. The vulnerability occurs due to the use of user-supplied input without proper validation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-File Upload Vulnerability:Uploaded files represent a significant risk to applications. The first step in many attacks is to get some code to the system to be attacked. Then the attack only needs to find a way to get the code executed. Using a file upload helps the attacker accomplish the first step.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe consequences of unrestricted file upload can vary, including complete system takeover, an overloaded file system or database, forwarding attacks to back-end systems, client-side attacks, or simple defacement. It depends on what the application does with the uploaded file and especially where it is stored.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are really two classes of problems here. The first is with the file metadata, like the path and file name. These are generally provided by the transport, such as HTTP multi-part encoding. This data may trick the application into overwriting a critical file or storing the file in a bad location. You must validate the metadata extremely carefully before using it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other class of problem is with the file size or content. The range of problems here depends entirely on what the file is used for. See the examples below for some ideas about how files might be misused. To protect against this type of attack, you should analyse everything your application does with files and think carefully about what processing and interpreters are involved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESQL Injection Vulnerability:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESQL injection attacks allow attackers to spoof identity, tamper with existing data, cause repudiation issues such as voiding transactions or changing balances, allow the complete disclosure of all data on the system, destroy the data or make it otherwise unavailable, and become administrators of the database server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESQL Injection is very common with PHP and ASP applications due to the prevalence of older functional interfaces. Due to the nature of programmatic interfaces available, J2EE and ASP.NET applications are less likely to have easily exploited SQL injections.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe severity of SQL Injection attacks is limited by the attacker\u2019s skill and imagination, and to a lesser extent, defense in depth countermeasures, such as low privilege connections to the database server and so on.

Common methods include dictionary attacks, where a list of common words is used as the basis for guessing, and brute force attacks, where every possible combination of characters is tried.

Do children today use their imaginations as much as we did when we were kids? Do you see your children spinning incredible tales and stories in their fantasy play as we used to when we played \u201Ccops and robbers\u201D or \u201Chouse\u201D? Or does your child\u2019s fantasy play seem to consist only of repetitive movements which have no story to them? I am sure you are aware of such a situation\u2026 Nowadays children are no longer as creative as they once were.\u0026nbsp; We live in an era obsessed with numbers, data, and test scores, especially as they apply to our kids and their education.\u0026nbsp; Seeing the decline in creativity should make us concerned about our children\u2019s capacities to innovate, problem-solve, and navigate new and unfamiliar situations. \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the world of child development, you may hear the phrases like \u201Ccritical thinking skills\u201D and \u201Ccreative problem-solving abilities\u201D when referring to goals for your child\u2019s cognitive development. What we are really talking about is\u2026 imagination. The way to create human beings with imagination is to provide them with opportunities to develop it for themselves when they are very young. These opportunities are found in one place and one place only\u2026 that is, play. Played with paints, playing with play dough, costumes, glue, and crayons. Making a mess. Exploring the woods. Splashing in a puddle. Wondering at a caterpillar you notice inching by you. Pretending to be a bird, gliding through the sky. All of these involve a great deal of imagination and development of their creative skills to many folds.\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, as parents, we must first learn the process of creative learning which we can offer to our kids.

Solaris supports SPARC and x86-64 workstations and servers from Oracle and other vendors. Solaris was registered as compliant with UNIX 03 until 29 April 2019.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHistorically, Solaris was developed as proprietary software. In June 2005, Sun Microsystems released most of the codebase under the CDDL license, and founded the OpenSolaris open-source project. With OpenSolaris, Sun wanted to build a developer and user community around the software. After the acquisition of Sun Microsystems in January 2010, Oracle decided to discontinue the OpenSolaris distribution and the development model. In August 2010, Oracle discontinued providing public updates to the source code of the Solaris kernel, effectively turning Solaris 11 back into a closed source proprietary operating system. Following that, OpenSolaris was forked as illumos and is alive through several illumos distributions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn 2011, the Solaris 11 kernel source code leaked to BitTorrent. Through the Oracle Technology Network (OTN), industry partners can gain access to the in-development Solaris source code.[11] Solaris is developed under a proprietary development model, and only the source for open-source components of Solaris 11 is available for download from Oracle\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-unix-from-zero-to-hero-for-beginner/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/3552815_a273_5.jpg","duration":"9 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"376.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Anyone interested to learn Unix Oracle Solaris"],"tags":["Unix"],"rating":{"count":64,"averageValue":"4.4"},"instructors":[{"name":"Tareq Tech","url":"/user/tareq-mohammed-ali/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.6}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"ECCDF3E14F99EFAF7651","originalPrice":"\u20B92,799","discountedPrice":"\u20B9549","expirationText":"2 days","discountPercentage":80}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/linux-cluster-high-availability/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4403579,"title":"Linux Cluster High Availability with 2 real life Projects","shortDescription":"Linux HA Pacemaker (\u00A0Active - Active ) and (\u00A0Active - Passive ) in Real life example Setup on VMware ESXi hypervisor","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EThis course in \u003Cstrong\u003E2023\u003C/strong\u003E will teach you how to setup a \u003Cstrong\u003Ecluster \u003C/strong\u003Estep by step \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWill learn how to setup \u003Cstrong\u003EHigh Availability (\u0026nbsp;HA\u0026nbsp;using Pacemaker \u003C/strong\u003E)\u0026nbsp; (\u0026nbsp;\u003Cstrong\u003EActive - Active\u003C/strong\u003E )\u0026nbsp; and (\u0026nbsp;\u003Cstrong\u003EActive - Passive\u003C/strong\u003E ) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETeach you how the cluster works and components like :\u0026nbsp;\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E- Quorum\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E- Constraint \u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E- Resources \u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E- Fencing (\u0026nbsp;Stonith ) \u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E- Troubleshooting \u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E- Active - Active \u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E- Active - Passive \u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHistory\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThe project originated from a mailing list started in November 1997. Eventually Harald Milz wrote an odd sort of Linux-HA HOWTO. Unlike most HOWTOs, this was not about how to configure or use existing software, it was a collection of HA techniques which one could use if one were to write HA software for Linux.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EAlan Robertson was inspired by this description and thought that he could perhaps write some of the software for the project to act as a sort of initial seed crystal to help jump start the project. He got this initial software running on 18 March 1998. He created the first web site for the project on 19 October 1998, and the first version of the software was released on 15 November 1998.The first production customer of the software was Rudy Pawul of ISO-NE. The ISO-NE web site went into production in the second half of 1999.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EAt this point, the project was limited to two nodes and very simple takeover semantics, and no resource monitoring.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThis was cured with version 2 of the software, which added n-node clusters, resource monitoring, dependencies, and policies. Version 2.0.0 came out on 29 July 2005.[5] This release represented another important milestone as it was the first version where very large contributions (in terms of code size) were made by the Linux-HA community at large. This series of releases brought the project to a level of feature parity-or-superiority with respect to commercial HA software.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EAfter version 2.1.4, the cluster resource manager component (responsible for starting and stopping resources and monitoring resource and node failure) was split off into a separate project called Pacemaker,[6] and the resource agents and other \u0022glue\u0022 infrastructure were moved to separate packages.

It is used to improve the availability of software services such as databases, file sharing on a network, electronic commerce websites, or other applications.
