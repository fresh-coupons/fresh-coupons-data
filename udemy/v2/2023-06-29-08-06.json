You will Learn from the best Business and Make Profit !","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EThere\u2019s a HUGE difference between simply operating a used car dealership business and operating a profitable used car dealership. To get a better idea of the possible demand for used cars in your area, you\u2019ll need to crunch some numbers. By knowing the number of used cars sold in your area every year and month , you can estimate what percentage of the market you will be likely to be able to corner and reach. By locating the average profit per vehicle, you can get an approximate idea of how much profit and money your dealership able to make per year. While the groundwork associated with opening a dealership can be time-consuming, expensive, and demanding, the real test of your dealership\u2019s viability doesn\u2019t begin until after you open your doors to the public. Without the right management of your dealership, all the effort you put into laying the foundation will be wasted. While each state has its own rules and regulations, there are several important universal aspects of operating a car dealership and tips on how you can get the most out of your investment. Your customers are the single most important factor in the success or failure of your business, so taking the time to identify who they are and what they care about is absolutely vital. Take a look at the types of cars you plan on selling, then do some research to determine the age, gender, and income level of the average individual who owns those types of vehicles. Later down the line, this will allow you to tailor your marketing and advertising efforts toward those who are most likely to be interested in what you have to offer. Make sure to base any of your conclusions regarding your target clients on real actionable data; don\u2019t simply make assumptions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/car-flipping-earn-money-from-selling-used-cars-ocsaly/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4741312_7b69_3.jpg","duration":"1.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"22,942.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Beginner Used Car Business Leaders"],"tags":["Car Flipping"],"rating":{"count":74,"averageValue":"4.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"OCSALY Academy | 210.000\u002B Students","url":"/user/online-academy-of-computer-science/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.03125}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"BEST_COURSE","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"2 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/etabs-v19-safe-v16-in-villa-structural-design-in-uaecad/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4333026,"title":"ETABS v19 \u0026 SAFE v16 in Villa Structural Design in UAE\u002BCAD","shortDescription":"Modeling, analysis and design of 4 stories Villa in UAE using CSI ETABS and SAFE software","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EThis course not just a tutorial on software ETABS and SAFE but it is a complete understanding about structural design analysis, how civil engineer must begin with the project, how he/she must think, how we can determine the dimension of the element before modeling them check it in the software.

We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables.

Academic integrity entails honesty, ethics, transparency, accountability, trust in academic and research endeavours. All the research scholars and faculty members must be honest and sincere while executing academic and research activities. While following and understanding the existing research, the originality of the work conducted by the researcher has to be established in order to justify one\u2019s own creative content in the research reports that could be in the form of an article, dissertation or thesis. It is imperative to use some of the previously published content while writing an article with proper citations and references. It is, therefore, important to understand and learn how to ethically write an article to avoid the plagiarism issues while writing research publications. Even students at the graduate level and post graduate level should be made available with the ethical issues, conduct of research, Academic Integrity, Academic/Research Misconduct, use of proper citation styles, use of reference management tools, abstaining from fabrication, falsification, manipulation or tempering of data, avoid unethical practices, understanding plagiarism, How to Avoid Plagiarism, Reference Management Tools, Writing and Checking Tools, How to Cite Sources Properly, Types of Plagiarism, How to Detect Plagiarism, Popular Plagiarism Detection Software, Use of Plagiarism Detection Software, Features and Functionalities of popular antiplagiarism software, Policy Guidelines for Handling Plagiarism in Institutions, Provide Training and Tools for Reference Management and academic Writing Skills, etc.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/ethics-of-research/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4444522_9ec8.jpg","duration":"1 total hour","enrolledStudentsCount":"13,451.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Bachelor Degree","Masters Degree","PhD Scholars","Researchers","Facuilty"],"tags":["Professional Ethics"],"rating":{"count":113,"averageValue":"3.8"},"instructors":[{"name":"Dr. Swati Chakraborty","url":"/user/swati-chakraborty-5/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.0740743}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"ETHIC_FREE_623","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"3 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-wifi-hacking-course-beginner-to-advanced/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5278376,"title":"Complete WiFi Hacking Course: Beginner to Advanced","shortDescription":"\u0633\u062A\u062A\u0639\u0644\u0645 \u0643\u064A\u0641\u064A\u0647 \u0627\u062E\u062A\u0628\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u062E\u062A\u0631\u0627\u0642 \u0634\u0628\u0643\u0627\u062A \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0627\u064A\u0641\u0627\u064A \u0645\u0647\u0645\u0627 \u0643\u0627\u0646\u062A \u062F\u0631\u062C\u0647 \u062D\u0645\u0627\u064A\u062A\u0647\u0627","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EThis course is all about Wi-Fi and the security of wireless networks.

Many systems and network administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what hosts are available on the network, what services (application name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems (and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It was designed to rapidly scan large networks but works fine against single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap suite includes an advanced GUI and results in the viewer (Zenmap), a flexible data transfer, redirection, and debugging tool (Ncat), a utility for comparing scan results (Ndiff), and a packet generation and response analysis tool (Nping).
