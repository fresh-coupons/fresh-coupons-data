And then we are going to build a full authentication system from scratch. While building this system I am going to introduce you to hashing and dehashing passwords. And then, we are going to build general and cool features inside our own app. It\u0027s going to be mainly on selecting and placing data. After this part, we are going to move to the next crucial part of our app and that\u0027s the booking part which is going to be challenging but I am going to guide you through it. it\u0027s mainly validations and inserting data. and then we are going to move to pay with PayPal which is also kind of problematic but I am going to help you. The next move is taking care of general things about our website like fixing bugs, grabbing bookings for every user, adding a 404 page, validating, and so on. We are going to move on to the second part of our app and which is the admin panel. And it\u0027s going to be huge. We will take care of a lot of things. We will manage bookings, admins, hotels, rooms and so much more. Of course, this is not all. There is a lot to talk about but this is just a simple description of our system.

Firstly, you move in the correct direction when being attacked. Secondly, and this is important, you can see what\u2019s happening behind you in your fight for survival.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe teach a very simple system of self-defense when attacked from behind. Of course, you can\u2019t fight or defend yourself if you can\u2019t see the punch in the first place. This means that self-defense starts with simple situational awareness. You must be aware of your surroundings, and more importantly, you must be aware of what is happening behind you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith that in mind, there are simple measures that you can take to avoid being caught unaware. For example, when walking in urban environments avoid walking close to doorways, entrances, or intersections with other pathways. These are potential choke spots where people can step out to follow or grab you. Another helpful self-defense tip requires that you use the reflections of glass, windows, and cars to see what is happening around or behind you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving said that, being ambushed from behind can be rare, especially when there are lots of people in the street around you. Therefore, we suggest that you don\u2019t become overly paranoid when doing your local shopping. Simply awareness will suffice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, in the event that something should happen this course will help give you the knowledge and the self-defense steps that could make a difference if you are suddenly attacked from behind. Realistically, you will get punched in the face if someone runs up and attacks you from behind without any warning. So in this course, we look at ways to move and defend yourself if your attacker comes from behind. This gives you some chance to fight back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other aspect of this course is we will study the body mechanics of the attacker as it relates to the Yin Yang Principle of Kyusho Jutsu.\u0026nbsp; This principle can be studied in depth and can be very powerful when you understand the concepts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are 15 Principles of Kyusho Jutsu and Yin Yang is but one.\u0026nbsp; It is a principle that can be combined with other principles or it can stand on its own.\u0026nbsp; In Module 7 of my Kyusho Jutsu Black Belt course, I go through the other principles, but in this course, I have combined the Yin Yang Principle with Rear Attacks.\u0026nbsp; With this relation, you will begin to understand the principle better and be able to have greater control over your attacker.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn our Whiteboard lecture, I will discuss more on the Yin Yang Principle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJoin me in this course, as I teach you the pressure points of the body and how to effectively use them with Rear Attacks to defend yourself from your attacker.\u0026nbsp;
