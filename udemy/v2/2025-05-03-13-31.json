A successful manager is now expected to act as a leader, a mentor, and a coach, guiding their team members towards individual and collective success. This paradigm shift highlights the significance of coaching techniques in the realm of managerial responsibilities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis article delves into the importance of utilizing coaching techniques in the workplace, particularly within the role of a manager or leader.

In the past, managers were primarily responsible for enforcing rules and ensuring productivity.
