It establishes the properties of polynomials, which behave analogously to integers in that they are closed under addition, subtraction, and multiplication.

The lecture gives examples on how to add or subtract polynomials (polynomials of the same degree can be added or subtracted depending on the requirement of the question). This is not true for multiplication and division. The horizontal and vertical formats are also applicable for multiplication of polynomials (the multiplication is performed between two functions one at a time). We make use of special product patterns to help in simplifying the task encountered in multiplication of polynomials.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDivision of polynomials by a divisor (both long division and synthetic division method) is extensively covered in this course because it forms the backbone under which the remainder theorem is explicitly defined. Also, the lectures deeply involved areas of rational root theorem and factor theorem for solving the possible zeros and factors of a given polynomial functions and equations. Pascal\u0027s triangle and Factor theorem are broadly treated with examples for easy understanding of expansion and remainder theorem. Also, special patterns are included in lecture one. The same privilege is given to the synthetic method of division with some examples which make our lectures unique so that attending this course is a guarantee to master polynomial functions and equations , course two.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProceeding lectures include how to find the solutions of the functions.
