Streamlined Onboarding: New developers can quickly get up to speed by accessing the project\u0027s Git repository and understanding its history.  Reduced Risk: Git\u0027s safety net and version control minimize the risk of code loss or corruption, protecting valuable intellectual property.","Git proficiency is indispensable for modern software developers and plays a vital role in driving successful software development at enterprise companies.
