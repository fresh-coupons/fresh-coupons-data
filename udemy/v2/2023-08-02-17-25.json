The World Wide Web Consortium\u0027s XML 1.0 Specification of 1998 and several other related specifications - all of them free open standards - define XML. The design goals of XML emphasize simplicity, generality, and usability across the Internet. It is a textual data format with strong support via Unicode for different human languages. Although the design of XML focuses on documents, the language is widely used for the representation of arbitrary data structures such as those used in web services. Several schema systems exist to aid in the definition of XML-based languages, while programmers have developed many application programming interfaces (APIs) to aid the processing of XML data.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u0022\u003Cstrong\u003EXSD\u003C/strong\u003E (\u003Cstrong\u003EXML Schema Definition\u003C/strong\u003E), a recommendation of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), specifies how to formally describe the elements in an Extensible Markup Language (XML) document. It can be used by programmers to verify each piece of item content in a document. They can check if it adheres to the description of the element it is placed in. Like all XML schema languages, XSD can be used to express a set of rules to which an XML document must conform in order to be considered \u0022valid\u0022 according to that schema. However, unlike most other schema languages, XSD was also designed with the intent that determination of a document\u0027s validity would produce a collection of information adhering to specific data types. Such a post-validation \u003Cem\u003Einfoset\u003C/em\u003E can be useful in the development of XML document processing software.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat you\u0027ll learn from this course:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E- You will learn all the theory about how to use XML language correctly, as well as all about its general and specific syntaxes, according to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) official recommendations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- You will learn all the practice about how to code your XML files, using the elements, attributes and types - default and custom ones - from the referred XSD schemas, as well as how to test the correctness and validation of your XML instances against their referred XSD docs using Eclipse IDE automation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- You will adventure into the complete theory background about how to create your own XSD schema documents and master the details about XSD general and specific syntaxes, according to W3C official specifications.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- You will practice, through tens of examples, how to code your own XSD files, using the 3 design methods suggested by W3C, as well as how to take advantage of all main base elements, attributes and types (default W3C library/namespace) to create your own personalized XML/XSD components.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- You will have pretty clear what default and custom namespaces are, as well as prefixes, both at the XML instances as at the XSD documents. You\u0027ll learn how to import and include multiple XSD documents into one same XSD and also how to refer to multiple XSD documents from one same XML instance, nice and easy... even using your own personal brand as the prefix for customizing your code (in my case: danielpm1982).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- All this course\u0027s theory, as well as the good practices and techniques used, are based on the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and W3Schools contents, here with much better and complete explanations and practical examples.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- After doing this course, you\u0027ll understand much easier all the document types used at Web Services development, or any other application that uses XML and XSD (or WSDL).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- All source codes are available at my GitHub, as well as attached to each practice lecture, as a zip file. You can easily download, study, reuse and test them yourself, for learning purposes, and even create much better examples. This is how you learn: starting from the basics and evolving, through practicing, until proficiency. All at your own pace and time and re-watching any lecture as many times as you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Additional content, as WSDL and JSON theory and practical lectures, as well as lectures with sample Web Services projects, demonstrating the real world applicability of XML, XSD, WSDL and JSON, will be added incrementally within the next months, at this same course. But you can finish this course with the current content, as it is, and receive your Udemy Certification on that\u2026 and if you want, you may return later, watch the future extra content lectures (WSDL and JSON) and, at the end, receive another Udemy Certification with the updated content and course name. All students will be notified when any future content is added.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- This course is already composed of more than 10 hours, a workload greater than almost all other same-topic courses at Udemy.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPrerequisites:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E- If you wanna practice, you should have Eclipse IDE installed on your PC or notebook. But you can just watch the theory and practical lectures, at any device with internet access, in case you have no computer available at that moment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- No programming languages or frameworks are required for this course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- No silly or useless tests will be imposed onto you. You will know you got the content right when you implement your own code and test it successfully, as done at our practical lectures.

All related links, with W3C content, are attached to each theory lecture description.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat\u0027s the difference between taking this course and simply viewing W3Schools material at their own site ?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/strong\u003EAlthough the content is almost entirely referenced on W3C publications, this course offers much better, organized and understandable explanations about the content, and also a much greater set of examples, using Eclipse IDE, from the easiest to the most complex ones. At W3Schools site, for instance, you only find very simple snippets of code.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat\u0027s the difference between taking this course and the other XML/XSD courses at Udemy ?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E- No objection at all to those who may take more than one course. But this one has an innovative methodology, is more organized and complete (over 10 hours of theory and practices already), as well as it has much better examples, explained step by step, without any hurried 2-3 min lectures. It covers IN FULL everything that W3C suggests about XML and XSD.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- This course is organized similar to university or college lectures, with an average of 1h per lecture. The organization is oriented towards the content itself and not short time limited lectures. I think prioritizing the content on the curriculum organization contributes way better to cohesiveness as well as to the organization and consolidation of the content in anyone\u0027s brain. 2-3 min classes end up being a big confusion resulted from a too high fragmentation level of the content. Students always criticize on other courses that everything\u0027s too hastily delivered, as if the students already knew the subjects. Here, and differently from that, you\u0027ll see it\u0027s all nicely and easily delivered, and you won\u0027t get lost on the content, even if you never heard about XML or any structural or programming language before. You\u0027re free, though, to plan your own individual learning schedule. Just take note of the subject you last saw, and then continue from there when you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Finally, this course is divided into Theory and Practice lectures. You\u0027ll, thus, have multiple chances, from multiple explanation perspectives, to learn or complement the acknowledging of each topic, subtopics, practices, and so on. And, of course, at your own time, pace and individual needs. The access to this course will be forever yours (it doesn\u0027t expire) and you\u0027ll be able to review any lecture as much as you want. A big advantage of e-learning recorded lectures compared to live face-to-face attendance lectures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWelcome to the course !!

The delivery of a service for a cost is also considered a sale.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a real art to selling, as any salesperson probably knows. You walk a fine line between alienating the customer and making them feel comfortable. Sales is not something you can pick up right away; it takes time and practice to perfect the art of closing a deal. Developing a solid and proven technique is a big part of learning how to sell efficiently. Here are five selling techniques every salesperson should master.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAccording to Active Listening, One of the reasons that prospective clients are so wary of salespeople is because they anticipate a pushy demeanor and pressure to purchase a client. Setting out with a clear agenda and not interacting with the client beyond a fixed aim is a mistake; it won\u2019t win you sales and it definitely won\u2019t win you fans. More effective selling techniques involve active listening\u2014 allowing for a dialogue with the customer that isn\u2019t just a one-sided conversation. Listening to their concerns, questions, and hesitations will help you respond to them better, and will help the prospective client trust you more as well. People who trust you are much more likely to make a purchase with you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAccording to Warm Calls, Relying on cold calls is an ineffective sales technique; they irritate potential clients and are often screened anyway. Shifting to a warm calling is a much better\u2014and more efficient\u2014way of handling selling. Warm calls involve calling prospective clients who have been chosen for their potential to be receptive to your sales pitch. This includes \u201Cwarming up\u201D leads through things like social media outreach and prior research of the client. Warm calling leads to much higher success rates, since it does away with the scatter shot approach to selling, which is often just a waste of your time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFeatures \u0026amp; Benefits: This one may seem obvious, but it\u2019s not always efficiently carried out by the salesperson. While it\u2019s important to go over the practical functions of a product or service, simply describing the service or product and its various functions isn\u2019t enough to convince someone to make a purchase. The prospective client doesn\u2019t just need to know how it works, they need to understand why they should care. Emphasizing the features and benefits of the product, and the ways it can prove valuable to the potential client, is a classic and effective selling technique that is continually reiterated because it works. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENeeds \u0026amp; Solutions : People like practical reasons why they should invest in a product or service, and they\u2019re more likely to listen to a sales pitch if it offers an effective solution. This sales technique works best with the technique of active listening; it\u2019s important to listen to the client to get a sense of how the product could benefit them, and then tailor your pitch to that individual or company. The sense that the sales pitch has been personalized will make feel the client more comfortable trusting and listening to the salesperson, because they feel like they\u2019re learning about a solution that will work for them, not just you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAccording to Social Selling, Huge pools of potential clients are easily accessible through online social networking, and when you discourage the use of social media as a selling technique, you limit the scope of your salespeople and are potentially standing in the way of future sales. Social media and online connectivity are huge parts of modern communication, and it\u2019s important to adapt to this way of doing business. Actively encourage salespeople to reach out to potential clients and foster leads through social media sites like LinkedIn and Twitter; you\u2019re sales numbers will thank you. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this master course you will learn 5 major topics,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

It varies from person to person, but let\u0027s just say you probably won\u0027t master these in your first few months.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdvanced SEO typically involves technical concepts that are somewhat advanced, and/or a deeper understanding of the workings of Google\u0027s algorithm and are often employed by Professional SEOs. Anyone can master advanced concepts with the right strategic guidance and real life application.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAccording to Griffin, Search engine optimization is the science of improving a website to increase its visibility when people search for products or services. The more visibility a website has on search engines, the more likely it is that brand captures business.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWebsite visibility is commonly measured by the placement -- or ranking -- of the site on search engine results pages (SERPs). And companies always vie for the first page, where they are most likely to garner the most attention.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing Google as an example, SERPs often feature ads at the top of the page. These are positions that businesses are willing to pay for to ensure placement on that first page. Following ads are the regular search listings, which marketers and search engines refer to as organic search results. The SEO process aims to increase a business\u0027s organic search results, driving organic search traffic to the site. This enables data marketers to distinguish between traffic that comes to a website from other channels -- such as paid search, social media, referrals and direct -- and the organic search traffic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrganic search traffic is usually higher-quality traffic because users are actively searching for a specific topic, product or service for which a site might rank. If a user finds that site through the search engine, it can lead to better brand engagement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow does SEO work? While there is a way to maximize results, it is almost impossible to fully manipulate search algorithms. Businesses often look to the shortest path toward ideal results with the least amount of effort, but SEO requires a lot of action and time. There is no SEO strategy where something can be changed today with the expectation of clear results tomorrow. SEO is a long-term project, with daily action and constant activity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch engines use bots to crawl all website pages, downloading and storing that information into a collection known as an index. This index is like a library and when someone searches for something in it, the search engine acts as the librarian. The search engine pulls and displays relevant information from the search query and shows users content related to what they were looking for. Search engine algorithms analyze webpages in the index to determine the order those pages should be displayed on the SERP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe learning objectives of SEO (Search Engine Optimization) encompass various skills and knowledge that enable individuals to effectively optimize websites and content for search engines.

What used to be distinct areas of the department have been rolled up under one umbrella. The talent management team is responsible for recruiting, hiring, developing, and retaining employees.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERecruiters are the heavy lifters in building any company\u2019s workforce. They\u2019re responsible for the total hiring process including posting positions on job boards, sourcing candidates through job fairs and social media, serving as the first-line contacts for running background checks to screen candidates, conducting the initial interviews, and coordinating with the hiring manager responsible for making the final selection. A recruiter\u2019s success is determined by several key metrics: the number of positions they fill each year, where candidates are coming from (e.g., job postings, social media, career fairs, etc.), the time it takes to fill positions, and reasons why an applicant wasn\u2019t hired. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEmployee relations or support is the area of the talent management team that is concerned with strengthening the employer-employee relationship. Human resources managers in this role study job satisfaction, employee engagement, organizational culture, and resolving workplace conflict. Gallup estimates that disengaged employees cost U.S. businesses a whopping $600\u002B billion each year in lost productivity, so this role is integral to the success of your business.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the company has a unionized workforce, this team will also work on labor relations, including negotiating collective bargaining agreements, creating managerial responses to union organizing campaigns, and interpreting labor union contract questions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe talent management group is also home to HR practitioners who focus on workforce planning and management. This area includes succession planning and retention efforts across the business, from the C-suite on down. When an employee resigns, retires, is fired or laid off, gets sick, or dies, the workforce planning team kicks into action.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.\tCompensation and Benefits\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn smaller companies the compensation and benefits roles can often be overseen by one or two human resources professionals, but companies with a larger workforce will typically split up the duties. HR functions in compensation include evaluating the pay practices of competitors and establishing the compensation structure. The compensation department is also responsible for creating job descriptions in tandem with department managers, as well as working with talent management on succession planning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the benefits side, HR practitioners are typically responsible for functions such as negotiating group health coverage rates with insurance carriers or coordinating with the company\u2019s 401(k) administrator. Of course, payroll is also part of the compensation and benefits area of HR, but many companies choose to outsource this function to a bookkeeper or payroll service provider. Those that don\u2019t generally put payroll practitioners in a separate team that works on the tactical process of generating payroll, with the compensation team focusing mainly on planning and strategy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.\tTraining and Development\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEvery company wants to see its employees thrive, which means providing them with all the tools they need to succeed. These tools aren\u2019t necessarily physical such as laptops, job-related software, or tools for a particular trade; they can include new employee orientation, leadership training programs, personal and professional development, and managerial training. Training and development (sometimes called learning and development) is an integral part of the HR team. Depending on the type of employee role played at the company, the training team might be responsible for building out instructional programs that have a direct effect on the success of the business. Today, many colleges and universities offer degrees in training and development; an instructional design degree would also be helpful in this role.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.\tHR Compliance\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELegal and regulatory compliance is a critical component of any HR department. Employment and labor laws are highly complex, and having a team devoted to monitoring this ever-changing landscape is essential to keeping companies out of trouble with federal, state, and local governments\u2019 laws. When a business is out of compliance, it can result in applicants or employees filing claims based on discriminatory hiring and employment practices or hazardous working conditions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe HR compliance team is also heavily involved\u2014working in tandem with other HR practitioners\u2014in developing all company policy that makes up the employee handbook. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5.\tWorkplace Safety\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA large focus area for HR is developing and supporting safety training and maintaining federally mandated logs in the event injuries or fatalities happen at work.

When a human being ascends the steps of the pyramid, self-actualization is reached. Beyond the routine of needs fulfillment, Maslow envisioned moments of extraordinary experience, known as peak experiences, profound moments of love, understanding, happiness, or rapture, during which a person feels more whole, alive, self-sufficient, and yet a part of the world. This is similar to the flow concept of Mih\u00E1ly Cs\u00EDkszentmih\u00E1lyi. The concept of flow is the idea that after our basic needs are met we can achieve greater happiness by altering our consciousness by becoming so engaged in a task that we lose our sense of time.

It\u0027s built to be safer and more productive than Java, reducing common programming errors and cutting down the code lines, thereby improving readability and maintainability. These features make it a strong contender for server-side applications, web development, and much more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHow is Kotlin different from Java?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKotlin offers several improvements over Java to make coding easier and applications safer. It addresses many of Java\u0027s shortcomings, such as null pointer exceptions, checked exceptions, and verbose syntax. Kotlin also supports functional programming, coroutines for asynchronous programming, and comes with a powerful standard library, improving developers\u0027 productivity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIs Kotlin hard to learn?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKotlin is a language designed with developer productivity in mind. If you\u0027re familiar with Java or any other object-oriented language, you\u0027ll find Kotlin\u0027s syntax and concepts familiar and intuitive. Its concise and expressive syntax often makes it easier to understand and write, making Kotlin an accessible language for beginners and experienced developers alike.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECan I develop Android apps using Kotlin?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbsolutely! Kotlin is now the preferred language for Android development, as stated by Google. Kotlin simplifies Android development by making your code more concise, reducing bugs, and offering modern APIs for Android development, such as coroutines for asynchronous tasks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat are coroutines in Kotlin?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECoroutines are a standout feature in Kotlin that simplify asynchronous and non-blocking programming. They\u0027re lightweight threads that don\u0027t incur the usual high cost associated with threads. With coroutines, you can write code that\u0027s easier to read and understand, with fewer callbacks and a more sequential style, even when performing complex asynchronous operations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat is null safety in Kotlin?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKotlin aims to eliminate the Null Pointer Exceptions (NPEs), often termed as The Billion Dollar Mistake, by distinguishing nullable and non-nullable types. By default, Kotlin types can\u0027t hold a null value, reducing the risk of runtime NPEs. If you need a variable to hold a null value, you must explicitly declare it as nullable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDoes Kotlin replace Java?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKotlin is designed to be fully interoperable with Java and doesn\u0027t aim to replace it. Instead, it offers a modern language for the JVM and Android development that addresses many of Java\u0027s pain points. Developers can even maintain Java and Kotlin code in the same codebase, making transitioning between the two languages seamless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat kind of jobs can I get with Kotlin skills?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith Kotlin skills, you\u0027re eligible for a wide range of software development jobs.
