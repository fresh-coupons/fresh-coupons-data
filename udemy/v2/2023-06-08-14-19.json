Includes JSX, Callbacks, Events, \u002B More","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EThis course takes you step-by-step through the process of building a fully functional calculator in React. React, also known as React JS, is a powerful JavaScript library used for building custom, interactive user interfaces using UI components. Some of the most well known examples of organizations using React for their front-end include Netflix, Facebook, and Airbnb. Developed and maintained by Meta along with a community of independent developers, React remains free and open-source. React is a component based library built entirely on JavaScript, which makes it perfect for designing complex UI\u2019s. With React, developers can build encapsulated components that efficiently manage their own state and render UI updates specifically when data changes. For example, think of the automated content refresh feature you see on a twitter feed, or facebook like button. Here the state of the UI component changes on the page, without having to manually refresh when the data is updated. This is just one small, yet powerful feature of React.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThrough a complete hands-on project, this course will teach you all the fundamental principles of React that you must know to become a proficient React developer. We start right from the basics, including the tools needed to get started. From there we dive into JSX, functional components, props, callbacks, and various OnClick events. By this stage, the calculator will have a complete visual display, coupled with functional arithmetic operations. Students then move on to passing parameters in Callback functions, using the React State Hook, and debugging.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn addition to the hands-on React module, we also offer a comprehensive overview of JavaScript for those who need a refresher. Here we start with introducing students to the document object model (DOM) which defines the logical structure of HTML documents. From there we dive into JavaScript to demonstrate various methods in which DOM elements can be manipulated to add interactivity to static components. We start right from the basics, which includes JavaScript placement, and data output. From there we move on to variable declaration, arithmetic operations, operator precedence, data types, and objects. Once the foundations are covered, we move on to more complex operations using Arrays, Conditional Statements, JavaScript comparison operators, booleans and loops. Here students will learn to unleash the true power of JavaScript to render different outcomes based on user interaction. We will explore the use of functions to efficiently handle repetitive tasks and JavaScript events to handle output based on actions and occurrences. The section will conclude with a hands-on project where students will implement their knowledge to build a web based photo gallery and background color changer. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAs you can see this course covers a tremendous bit of ground.

The course starts with an in-depth overview of HTML where we start by exploring the structure of an HTML web page. Once you\u2019re comfortable with HTML foundations, we move on to demonstrating how to work with a number of HTML elements. This includes: Inline text elements, ordered and unordered lists, embedding media, link creation, tables, background images, form elements and iframes. The HTML segment concludes with a hands-on project that will guide you through creating a complete web page with headers, footers, callouts, images, links, forms and tabular data. By the end of the HTML segment, you\u2019ll be able to proficiently code simple and complex html pages with ease.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe second section of this course focuses exclusively on CSS to bring your web pages to life with custom style sheets. Here, students will learn the importance of responsive design and cross browser compatibility by embedding CSS style rules for individual page components. We start by exploring the parts, and types of CSS rules followed by an introduction into CSS Id\u2019s and divisions. From there we move on to CSS margins, text properties, borders, transparency and text on top of images. Once you have a handle on the foundations we move on to more intricate CSS concepts including CSS positioning, CSS float properties, Link Styling, and z-indexes. Similar to the HTML section, the CSS segment concludes with a comprehensive hands-on guide to building a responsive web page, complete with CSS style definitions, element containers, navigation, and a number of other CSS page elements.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOnce you have a foundational understanding of HTML and CSS, we will dive into working with React, a powerful JavaScript library used for front-end UI development. The React section starts off with a hands-on project where you\u2019ll learn how to work with functional React components, props, Callback functions, OnClick Events, and the React State hook to build a fully functional calculator. From there we will dive into project number two, where you will build a connect-4 clone. Here we will cover more intermediate concepts including passing props, destructuring, passing arguments to click events, various styling methods, and handling callbacks. You will also learn about the React key property, React lifecycle events, and conditional rendering. By the end you will have built a complete multi and single player connect-4 game board with built-in AI capabilities.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn the final section of the course we further unleash the power of React by building out a complete e-commerce site with multiple product categories, a product showcase, shopping cart feature, and much more. Here, we introduce a number of integral new concepts including: JSON server, Fetch API, and installing React router. These essential building blocks will be used to render the product categories, style the product list, and configure the product details page. From there we dive into styled components, refactoring the shop layout, and exploring the concept of \u201Ccontext\u201D in React. In the final stages of the project students will configure the shopping cart basket, and the checkout feature. We will also implement a product search feature, followed by in-depth exercises on validating input forms in React.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAs you can see this course covers a tremendous bit of ground.

This course provides an in-depth overview of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). The EC2 service is an essential building block in becoming an AWS certified cloud practitioner. We will start with exploring key concepts relevant to EC2, followed by a hands-on practical guide to deploying compute resources on AWS. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe term \u201CScalable Cloud Computing\u201D has now become synonymous with Amazon Web Services. For nearly a decade, AWS has been powering some of the world\u2019s most popular websites and applications. Amazon EC2, is considered the computational backbone of AWS.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ETo illustrate how Amazon EC2 works, we explore the concept of virtualization. Virtualization is the process of creating a software-based virtual representation of a server. When we deploy an EC2 \u201CInstance\u201D we\u2019re creating a virtual representation of a physical server and it\u2019s resources.\u003Cstrong\u003E \u003C/strong\u003EThis includes: CPU, Memory (RAM), Storage, and network resources such as Bandwidth. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ESimilar to physical servers that you might find on-premises,\u003Cstrong\u003E \u003C/strong\u003Evirtual EC2 instances can also have different configurations.

Not all cloud services were created equal. AWS, is known to have the highest level of configuration options when compared to just about any other service. The AWS platform caters to both micro and enterprise level clients, using one of the most scalable and advanced virtualization infrastructures available.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EBeyond the physical hardware customization and scalability, virtualization also accommodates the deployment of any operating system on the virtual machine. As you will see, we have the flexibility of deploying both Linux and Windows servers, using a variety of pre-configured virtual applications known as AMIs (Amazon Machine Images).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to a theoretical deep dive into Amazon EC2, this course will also provide you with practical hands-on experience in working with the key features of EC2.

Here, you will learn how to deploy fully scalable React web apps on some of the most powerful cloud computing platforms available, including AWS and Linode. The course starts with exploring the foundations of cloud computing where we dive into a comprehensive overview of the three main cloud service models. This includes: Infrastructure as a Service, Platform as a Service, and Software as a Service. From there we offer an in-depth guide to deploying and configuring virtual instances and the foundations of remote server administration and server security using SSH. Students are then introduced to Linux, where we explore various Linux distributions, the Linux filesystem, and essential Linux maintenance and directory commands. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOnce students have a handle on working with Linux, we\u2019ll dive into the foundations of Web Servers. Here, we\u2019ll explore two industry leaders in the server software space including Apache and NGINX. Students will learn the benefits and use cases of each server technology, combined with an in-depth technical analysis of their performance in production environments. From there we\u2019ll explore database management systems, including both SQL and NoSQL databases, coupled with database transaction standards. In this section students gain valuable insights into a variety of different database options available, and the best use case for each depending on the project type and complexity. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWith a firm handle on the theoretical aspects of web servers and DBMSes, we jump into a practical guide to setting up LAMP stack on Ubuntu through terminal for MacOS and PuTTY for Windows. Here we configure Linux with Apache, MariaDB, and PHP. Students will also learn how to upload data to a MariaDB database, and fetch records from within PHP scripts. The course then takes a theoretical and practical deep dive into server security. Here, we explore both network and hosted firewalls. We emphasize the pitfalls of lax server configurations, and provide a step-by-step guide to enabling and setting up UFW for Ubuntu. Students will also learn how to configure custom ports for SSH tunneling as an added layer of security.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe second half of the course provides a comprehensive guide to Amazon Web Services. We start with demonstrating how to setup, secure, and navigate an AWS account. This includes setting up billing alerts and multi-factor authentication. From there, we take a deep dive into AWS Identity and Access management for enhanced account security, and the management of user accounts for various AWS services. Here we explore IAM User management and permissions, IAM Groups, IAM Policies, and access key rotation. Following the IAM section, we\u2019ll jump into the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) service. In this module students lean to deploy virtual instances on AWS using Amazon Machine Images, Elastic IPs, and Launch Templates. We will also explore IAM roles for EC2, EC2 Security Groups, SSH key pair authentication, and remote administration using both terminal and EC2 Instance connect. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAfter students have a mastery of cloud computing, the next segment explores the development and deployment of interactive web apps using both JavaScript and React. Here we start with JavaScript foundations including the document object model, and DOM manipulation. From there, we hop into JavaScript variables, arithmetic operations, data types, objects, arrays, loops, functions, and events. The JavaScript section concludes with two hands-on projects where students build a background color changer, and photo gallery. After completion of the JavaScript section, students will use their new found skills to build out dynamic front-end UI components using the React JS library. Through a series of hands-on projects, students will build a calculator, Connect-4 Game clone, and a fully customizable e-commerce site. The react modules start from the basics and work up to several intermediate level concepts. This includes: working with code pen, JSX, Functional components, Props, Callbacks, Events, the React State hook, conditional rendering, Fetch API, Refactoring, and much more. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAs you can see this course covers a tremendous bit of ground.

Students also learn the basics of AWS billing, global vs. regional services, and AWS multi-factor authentication (MFA). \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOnce students are familiar with navigating the AWS dashboard, we dive into working with the EC2 service. Here we explore the core features of EC2 instances, along with instance deployment, instance administration, and security. Students will learn how to create and deploy instances from Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) that are fully equipped with Elastic IP addresses, and remote access via terminal and PuTTY. We also cover a host of other integral concepts including IAM roles for EC2, Security Groups, and EC2 Instance Launch Templates. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAfter the EC2 section, we delve into AWS EC2 storage solutions. Here, we start with exploring the key differences between block, file, and object storage. From there, we take a deep dive into Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS). EBS is a block storage service provided by AWS which allows for the creation of virtual disks, called EBS volumes that can be attached to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances. These EBS volumes can be used as raw block devices, in order to store data, such as system files, application data, and virtual machine images. We will cover how to create, attach, and manage EBS volumes, as well as how to use EBS Snapshots to create point-in-time backups of your data. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EFrom there, we explore Amazon Machine Images (AMIs), which are templates that contain the software configuration and data required to launch an EC2 instance. We will cover how to create and customize AMIs, as well as how to use the EC2 Image Builder to automate the creation of AMIs. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn the last section, we introduce students to the Elastic File System (EFS), which is a file storage service provided by AWS. EFS allows you to create a file system that can be accessed by multiple EC2 instances to store and share files across multiple availability zones. We will cover how to create and manage EFS file systems, as well as how to mount EFS file systems on your EC2 instances. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EBy the end of this course, you will have a solid understanding of the various storage options available on AWS, and you will be able to confidently choose the right storage solution for your needs. You will also have the skills and knowledge to effectively manage and optimize your storage on AWS, ensuring that your data is safe, secure, and accessible.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIf you\u2019re excited about learning everything you need to know about AWS EC2 storage, hit the enroll button and let\u2019s get started.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/master-amazon-ec2-storage-complete-guide-for-ebs-efs-ami/","imageUri":"https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4925150_1295.jpg","duration":"5.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"7,783.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Students interested in Cloud Computing with AWS","Students interested in learning the foundations of Amazon Web Services","Students interested in Mastering the Amazon EC2 Service","Students interested in Mastering EC2 Storage Solutions: ELB, EFS, AMI"],"tags":["Cloud Computing","AWS Config"],"rating":{"count":17,"averageValue":"4.4"},"instructors":[{"name":"YouAccel Training","url":"/user/youaccel/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.382353}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"YOUACCEL80086","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-xml-ajax-for-beginners/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":2337818,"title":"Learn XML-AJAX - For Beginners","shortDescription":"Learn to create interactive web applications using AJAX","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECourse: Learn XML-AJAX - For Beginners\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003ELearn to create interactive web applications using AJAX\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStudents learn to integrate XML/AJAX into their applications to seamlessly relay information from client-to-server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe explore several methods to update page content, without page reload.

This course has been designed by a lifelong astrology student of 25\u002B years, who has studied both Western and Sidereal Techniques. Your course teacher initially embraced the study of astrology in the early 1990s, after beating terminal cancer continued their spiritual journey through Nadi Sidereal Astrology from 2010 until today. In addition, my research has taken me on long-distance journeys where I\u2019ve studied the effects of Astrocartography. I have used astrology to better understand and manage mental illness and chronic diseases, I have used it to predict my marriage and I love to use it in business on the stock market. This science should be analyzed from all angles possible to give a more accurate prediction.

And they do exists!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have used astrology to understand many things in my own life from mental illness (genetic) to incurable diseases such as cancer, and use it on a regular basis in my daily life for the Stockmarket (Disclaimer* not a financial advisor), for choosing auspicious days to have surgery or signs contracts and buying my lotto tickets. I\u0027ve enjoyed traveling and documenting both my husband\u0027s and my experience with Astro-Cartography in at least 12 countries together. I have been conducting private research on mental illness and cancer. It is my hope one day that we might just use astrology to help diagnose someone early before a terminal stage of cancer. Like myself, I was diagnosed with metastatic ovarian cancer at only 28 around my Saturn return in the first house. No, that one statement does not mean you\u0027ll get cancer.*** \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI still believe western medicine and experienced surgeons help save my life.

Transmission genetics (sometimes called classical\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Egenetics) is the subdiscipline dealing with how genes\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand genetic traits are transmitted from generation to\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Egeneration and how genes recombine (exchange be-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etween chromosomes).
