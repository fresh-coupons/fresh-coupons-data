Do you want to build something awesome? Something amazing? Are you a web developer who wants a cool job? If so, then this course is for you. In this course, you will learn how to build a complete forum from the ground up in a few hours. I already made sure that every part of this course is concise, elegant, and informative, so don\u0027t miss out on this cool opportunity.

And then we are going to build a full authentication system from scratch. While building this system I am going to introduce you to hashing and dehashing passwords. And then, we are going to build general and cool features inside our own app. We are going to build the topics system. And in this section, I am going to show you how to create, update, show, and delete topics in an easy manner. And now that every topic has a reply we are going to build the replies system so users will be allowed to create and update and delete their own replies. After all of this, we are going to move to other parts of the forum and they are general parts that are related to categories, topics, and replies. Also, there is a section where we are going to take care of the profile system. And then we will dive deeper into creating the admin panel.
