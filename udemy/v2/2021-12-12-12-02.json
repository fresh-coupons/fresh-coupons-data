There is often a disconnection between sales and marketing departments in many businesses. This is typically due to a lack of interaction or shared attention.

AI can point out positive sales leads, which will also satisfy marketing, and ensure that potential customers are targeted at the right platforms. You don\u0027t want the company that sells accounting software to be advertised by someone. All teams will need to come together and agree on an optimal customer profile, a profile that fits marketing and sales, to better use AI in the B2B lead generation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe profile can consist of multiple variables, such as sector, company level, and how many employees they have.

However, while AI and machine learning are rapidly altering our environment and propelling the Fourth Industrial Revolution, humanity does not need to be concerned.

AI is believed to become the biggest business opportunity of the next decade and many more decades to come. The rise of AI will not be a threat in this new world order; rather, it will be a tremendous benefit. Not only is AI poised to impact the future of every single person and organisation in the world, but it is also poised to change the future of whole countries\u0027 governments, politics, and economies. As we move toward a world of totally automated work, we\u0027ll need to start adopting new rules and ideas. We\u0027ll have to start thinking about the future more than we do now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Future of Jobs in the 21st Century:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 21st century is inching toward what many believe is the singularity or the time when manual work will all die out. There are still many jobs that we will have on our resume, but they will be less glamorous, fewer in number, and have little to do with our lives. We\u0027ll have far more disposable income, but it will be much greater still. The work, which will often be a repetitive, uninteresting and boring part of our jobs, will be replaced by the jobs of a new, automated digital future. This new age of automation and digital replacement will be of tremendous benefit to everyone but the workers themselves. The work will be performed on smart cloud computers and brilliantly capable-intelligent devices, which should offer us less of a challenge than ever before in recent history. If the future is any indication, a new and entirely digital world is now on the horizon. We are already seeing the results of this transition, with computers working across disciplines and tasks. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the newest and most amazing technologies is 3D printing, a process that is being used to create amazing items of art. This may not be practical, but it is something new that is just beginning to be experienced. People are inventing more and more advanced ways of creating things, not just for themselves, but for others. Even more incredible, our ability to design and create artificial intelligence and machines with their own personalities and motivations is being brought into the picture. As we make the machines smarter and more capable, each individual will have a role that is different than they would in any other scenario of the future. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany people see artificial intelligence as a danger, and they see the power of artificial intelligence in our personal lives, in our jobs, in our families. Artificial intelligence has created problems for many people. There is another possibility that has come along that we can think is a bit better, to begin with than what we are seeing today. One such possibility is a group that believes it can reverse engineer human DNA and then create a new biological \u0022self.\u0022 For this to happen, however, scientists first have to figure out a way to reverse engineer human DNA. Since we don\u0027t have the technological capability to reverse engineer human DNA today, this can be an extremely difficult path for anyone to take. The solution might not even be discovered until very late in the game until hundreds of years to come, however, and perhaps even we could lose much of our future. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s now talk about digital mind clone software where we can store our thoughts and ideas.

It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat is the Linear regression technique of Machine learning?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELinear Regression is a simple machine learning model for regression problems, i.e., when the target variable is a real value.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELinear regression is a linear model, e.g. a model that assumes a linear relationship between the input variables (x) and the single output variable (y). More specifically, that y can be calculated from a linear combination of the input variables (x).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen there is a single input variable (x), the method is referred to as simple linear regression.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen there are multiple input variables, the method is known as multiple linear regression.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy learn Linear regression technique of Machine learning?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are four reasons to learn Linear regression technique of Machine learning:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Linear Regression is the most popular machine learning technique\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Linear Regression has fairly good prediction accuracy\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Linear Regression is simple to implement and easy to interpret\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. It gives you a firm base to start learning other advanced techniques of Machine Learning\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHow much time does it take to learn Linear regression technique of machine learning?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELinear Regression is easy but no one can determine the learning time it takes. It totally depends on you. The method we adopted to help you learn Linear regression starts from the basics and takes you to advanced level within hours. You can follow the same, but remember you can learn nothing without practicing it. Practice is the only way to remember whatever you have learnt. Therefore, we have also provided you with another data set to work on as a separate project of Linear regression.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat are the steps I should follow to be able to build a Machine Learning model?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can divide your learning process into 4 parts:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStatistics and Probability - Implementing Machine learning techniques require basic knowledge of Statistics and probability concepts.

But read on to find out why we can be confident in making it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESo just what is eCommerce?\u003C/strong\u003E Of course, the term refers to online commerce: i.e. selling products online.\u003Cbr\u003EBut while eCommerce could mean selling an eBook from a landing page, it is most often used to refer more exclusively to online shops that sell multiple products and that have a particular layout and set-up. The most popular example of an \u003Cstrong\u003EeCommerce store \u003C/strong\u003Eis undoubtedly Amazon. This acts just like a high street store and allows you to browse products at your leisure and add them to a shopping cart. The only difference is that you can do all this from the comfort of your home and once you check out, the products are the simply delivered to you wherever you are.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIt\u2019s a familiar concept, but what makes it so important?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy eCommerce is the Future\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E#1 eCommerce is Growing\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/strong\u003EThe first thing you need to recognize is that eCommerce is growing. In the early days, people were uncertain about spending money online and found that it was daunting handing over their card details and trusting in a supplier that they couldn\u2019t meet face to face.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EBut now look at companies like Amazon and eBay. These are household names around the world and everyone from the young and tech savvy to the elderly are now happy to shop with them. These companies have helped many people to put aside any concerns they might have had regarding eCommerce and to trust in buying online.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAnd eCommerce is growing as well doing massive business.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EFor proof, you need look no further than stats from \u2018Cyber Monday\u2019. Cyber Monday is a national holiday of sorts where online retailers are anticipated to lower their prices. It follows Black Friday but these days it tends to do nearly as much business \u2013 and it\u2019s growing rapidly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EFor example, in 2014 Cyber Monday created a total of $2.59 billion sales online. That\u2019s no small number but in 2015 this was increased to $3.19 billion. That\u2019s a huge increase. $2.28 billion of these were on desktop (versus $2.04 billion last year) while $838 million were through mobile devices (versus $548 million).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAcross all devices, Cyber Monday increased by 21%!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ESeeing as Amazon is probably the best known online retailer, how is its growth going? Well, the company sold a total of $107.01 billion worth of products in 2015. The company employees 230,800 and there are 304 million active Amazon customer accounts. The brand is worth $47.73 billion and this is only expected to continue to grow as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe story is the same across the board. People are becoming more and more familiar with eCommerce and high-street stores are struggling. This is undoubtedly the future of selling and it\u2019s easy to see why.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E#2 It\u2019s Convenient\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/strong\u003ESo what is it that has led to such growth in eCommerce? Well, the simple fact of the matter is that online sales benefit everyone. The only reason online sales haven\u2019t already dwarfed physical sales is probably the fact that some people still don\u2019t trust shopping online or aren\u2019t sure how to go about it. Over time this concern will be eroded more and more \u2013 while tools like PayPal will make it easier and safer than ever before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWhen you sell products online, it means that you don\u2019t have to employ staff and you don\u2019t have to rent the same amount of physical space. You\u2019ll need somewhere to store your products (unless you\u2019re drop shipping) but other than that, your only costs will be hosting, shipping and web design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ELower overheads mean more profit for you but they also mean lower prices for customers. Customers now have the ability to order products online conveniently but on top of that, they\u2019ll be getting them for a much lower price.\u003Cbr\u003EThere\u2019s also greater versatility in terms of what you can sell. With an eCommerce store you can sell physical products which will require some up-front investment. But\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThere\u2019s also a lot less up-front cost. If you wanted to set up a high-street store, then you would need to be willing to spend a large amount of money to rent the physical space, to invest in the stock and to manage staff etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EHowever, if you are setting up an online store then all you\u2019re going to need is some inventory to sell (perhaps not if you are going to be selling digital products or acting as an affiliate) and a website. It takes just a few clicks to set up an eCommerce store and that means you can have one up and running in minutes for a negligible cost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E#3 It\u2019s the Best Way to Monetize a Website\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/strong\u003EThe last two examples explain why businesses should launch their own eCommerce stores and why you might consider launching an eCommerce store as your business. But you should also sit up and take notice if you run a blog or website already and you\u2019re just looking for a way to monetize it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWhy? Because it\u2019s actually one of the most effective methods there is of making money from an eCommerce website.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EUntil now, you likely have been relying on one of several methods to make money online. Perhaps you\u2019re making ads from advertising on your website (Google AdSense for example) or maybe you\u2019re making money by selling an affiliate product.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn either of those scenarios, it\u2019s important to recognize that you have placed yourself at the bottom of the \u2018foodchain\u2019. In other words, you\u2019re being paid by those advertisers and\u0026nbsp;product creators in order to send business their way. The fact that they\u2019re happy to continue paying you, means that they\u2019re making more money that that from you. In other words, they\u2019re earning more from your visitors than you are! You\u2019re getting a small share of their profit but they\u2019re taking home the lion\u2019s share. And in fact, you\u2019re essentially doing their work for them!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAnd that\u2019s why you\u2019ll typically earn about 1-50 cents per click on an advert. Meaning in turn that you\u2019re going to need hundreds of thousands of visitors to your site a day to make any reasonable money. Compare this with selling your own products and making $20-50 each time. Of course, it\u2019s much easier to get someone to click on an advert than it is to get them to buy something \u2013 but not as much easier as you think if you have decent products and you\u2019re running your store well. The bottom line? You can make a living from a website with just a few hundred daily visitors instead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIf you have an eCommerce website, then the buck stops with you. Now you\u2019re making the maximum profit from your customers because you\u2019re selling something to them and keeping the difference. What\u2019s more, is that you\u2019re keeping your visitors on your eCommerce website and engaged with your brand. You\u2019re not sending them away, you\u2019re keeping them right where you want them and making a real difference to the way they see you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EFinally, selling eCommerce products is better than selling digital products or affiliate products because it\u2019s something that anyone can appreciate. Only a very specific type of person buys eBooks about making money online. Phone cases and clothes though? That has a much broader appeal!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ETry putting an eCommerce website on your existing website and just see what a difference it makes to your profits.

The benefits of working online are many and varied and\nextend into every aspect of your life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut in order for you to make the very most from this way of working, you\u0026nbsp;also need to make sure you choose the perfect business model. Working\u0026nbsp;online on its own does not necessarily equate to an ideal lifestyle; rather\nthe benefits come when you work online in the right way. And let me tell\u0026nbsp;you: creating a membership site is definitely the right way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Working online is easy. If you are in a job that\u2019s fairly flexible, then you\u0026nbsp;should be able to ask your employer if you can work from home and simply\u0026nbsp;log into the company\u2019s network whenever you start working. And sure, this will bring some benefits: you\u2019ll be able to stay in bed longer and stop commuting and you\u2019ll have the luxury of\u0026nbsp;being able to drink tea, listen to\u0026nbsp;music and generally create a comfortable environment.\u0026nbsp; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut you\u2019re still ultimately a slave to your job. You\u2019re still trading \u2018time for\u0026nbsp;hours\u2019 and you\u2019ll still need to be available for the hours between 9am-5pm. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u2019ll probably also need to be near the phone and you\u2019ll be expected to\u0026nbsp;output a certain amount of work every day. That means you probably can\u2019t\u0026nbsp;leave the house and work outdoors in case you lose your internet\u0026nbsp;connection. And it means you can decide to stop working for the day and\u0026nbsp;visit a friend instead. Worst of all, you can still be \u2018told off\u2019 by your boss \u2013\u0026nbsp;reprimanded like a child! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe same goes for creating your own online business. If you\u2019re a web\u0026nbsp;designer for example, then you have the freedom to decide when you work\u0026nbsp;on projects. But you probably still have deadlines and to all extents and\u0026nbsp;purposes, your clients are your bosses. If you fail to complete \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is why so many people find the idea of blogging desirable. All you\u0026nbsp;have to do is to create and manage a website that you hopefully find\u0026nbsp;fascinating and really enjoy writing about. You\u2019ll get to experience a lot of the satisfaction that comes from running your own business. And you get\u0026nbsp;passive income, meaning that you\u2019ll earn money while you sleep.\u0026nbsp;But even this isn\u2019t perfect. Because one day, you might earn $200 and the\u0026nbsp;next day you might earn $10.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nIt only takes a change to Google\u2019s search algorithm and you can lose all of\u0026nbsp;your progress. What\u2019s more, is that it takes actually a huge amount of time\u0026nbsp;to build up the amount of traffic that you need to make a big profit from a\u0026nbsp;blog. This is especially true if you are planning to use pay-per-click\u0026nbsp;advertising but it\u2019s equally the case if you are selling your own product.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThink about it: how often do you click ads on other websites? This is why it\u0026nbsp;typically takes 1K visitors for you to generate just one or two clicks and the\u0026nbsp;same goes for sales of products. It\u2019s a huge amount of work before you\u0026nbsp;start earning anything and there\u2019s no guarantee it will ever get to the point\u0026nbsp;where it can provide a livable salary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnter: Recurring, Passive Income\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is where membership site come in and offer an incredibly appealing alternative. Essentially, a membership website is a site that users pay to subscribe to. This normally works by first enticing the reader with some free content and showing them the kind of entertainment/information/value that you\u2019re capable of providing. Once they\u2019re hooked, you then make sure they know that they need to subscribe in order to gain access to your very best content and to get frequently updated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what\u2019s so different about this? Well for starters, it means that you can\u0026nbsp;much more easily convert visitors to paying customers seeing as they\u2019re\u0026nbsp;not having to put down a large amount of money and seeing as they know\u0026nbsp;what they\u2019re getting right away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore importantly, though, it means that the money is recurring and much\u0026nbsp;more predictable. Unlike a regular blog that can very much fluctuate,\u0026nbsp;having subscribers means you probably have some kind of agreement or\u0026nbsp;standing order set up. This means that you can practically guarantee that\u0026nbsp;you\u2019ll be able to earn a set amount of money each week, month or quarter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that very quickly starts to add up\u2026\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo say you currently have people subscribing for $5 membership a month. If your\u0026nbsp;content is good, then you could realistically convince one in every 1-10,000\u0026nbsp;people to sign up. But it\u2019s very possible the very first person who visits\u0026nbsp;might sign up! There\u2019s an element of luck but as soon as you get that first\u0026nbsp;membership you\u2019re in business \u2013 and $5 membership a month quickly adds up to $60 a\u0026nbsp;year.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEventually, you can work whenever you like and add as much content as\u0026nbsp;you like (we\u2019ll look at how later on) and\u0026nbsp;still know for sure that you\u2019ll be able\u0026nbsp;to earn X amount of money per month and per year. This is very much\u0026nbsp;living the dream \u2013 all the freedom of passive incomes but with all the\u0026nbsp;security of a well-paid job!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan people unsubscribe? Sure they can! But the likelihood of everyone\u0026nbsp;unsubscribing all at once is incredibly\u0026nbsp;slim and in most cases you\u2019ll have\u0026nbsp;more new visitors signing up than old visitors leaving.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat You Will Learn\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis course is going to explain in great detail exactly how you go about creating your own membership website.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe\u2019ll see how to build a membership website, how to make sure that people want to subscribe, how to implement a recurring\u0026nbsp;fee and how to thrive in this market space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat we\u2019ll also see is that there are multiple membership business models that can work online when you know\u0026nbsp;how.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe\u2019ll look at a selection so that you can decide on the perfect type of membership site/content for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUltimately, we\u2019re going to give you the tools to take the subjects that you love and then turn them into a stable\u0026nbsp;source of income that will pay out even while you\u2019re sleeping.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpecifically, you will learn:\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\uF0B7 How to create a membership website or blog\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\uF0B7 How to turn your site into a membership site\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\uF0B7 How to make content that will make people want to subscribe\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\uF0B7 How to promote your membership\u0026nbsp; site\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\uF0B7 How to price your membership site\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\uF0B7 How to add extra monetization to your offering\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\uF0B7 How to create a membership app\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\uF0B7 How to create membership video\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\uF0B7 The importance of building a community\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\uF0B7 How to use quizzes and other forms of media\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\uF0B7 What you can learn from the best membership sites\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\uF0B7 The strategies and tools you can learn to succeed even beyond those\u2026\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\uF0B7 And much more!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKindly note that this is a 100% informational guide, there are no \u201COn-Screen how to steps\u201D.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"\u0130ngilizce","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/membership-empire-recurring-home-business-model/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/1050278_8ce5_2.jpg","duration":"2,5 saat","enrolledStudentsCount":"32.965 \u00F6\u011Frenci","lastUpdated":"Son g\u00FCncelleme tarihi: 11/2021","targetAudiences":["Beginners who wants to make passive, recurring income online","Anyone preferring captioned videos","This course is not for students who wants \u0022On-Screen show how\u0022 - The course is strictly 100% informational","Anyone who wants to build recurring income","Anyone willing to put in the work and reap the rewards","Anyone who wants to make a bigger difference by getting their expertise online","Bloggers, business owners, sport trainers , coaches, consultants, speakers, and authors who want to impact the lives of a wider audience!","\u2022 9-5 workers who want to make side income."],"tags":["\u0130\u015Fletme","Di\u011Fer \u0130\u015Fletme","\u00DCyelik Sitesi"],"rating":{"count":69,"averageValue":"4.5"},"instructors":[{"name":"OMG - Mastermind","url":"/user/kareem-23/","totalNumberOfStudents":301586,"totalNumberOfReviews":5719,"averageRating":4.317422424010554}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"388BD1726F08A7680274","originalPrice":"12.800\u00A0INR","discountedPrice":"9.600\u00A0INR","expirationText":"2 d\u00EDas","discountPercentage":25}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/youtube-marketing-empire-the-blueprint-to-youtube-marketing/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":1252336,"title":"YouTube Marketing Empire: The Blueprint to YouTube Marketing","shortDescription":"Beginner Guide on How to Drive Unlimited YouTube Targeted Traffic That Converts Using YouTube Marketing Experts Strategy","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETwo Certificates for the Price of One!
