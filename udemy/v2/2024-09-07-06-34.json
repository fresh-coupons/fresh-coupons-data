In order to achieve this goal, it is necessary to design lessons in which students take an active role, rather than merely receiving it. Teachers guide class discussions, pose thought-provoking questions, and assign assignments that call on students to work together and think critically.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESection 2: Learning through Solving Problems\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThinking classrooms emphasise problem-based learning (PBL), in which students work on real-world issues with complicated and non-trivial answers. This approach promotes analytical thinking, innovative problem-solving, and teamwork among pupils. PBL helps students gain a more thorough grasp of the material and improves their problem-solving ability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Learning Through Collaboration\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThinking classrooms rely on collaboration. Student group work aims to solve problems collaboratively, share ideas, and exchange viewpoints. This collaborative approach exposes students to many perspectives and problem-solving methods and helps them develop their social and communication skills.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition, the module talks about 1. Student Engagement\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the fundamental principles of a thinking classroom is active student engagement. This involves creating an environment where students are not just passive recipients of information but active participants in the learning process. Teachers facilitate discussions, encourage questions, and provide tasks that require critical thinking and collaboration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Problem-Based Learning\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThinking classrooms prioritize problem-based learning (PBL), where students tackle complex, real-world problems that don\u2019t have straightforward solutions. This method encourages students to think critically, apply their knowledge creatively, and collaborate with peers to find solutions. PBL fosters a deeper understanding of the subject matter and enhances problem-solving skills.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Collaborative Learning\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECollaboration is a critical component of thinking classrooms. Students work in groups to discuss ideas, share different perspectives, and collectively solve problems. This collaborative approach improves social and communication skills and exposes students to diverse ways of thinking and problem-solving.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImplementing Thinking Classrooms\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Random Grouping\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThinking classrooms often use random grouping to ensure that all students interact with different peers and perspectives. Changing groups regularly prevents cliques and promotes inclusivity. This strategy encourages students to develop interpersonal skills and learn from diverse viewpoints.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Vertical Non-Permanent Surfaces (VNPS)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing VNPS, such as whiteboards or chalkboards on walls, allows students to stand and work on problems collaboratively. This setup promotes active engagement, makes students\u2019 thinking visible, and facilitates immediate feedback from peers and teachers. VNPS helps to break down the traditional classroom hierarchy and encourages a more dynamic and interactive learning environment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/building-thinking-classrooms/","imageUri":"https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/6025426_ed0a.jpg","duration":"1 total hour","enrolledStudentsCount":"1,035.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Educators and Parents"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":1,"averageValue":"5.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"Dr. Dheeraj Mehrotra","url":"/user/dr-dheeraj-mehrotra/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":5}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"D60A70C4F839178CFF4D","originalPrice":"\u20B91,799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/excel-excel-essential-with-tips-trick-and-job-success/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5689142,"title":"Excel - Excel Essentials Course For Beginners to Expert","shortDescription":"Learn Microsoft Excel From Scratch.

The conference is credited with helping to define the field of AI and to set the agenda for future research.","Artificial Intelligence \u201CAI\u201D is a complex field that needs the ability of people from diverse disciplines to work together. As an example, manufacturing autonomous vehicles like self-driving cars requires the work of people from different fields, such as AI Researchers, Automotive Engineers, and Computer Vision Researchers.  AI Researchers develop algorithms that enable self-driving cars to perceive their surroundings, make decisions, and control their movements. Automotive Engineers develop the hardware and software systems that are needed to implement these algorithms, and Computer Vision Researchers develop new techniques for enabling self-driving cars to see and understand the world.","What is Machine Learning?  Machine Learning is a type of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that allows computers to learn from data without explicit programming. In other words, machine learning algorithms can recognize patterns and make predictions based on data, without getting a command. This enables computers to learn new tasks and improve their performance over time without human intervention.","Where is Machine Learning used?  Machine learning is in use by a wide range of applications, including email filtering, Social Media Personalization, Image Recognition, Speech Recognition, fraud detection, Text prediction, Product recommendation, medical diagnosis, Healthcare Personalization, Traffic Prediction.","Neural networks are a type of machine learning algorithm that is inspired by the structure and function of the human brain.  Neural networks can learn complex patterns from data.  Neural networks have been successfully used in areas such as natural language processing.","Deep Learning is a type of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers.  Each layer consists of multiple nodes that can perform diverse tasks. This allows deep learning models to learn more complex patterns from data.  Deep learning has been used to achieve significant results in a wide range of tasks, including image recognition, speech recognition, and machine translation."],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":325,"averageValue":"4.3"},"instructors":[{"name":"MTF Institute of Management, Technology and Finance","url":"/user/mtfinstitute/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.230769}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"1257063391D1774F8565","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"3 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/global-career-development-job-search-interviewing-skills/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5682522,"title":"Global Career Development, Job Search, Interviewing Skills","shortDescription":"Global Career Development, Job Search, Interviewing, Resume and CV writing skills Course by MTF Institute","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWelcome to course: Global Career Development, Job Search, Interviewing, Resume and CV writing skills Course by MTF Institute\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECourse provided by \u003Cstrong\u003EMTF Institute of Management, Technology and Finance\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMTF\u003C/strong\u003E is the global educational and research institute with HQ at Lisbon, Portugal, focused on business \u0026amp; professional hybrid (on-campus and online) education at areas: Business \u0026amp; Administration, Science \u0026amp; Technology, Banking \u0026amp; Finance. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMTF R\u0026amp;D \u003C/strong\u003Ecenter focused on research activities at areas: Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Data Science, Big Data, WEB3, Blockchain, Cryptocurrency \u0026amp; Digital Assets, Metaverses, Digital Transformation, Fintech, Electronic Commerce, Internet of Things. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMTF\u003C/strong\u003E is the official partner of: IBM, Intel, Microsoft, member of the Portuguese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and resident of the incubator \u0022The Fintech House of Portugal\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMTF \u003C/strong\u003Eis present in 208 countries and has been chosen by more than 380,000 students.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECourse Author:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIgor Dmitriev\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDigital Business \u0026amp; Transformation Expert\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEducation:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u2022 MBA, The Boston University, USA\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u2022 Master of Science at Engineering (Technical) Management, The State University of New York at Buffalo, USA\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u2022 Master of Science at Informatics and Economics, The Saint- Petersburg State University of Finance and Economics\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u2022 Six Sigma Black Belt\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExperience:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u2022 Expert at Banking (\u0026gt;15 years), FinTech \u0026amp; Digital (\u0026gt;12 years).
