It emphasizes communication, collaboration, and shared responsibility to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.  Key Concepts:  Automation: Automating tasks like building, testing, and deployment.  Continuous Integration (CI): Frequently integrating code changes into a central repository.  Continuous Delivery (CD): Automating the release pipeline to ensure code can be rapidly and reliably deployed to production.  Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Managing infrastructure in a declarative manner, often using code, to automate provisioning and management.  Monitoring and Feedback: Continuous monitoring of applications and infrastructure to identify and address issues quickly.","Version Control  What it is: Version control systems (like Git) record changes to files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.  Benefits:  Collaboration: Multiple developers can work on the same codebase without conflicts.  History Tracking: See the complete history of changes, who made them, and when.  Rollback: Revert to previous versions if needed.  Branching and Merging: Experiment with new features without affecting the main codebase.","CI/CD  What it is: CI/CD is a set of practices that enable rapid and reliable software delivery through automation.  Key Components:  Continuous Integration (CI): Developers integrate code changes frequently, triggering automated builds and tests.

An ethical hacker tries to locate vulnerabilities in the network by testing different hacking techniques on them. In many situations, a network seems impenetrable only because it hasn\u2019t succumbed to an attack in years. However, this could be because black hat hackers are using the wrong kinds of methods. An ethical hacker can show a company how it may be vulnerable by levying a new type of attack that no one has ever tried before. When they successfully penetrate the system, the organization can then set up defenses to protect against this kind of penetration. This unique security opportunity makes the skills of an ethical hacker desirable for organizations that want to ensure their systems are well-defended against cyber criminals.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWhat skills do Ethical Hackers need to know?\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn addition to proficiency in basic computer skills and use of the command line, ethical hackers must also develop technical skills related to programming, database management systems (DBMS), use of the Linux operating system (OS), cryptography, creation and management of web applications and computer networks like DHCP, NAT, and Subnetting. Becoming an ethical hacker involves learning at least one programming language and having a working knowledge of other common languages like Python, SQL, C\u002B\u002B, and C. Ethical hackers must have strong problem-solving skills and the ability to think critically to come up with and test new solutions for securing systems. Ethical hackers should also understand how to use reverse engineering to uncover specifications and check a system for vulnerabilities by analyzing its code.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EWhy do hackers use Linux?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003EMany hackers use the Linux operating system (OS) because Linux is a free and open-source OS, meaning that anyone can modify it. It\u2019s easy to access and customize all parts of Linux, which allows a hacker more control over manipulating the OS. Linux also features a well-integrated command-line interface, giving users a more precise level of control than many other systems offer. While Linux is considered more secure than many other systems, some hackers can modify existing Linux security distributions to use them as hacking software. Most ethical hackers prefer Linux because it\u0027s considered more secure than other operating systems and does not generally require the use of third-party antivirus software. Ethical hackers must be well-versed in Linux to identify loopholes and combat malicious hackers, as it\u2019s one of the most popular systems for web servers.\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EWhat is the Certified Ethical Hacker ( CEH ) Certification Exam?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003EThe Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) certification exam supports and tests the knowledge of auditors, security officers, site administrators, security professionals, and anyone else who wants to ensure a network is safe against cyber criminals. With the CEH credential, you can design and govern the minimum standards necessary for credentialing information that security professionals need to engage in ethical hacking. You can also make it known to the public if someone who has earned their CEH credentials has met or exceeded the minimum standards. You are also empowered to reinforce the usefulness and self-regulated nature of ethical hacking. The CEH exam doesn\u2019t cater to specific security hardware or software vendors, such as Fortinet, Avira, Kaspersky, Cisco, or others, making it a vendor-neutral program.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWhat is the Certified Information Security Manager ( CISM ) exam?\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EPassing the Certified Information Security Manager (CISM) exam indicates that the credentialed individual is an expert in the governance of information security, developing security programs and managing them, as well as managing incidents and risks. For someone to be considered \u201Ccertified,\u201D they must have passed the exam within the last five years, as well as work full-time in a related career, such as information security and IT administration. The exam tests individuals\u2019 knowledge regarding the risks facing different systems, how to develop programs to assess and mitigate these risks, and how to ensure an organization\u0027s information systems conform to internal and regulatory policies. The exam also assesses how a person can use tools to help an organization recover from a successful attack.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EWhat are the different types of hackers?\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe different types of hackers include white hat hackers who are ethical hackers and are authorized to hack systems, black hat hackers who are cyber criminals, and grey hat hackers, who fall in-between and may not damage your system but hack for personal gain. There are also red hat hackers who attack black hat hackers directly. Some call new hackers green hat hackers. These people aspire to be full-blown, respected hackers. State-sponsored hackers work for countries and hacktivists and use hacking to support or promote a philosophy. Sometimes a hacker can act as a whistleblower, hacking their organization to expose hidden practices. There are also script kiddies and blue hat hackers. A script kiddie tries to impress their friends by launching scripts and downloading tools to take down websites and networks.

Ethical hackers and security experts carry out these tests to find any weak spots in a system\u2019s security before hackers with malicious intent find them and exploit them. Someone who has no previous knowledge of the system\u0027s security usually performs these tests, making it easier to find vulnerabilities that the development team may have overlooked. You can perform penetration testing using manual or automated technologies to compromise servers, web applications, wireless networks, network devices, mobile devices, and other exposure points.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat are the different types of penetration testing?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThere are many types of penetration testing. Internal penetration testing tests an enterprise\u0027s internal network. This test can determine how much damage can be caused by an employee. An external penetration test targets a company\u0027s externally facing technology like its website or its network. Companies use these tests to determine how an anonymous hacker can attack a system. In a covert penetration test, also known as a double-blind penetration test, few people in the company will know that a pen test is occurring, including any security professional. This type of test will test not only systems but a company\u0027s response to an active attack. With a closed-box penetration test, a hacker may know nothing about the enterprise under attack other than its name. In an open-box test, the hacker will receive some information about a company\u0027s security to aid them in the attack.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWhat are the different stages of penetration testing?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EPenetration tests have five different stages. The first stage defines the goals and scope of the test and the testing methods that will be used. Security experts will also gather intelligence on the company\u0027s system to better understand the target. The second stage of a pen test is scanning the target application or network to determine how it will respond to an attack. You can do this through a static analysis of application code and dynamic scans of running applications and networks. The third stage is the attack phase when possible vulnerabilities discovered in the last stage are attacked with various hacking methods. In the fourth stage of a penetration test, the tester attempts to maintain access to the system to steal any sensitive data or damage systems. The fifth and final stage of a pen test is the reporting phase when testers compile the test results.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003ENo Previous Knowledge is needed!\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou don\u2019t need to have previous knowledge about all. \u003Cstrong\u003EThis course will take you from a beginner to a more advanced level with hands-on examples.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003ELearn the famous hacking framework Metasploit\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe will start with the very basics.

This Microcontroller is called\u0026nbsp;DigiSpark.\u0026nbsp;It is a microcontroller\u0026nbsp;based on the Attiny85 development board. It is similar to Arduino but smaller and more powerful in terms of\u0026nbsp;hacking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstalling backdoors, exfiltrating documents, or capturing credentials is incredibly easy with a seemingly innocent USB drive called the USB\u0026nbsp; Rubber Ducky. An Expert hacker with a few minutes, photographic memory,\u0026nbsp; and perfect typing accuracy can use a few well-crafted keystrokes to hack virtually anything they have physical access to. However, the proper hardware can do the same thing every time on demand without fail.\u0026nbsp; That\u2019s where the Rubber Ducky and other Human Interface Devices (HID)\u0026nbsp; come into play. They inject keystrokes at superhuman speeds, violating computers\u0027 inherent trust in humans by posing as a keyboard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this class, we\u2019ll learn more about what HID attacks are, how they work,\u0026nbsp; the social engineering that can be involved in their deployment, and how to use them in your Pen-testing engagements. Keyboards announce themselves to computers as HID devices and are in turn automatically recognized and accepted. We\u0027ll program a microcontroller in Arduino to take advantage of this by acting as an HID device. We can then create scripts that run when the device is plugged into a target computer.

We\u0027ll go over creating more advanced loads, including tracking payloads that run in the background, as well as Rickroll payloads that can be used with permission from friends and family to demonstrate how HID attacks work. Additionally, students learn to automate nearly anything on an unattended device which can be extremely useful when you need to run the same commands on a series of computers.\u0026nbsp; That\u2019s how the Original USB Ruber Ducky was invented. Hak5 founder\u0026nbsp; Darren Kitchen, while working as a sysadmin, got tired of typing the same commands to fix printers and network shares, again and again, and the device evolved out of laziness. He programmed a development board to emulate the typing for him - and thus the keystroke injection attack was born.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0647\u0644 \u0635\u0646\u0627\u0639\u0647 \u062C\u0647\u0627\u0632 \u0631\u0627\u0628\u0631 \u062F\u0643\u064A\u061F\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u062F\u0639\u0646\u0627 \u0646\u062A\u0639\u0631\u0641 \u0639\u0644\u0649\u0026nbsp;

It assumes that you\u0027re new to the language, so it gets you started with basic functionality such as creating functions, creating variables, and calling these lines of code from your standard HTML pages. It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables.
