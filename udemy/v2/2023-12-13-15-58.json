The training program will help the trainee to perform all the statistical analysis with Minitab. It is also intended to make the trainees cover all the topics that fall under the domain of Minitab. Topics like Minitab GUI and Descriptive Statistics, Statistical Analysis using Minitab, Correlation Techniques in Minitab and Predictive Modeling using Excel will be covered in this training module and Project on Data Analytics using Minitab and Project on Minitab \u2013 Regression Modeling will be covered in the project module. The goal of this course is to help an individual to achieve knowledge of working with Minitab to perform time series analysis and forecasting of data in all sorts of statistics based problems. It will help all the interested trainees who are willing to extend their knowledge base concerned with Data analytics. This training will also assist the trainees to understand the sort of problems that could be resolved using this. After the finishing of the course, the trainee will advance with the skills needed for time series analysis and forecasting of data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo understand the meaning of the \u201Cname\u201D of the course, let us break down the curse and understand them word by word so that the intent of the course would be clear to our learners and we would set an expectation for our learners who would be pursuing the course. Let us start to understand what Minitab is. Minitab is a software used in use cases of statistics. Minitab, as the software is capable of data analysis, pattern detection through statistics, data crunching. Most of the calculation is automated, and graphs are generated as per the functionality required by the analyst working on the use cases. For this course specifically, we would be exploiting the use of Minitab for Time Series Analysis and Forecasting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, let us understand what time series analysis is. Time series data is a collection of data over some time or interval. The data when captured over time typically might have some internal structure, for example, autocorrelation, trends, seasonality, stationarity, and many such fundamentals. For example, let us think about the sales of umbrellas or raincoats. We can see that in the selling of these items we might encounter a seasonality aspect, that they might be sold high during the onset of the rainy season. Also, we can see that the data itself might auto-correlate itself to the promos that might have been set by some stores, online or offline, and many more such intricate detailing through the understanding of time series analysis fundamentals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow when we know how to analyze the time series it becomes pretty evident that what exactly to do with the studies or hypothesis we developed as a part of the study. The answer lies in prediction! We would understand the fundamentals through historical time series data and then utilize that deep insight to predict or forecast for the future. In this way, we would be able to capture the historical trends and seasonality and utilize them to have a better insight into what\u2019s in store in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis course is a collection of well-crafted tutorials or topics we would naturally go about if we must fully understand the topic of time series analysis and forecasting. This course will allow you to get a sense of what is lying in the basket of time series analysis in the professional project which you would encounter as soon as you take up the project in your organization. This course makes you reach that level of being the \u201Chandful\u201D of people who are capable of cracking even the toughest nut in the professional world.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis confidence you build in the course of this training will go a long way in not only analyzing the sense of time series data but also give you the capability to mentor people who would have just started their track on time series analysis. This course doesn\u2019t differentiate between a beginner or an advanced learner. We have to learn for everyone who is here to expand their horizon of knowledge. Lastly, we would like to mention that this course will lay a strong foundation in time series analysis so that you would be able to build a strong mansion on this foundation layer.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/predictive-modeling-and-time-series-analysis-with-minitab/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4722578_a844_3.jpg","duration":"2.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"11,754.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["We start everything from scratch and try to build from there and the only thing we require is a sense of perseverance and full dedication towards the course.

Moreover, it can be known to be the front-end based HTML framework which comprises many front end languages, and therefore it is built on top of the possibly best front end framework, AngularJS, and Cordova. It is an HTML5 based Mobile Application development framework which is targeted at building mobile-based hybrid apps. Ionic can be thought of as a front end UI framework that is used to handle the basic look and feel and the User interface based interactions that are required for the app to be compelling.

The default styling of the components can be easily overridden which can accommodate their designs. The JavaScript components extend the CSS component capabilities and also Javascript related functions and their capabilities to cover the mobile elements which cannot be only done with HTML and CSS. Other features include the ones related to Cordova plugins that offer the API related to the usage of the mobile-based native device functions with JavaScript code. The Ionic CLI is a NodeJS based utility which is powered by the various commands required for building, starting, running as well as emulating ionic applications.

CART is a predictive algorithm used in Machine learning and it explains how the target variable\u2019s values can be predicted based on other matters. It is a decision tree where each fork is split into a predictor variable and each node has a prediction for the target variable at the end. Classically, this algorithm is referred to as decision trees, but on some platforms like R they are referred to by the more modern term CART. The CART algorithm provides a foundation for important algorithms like bagged decision trees, random forest and boosted decision trees.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs the name suggests, CART (Classification and Regression Trees) can be used for both classification and regression problems. The difference lies in the target variable. That is, With classification, we attempt to predict a class label. In other words, classification is used for problems where the output (target variable) takes a finite set of values, e.g., whether it will rain tomorrow or not. Meanwhile, regression is used to predict a numerical label. This means your output can take an infinite set of values, e.g., a house price.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDecision Trees are an important type of algorithm for predictive modeling machine learning.

Here we show you why it is so important for companies, how it works in principle and how companies can implement it in practice. Investors, lenders, and managers all look to a company\u0027s financial statements using liquidity measurement ratios to evaluate liquidity risk. This is usually done by comparing liquid assets\u2014those that can easily be exchanged to create cash flow\u2014and short-term liabilities. The comparison allows you to determine if the company can make excess investments, pay out bonuses or meet their debt obligations. Companies that are over-leveraged must take steps to reduce the gap between their cash on hand and their debt obligations. When companies are over-leveraged, their liquidity risk is much higher because they have fewer assets to move around. Almost five years since the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the start of the global financial crisis, the global economy continues to feel the aftershocks. Policymakers continue to grapple with the policy response. The start of 2013 saw tail risks recede in the global economy, thanks to policy actions in the U.S. and euro area. While financial market conditions have improved markedly across the board for the last half year or so, the real economy continues to lag. We still are not seeing the levels of growth needed to drive a real global recovery, and we are not generating the jobs needed for the millions who have fallen into unemployment over the past five years.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/global-economic-crisis-liquidity-management/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5621730_1d0d.jpg","duration":"3 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"1,621.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Bankers, Accountants, People wanting to make a career in commercial Banks, Anyone who wants to learn about how risk management takes place in banks"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":7,"averageValue":"4.3"},"instructors":[{"name":"EDUCBA Bridging the Gap","url":"/user/premananda-suna/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.357143}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"EDUCBADEC12","originalPrice":"\u20B91,999","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/credit-derivatives-tutorials/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5619004,"title":"Credit Derivatives Tutorials","shortDescription":"Learn about Credit Derivatives, Types of Credit Derivatives, Pricing considerations, Regulation and Risk","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EThe course discusses about the Derivative market and understanding the forward contracts and its relationship with interest rates.

According to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, small and midsize companies suffer more losses due to fraud than their larger counterparts. Experts estimate that companies lose 5% to 6% of their annual revenue to fraud, so every company should have a comprehensive fraud prevention program. A fraud prevention program is not difficult to implement. It simply consists of education, investigation, and proactive prevention policies. Since employees are the most likely to report issues or any fraudulent activities, you certainly want to give them both the knowledge and the tools to help your company weed out any instances that may be taking place. And while fraud prevention efforts are designed to stop employee fraud, note that any investigations of suspected instances of fraud or employee theft may also act as a deterrent to other employees who may be either committing or contemplating fraud. The bulk of your company\u0027s fraud prevention efforts should be focused on the creation and implementation of proactive preventive techniques. This includes establishing internal controls and putting into place policies and procedures that are specifically designed to prevent fraud. One of the best ways to develop prevention policies may include utilizing an experienced anti-fraud professional. Make sure to find one who is experienced and has investigated numerous instances in order to help you to develop the most relevant and most effective anti-fraud controls.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/corporate-fraud-regulations-control/","imageUri":"https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5621770_4bfa.jpg","duration":"2 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"1,907.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Bankers, Accountants, Stakeholders of a company, Anyone who wants to learn about fraud control"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":5,"averageValue":"4.3"},"instructors":[{"name":"EDUCBA Bridging the Gap","url":"/user/premananda-suna/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.4}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"EDUCBADEC12","originalPrice":"\u20B91,999","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/equity-derivatives-derivatives-market-for-beginners/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5619034,"title":"Equity Derivatives \u0026 Derivatives Market for Beginners","shortDescription":"Learn about the Derivative market and understand the forward contracts, futures contracts, options, swaps etc","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EThe course discusses about the Derivative market and understanding the forward contracts, futures contracts, options, swaps.

CSR is about how corporations manage the business practices to generate an overall positive impact on the society. CSR policy would ideally function as an integrated, self-regulating mechanism whereby companies would monitor and ensure their support to ethical standards, law, and international norms. As a result, companies would accept responsibility for its activities\u2019 impact on the environment, employees, consumers, stakeholders, and communities. Additionally, CSR-focused organizations would proactively advance the public interest by promoting community growth and development, as well as voluntarily abolishing practices that harm the community. Basically, CSR is the intentional inclusion of public interest into business decision-making.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECorporate social responsibility courses include many elements, but in general, it is what companies do to help others or the environment. Many years ago companies were only interested in their profit margin and keeping their shareholders happy. These days many have come to understand that for the greatest sustainability, employees, customers, the general community and the environment are all important.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey realize that if they are seen to be polluting the environment, for instance, they will get a bad reputation that will impact on their standing in the community and perhaps even their end profits. But if they are seen to be doing something to protect the environment then the man in the street will accept and embrace them, thus creating an element that is even more important than short-term profits, viz. sustainability and popularity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is not only about the environment of Corporate Social Responsibility courses, but also taking care of people \u2013 employees or the general public, or both. After all, in many cases, it is the general public who makes or breaks a company, especially if they are selling products or providing services. If a company develops such a bad reputation for greedy profit at the expense of people, their sales will go down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo this end, there must be corporate volunteering to do the right thing because as yet there are no laws to enforce corporate social responsibility courses.

For example, if there is a rise in temperature it will also lead to a rise in the sales of ice creams. This is called positive correlation. Correlation analysis deals with relationship among variables. The correlation coefficient lets researchers to measure if there is a possible linear relationship between two variables measured on the same subject. The values of the correlation coefficient are always between -1 and \u002B1. There are different types of correlation coefficients used for different situation. The most common is the Pearson correlation coefficient.

This list contains the number of observations, mean, standard deviation, sum, minimum and maximum. One list contains each variable and their label. Finally the correlation measures are provided in the output. The output will be named \u201CPearson Correlation Coefficient\u201D by default.

By making sense of what\u0027s said and not said; what\u0027s done and not done, we can make sense of everything. We\u0027re better at receiving and processing information, and finding solutions with it. Our intrinsic sense of justice is rooted in empathy, which strengthens bonds of trust.

Zero trust architectures simplify network infrastructure, make users happier, and keep cyberthreats at a distance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince John Kindervag, then at Forrester Research, coined the phrase, zero trust architectures follow the maxim \u0022never trust, always verify.\u0022 To block inappropriate access and lateral movement throughout an environment, zero trust architecture enforces access policies based on context\u2014including the user\u0027s role and location, the device they\u0027re using, and the data they\u0027re asking for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA zero trust architecture means you know who\u0027s using what, and you can track it, including encrypted traffic; you need to monitor and verify the traffic between parts of the environment; and you need multifactor authentication (MFA) that goes beyond passwords.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn important thing to remember is that in a zero trust architecture, a resource\u0027s location isn\u0027t as important as before. Rather than rigid network segmentation, software-defined microsegmentation protects your data, workflows, services, and such anywhere, in your data center or distributed hybrid or multicloud.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy using a network-centric data security strategy that provides specific access only to those who need it, Zero Trust Architecture focuses on the business needs and functionality of an organization. By enabling parameters to dictate access and restrictions, the Zero Trust model views data security from a whole new perspective. As opposed to legacy networks that have little to no visibility or control over network and data usage, Zero Trust Architectures see all network traffic through segmentation gateways with granular policies governing access to data, apps, and assets. There are certain rules that have to be followed before a resource can be accessed in a Zero Trust network.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe five major topics I want to cover in this master\u0027s course are\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

A type of business risk, it can result from breakdowns in internal procedures, people and systems\u2014as opposed to problems incurred from external forces, such as political or economic events, or inherent to the entire market or market segment, known as systematic risk. Operational risk is the risk of losses caused by flawed or failed processes, policies, systems or events that disrupt business operations. Employee errors, criminal activity such as fraud, and physical events are among the factors that can trigger operational risk. Most organizations accept that their people and processes will inherently incur errors and contribute to ineffective operations. In evaluating operational risk, practical remedial steps should be emphasized to eliminate exposures and ensure successful responses. If left unaddressed, the incurrence of operational risk can cause monetary loss, competitive disadvantage, employee- or customer-related problems, and business failure.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/operational-risk-management-us-and-uk-markets/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5621726_8470.jpg","duration":"1.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"1,611.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Bankers, Accountants, People wanting to make a career in commercial Banks, Anyone who wants to learn about how risk management takes place in banks"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":3,"averageValue":"4.8"},"instructors":[{"name":"EDUCBA Bridging the Gap","url":"/user/premananda-suna/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.8333335}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"EDUCBADEC12","originalPrice":"\u20B91,999","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/first-90-days-as-a-new-sales-rep-sales-skills-sales-jobs/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5322130,"title":"Master Course : First 90 Days as a New Sales Rep 3.0","shortDescription":"Sales rep, New Sales representative job, Sales skills, Sales Ideas, Sales training, Sales manager job, Marketing skills","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EMaster Course: First 90 Days as a New Sales Rep\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can\u0027t expect a sales rep to know everything about your business, even if they\u0027re an effective sales player.

It provides us with mathematical tools to update our beliefs about random events in light of seeing new data or evidence about those events. Bayesian statistics is an approach to data analysis based on Bayes\u2019 theorem, where available knowledge about parameters in a statistical model is updated with the information in observed data. The background knowledge is expressed as a prior distribution and combined with observational data in the form of a likelihood function to determine the posterior distribution. The posterior can also be used for making predictions about future events. In particular Bayesian inference interprets probability as a measure of believability or confidence that an individual may possess about the occurance of a particular event.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMachine learning is a scientific discipline that explores the construction and study of algorithms that can learn from data.

In this course, we have ensured to cover all such concepts that we want our trainees to become expert in so that they can work effectively with Pyside. At the beginning of this PySide training, the trainees will get to learn about how PySide helps in solving the business problems and will also learn how to determine if the solution could be drafted using it. Later in the course, they will be covering the advanced level concepts which will help them to dive deep into the core concepts that are used when there is an urge to bring some complex level functionalities in the application. We have also added two projects in this course where the project\u2019s topics have been decided in a way so that it covers all the topics that they would have walked through in this course.

An IPO allows a company to raise equity capital from public investors. The transition from a private to a public company can be an important time for private investors to fully realize gains from their investment as it typically includes a share premium for current private investors. Meanwhile, it also allows public investors to participate in the offering.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first step in the IPO process is for the issuing company to choose an investment bank to advise the company on its IPO and to provide underwriting services. Underwriting is the process through which an investment bank (the underwriter) acts as a broker between the issuing company and the investing public to help the issuing company sell its initial set of shares. After the IPO is approved by the SEC, the effective date is decided. On the day before the effective date, the issuing company and the underwriter decide the offer price (i.e., the price at which the shares will be sold by the issuing company) and the precise number of shares to be sold. Deciding the offer price is important because it is the price at which the issuing company raises capital for itself. After the issue has been brought to the market, the underwriter has to provide analyst recommendations, after-market stabilization, and create a market for the stock issued.
