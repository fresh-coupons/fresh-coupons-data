It assumes that you\u0027re new to the language, so it gets you started with basic functionality such as creating functions, creating variables, and calling these lines of code from your standard HTML pages. It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E*\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E javascript course contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript introduction\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript array\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript variables\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript functions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript objects\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript control statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003Esection 4- learn PHP\u0026nbsp;programming language\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis section will learn the basic structure of a web application and how a web browser interacts with a web server.

It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat are the steps I should follow to be able to build a Machine Learning model?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can divide your learning process into 3 parts:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStatistics and Probability - Implementing Machine learning techniques require basic knowledge of Statistics and probability concepts. Second section of the course covers this part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnderstanding of Machine learning - Fourth section helps you understand the terms and concepts associated with Machine learning and gives you the steps to be followed to build a machine learning model\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProgramming Experience - A significant part of machine learning is programming. Python and R clearly stand out to be the leaders in the recent days. Third section will help you set up the Python environment and teach you some basic operations. In later sections there is a video on how to implement each concept taught in theory lecture in Python\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnderstanding of\u0026nbsp; models - Fifth and sixth section cover Classification models and with each theory lecture comes a corresponding practical lecture where we actually run each query with you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy use R for Machine Learning?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnderstanding R is one of the valuable skills needed for a career in Machine Learning. Below are some reasons why you should learn Machine learning in R\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\t1. It\u2019s a popular language for Machine Learning at top tech firms. Almost all of them hire data scientists who use R. Facebook, for example, uses R to do behavioral analysis with user post data. Google uses R to assess ad effectiveness and make economic forecasts. And by the way, it\u2019s not just tech firms: R is in use at analysis and consulting firms, banks and other financial institutions, academic institutions and research labs, and pretty much everywhere else data needs analyzing and visualizing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\t2. Learning the data science basics is arguably easier in R. R has a big advantage: it was designed specifically with data manipulation and analysis in mind. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\t3. Amazing packages that make your life easier. Because R was designed with statistical analysis in mind, it has a fantastic ecosystem of packages and other resources that are great for data science. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\t4. Robust, growing community of data scientists and statisticians. As the field of data science has exploded, R has exploded with it, becoming one of the fastest-growing languages in the world (as measured by StackOverflow). That means it\u2019s easy to find answers to questions and community guidance as you work your way through projects in R.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\t5. Put another tool in your toolkit. No one language is going to be the right tool for every job. Adding R to your repertoire will make some projects easier \u2013 and of course, it\u2019ll also make you a more flexible and marketable employee when you\u2019re looking for jobs in data science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat is the difference between Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPut simply, machine learning and data mining use the same algorithms and techniques as data mining, except the kinds of predictions vary. While data mining discovers previously unknown patterns and knowledge, machine learning reproduces known patterns and knowledge\u2014and further automatically applies that information to data, decision-making, and actions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDeep learning, on the other hand, uses advanced computing power and special types of neural networks and applies them to large amounts of data to learn, understand, and identify complicated patterns.

More specifically, that y can be calculated from a linear combination of the input variables (x).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen there is a single input variable (x), the method is referred to as simple linear regression.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen there are multiple input variables, the method is known as multiple linear regression.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy learn Linear regression technique of Machine learning?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are four reasons to learn Linear regression technique of Machine learning:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Linear Regression is the most popular machine learning technique\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Linear Regression has fairly good prediction accuracy\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.

It gives you a firm base to start learning other advanced techniques of Machine Learning\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHow much time does it take to learn Linear regression technique of machine learning?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELinear Regression is easy but no one can determine the learning time it takes. It totally depends on you. The method we adopted to help you learn Linear regression starts from the basics and takes you to advanced level within hours. You can follow the same, but remember you can learn nothing without practicing it. Practice is the only way to remember whatever you have learnt. Therefore, we have also provided you with another data set to work on as a separate project of Linear regression.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat are the steps I should follow to be able to build a Machine Learning model?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can divide your learning process into 4 parts:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStatistics and Probability - Implementing Machine learning techniques require basic knowledge of Statistics and probability concepts.
