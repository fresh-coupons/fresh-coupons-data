To run a business at optimal capacity, you need to reduce or eliminate waste from processes and improve production flow. In this course, you\u0027ll learn about Lean strategies to reduce waste by determining which operations add value and which don\u0027t. You\u0027ll explore the concept of continuous flow, and discover how to balance work processes to make production flow more efficient. You\u0027ll define what waste is, where it exists, and what causes it.

And in any business, one of the heaviest drains on profitability is waste. Lean waste can come in the form of time, material, and labor. But it may also be related to the utilization of skill-sets as well as poor planning. In lean manufacturing, waste is any expense or effort that is expended but which does not transform raw materials into an item the customer is willing to pay for. By optimizing process steps and eliminating waste, the only true value is added at each phase of production.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday, the Lean Manufacturing model recognizes 8 types of waste within an operation; seven originally conceived when the Toyota Production System was first conceived, and an eighth added when the lean methodology was adopted within the Western World.

Do you know why? Well, language is a skill and not information. The only way you can develop a skill is by practicing and in this case that means repetition. You can be presented with information in form of grammar or explanations of sentence patterns and you can learn it, but that\u00A0 is only awareness, now you can recognize phrases or pattern or word sequences, but you cannot produce. The only way to develop your conversational skills is overlearning, i.e., repeating patterns until they are embedded into your subconscious mind.\u00A0 Repetition is the key to become fluent in a second language and that is what this course is about: to make you a fluent Spanish speaker\u00A0 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00A0 \t\u00A0 We keep the grammar at the lowest level and focus on over-learning.

A native doesn\u2019t need to think about what they need to say, they think about how to achieve their communication goals and they don\u2019t need to think about which words to use, that is subconscious.

Most of the functions and applications that make the Internet indispensable to modern life are coded in some form of JavaScript.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe earliest incarnations of JavaScript were developed in the late 1990s for the Netscape Navigator Web browser. At the time, Web pages were static, offering little user interaction beyond clicking links and \u003Cstrong\u003Eloading new pages\u003C/strong\u003E. For the first time, JavaScript enabled animation, adaptive content and form validation on the page.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor many years, JavaScript only functioned on a limited number of browsers. Microsoft\u0027s Internet Explorer, the largest browser base, did not support JavaScript until much later. Instead, Microsoft created its own proprietary client-side script called JScript. In the early days of \u003Cstrong\u003EWeb development\u003C/strong\u003E, programmers who wished to create dynamic websites were often forced to choose one browser family over the other. This was less than ideal because it made the Internet less universally accessible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJavaScript did not become standardized and widely adopted until 1999.

Most Web applications, \u003Cstrong\u003Esuch as a search engine\u003C/strong\u003E, work because of an interaction between the user\u0027s device (e.g. computer, \u003Cstrong\u003Ephone or tablet\u003C/strong\u003E) and a remote server. The software on the remote server sends information to the client (i.e. the user\u0027s machine) and the software on the client side reads the information and renders a Web page on screen.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EA client-side script is a programming language that performs its tasks entirely on the client\u0027s machine and does not need to interact with the server to function. For instance, if you have a Web page loaded on your computer and your Internet service provider goes down, you are still able to interact with the Web pages already loaded on your browser.

It takes an iterable (such as an array) and repeats a portion of HTML code for each item in the collection. Within the ngFor loop, you can access properties and methods of the current item using a local variable. The ngFor directive is commonly used to display lists, tables, or any other repeating elements in Angular templates. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn more: [learn more url here]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAngular Sample Question 2:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat is an observable in Angular and how is it used?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOption 1: An observable in Angular is a mechanism used to manage server-side logic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOption 2: An observable in Angular is a class used to style HTML elements.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOption 3: An observable in Angular is a component used to handle user events.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOption 4: An observable in Angular is an asynchronous data stream that can be observed and processed using operators.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECorrect Answer: \u003C/strong\u003EOption 4\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EExplanation:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn Angular, an observable is a powerful data handling mechanism based on the Reactive Programming paradigm. It represents an asynchronous data stream that can emit multiple values over time. Observables are used extensively in Angular for handling asynchronous operations such as making HTTP requests, handling user events, or managing data streams. Observables can be combined, transformed, filtered, and subscribed to using operators, allowing for efficient data manipulation and handling. They provide a convenient way to handle asynchronous operations, manage data streams, and react to changes in the application. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn more: [learn more url here]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAnd don\u0027t worry, if you have any questions along the way, we are here to help!
