This is a comprehensive project-based course where you will learn step by step on how to perform complex analysis and visualization on infectious diseases datasets. This course is a perfect combination between biostatistics and Python, equipping you with the tools and techniques to tackle real-world challenges in public health. The course will be mainly concentrating on three major aspects, the first one is data analysis where you will explore the infectious diseases data from multiple perspectives, the second one is time series forecasting where you will be guided step by step on how to forecast the spread of infectious diseases using STL model, and the third one is public health policy where you will learn how to make a data driven public health policy based on epidemiological modeling. In the introduction session, you will learn the basic fundamentals of biostatistics, such as getting to know more about challenges that we commonly face when analyzing biostatistics data and statistical models that we will use, for instance STL which stands for seasonal trend decomposition. Then, you will continue by learning how to calculate infectious disease transmission using Kermack-McKendrick equation, this is a very important concept that you need to understand before getting into the coding session. Afterward, you will also learn several factors that can potentially accelerate the spread of infectious diseases, such as population density, healthcare accessibility, and antigenic variation. Once you have learnt all necessary information about biostatistics, we will start the project. Firstly, you will be guided step by step on how to set up Google Colab IDE. Not only that, you will also learn how to find and download infectious diseases dataset from Kaggle. Once, everything is ready, we will enter the main section of the course which is the project section The project will be consisted of three main parts, the first part is to conduct exploratory data analysis, the second part is to build forecasting model to predict the spread of the diseases in the future using time series model, meanwhile the third part is to perform epidemiological modelling and use the result to develop a public health policy to slow down the spread of the infectious disease.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, before getting into the course, we need to ask this question to ourselves: why should we learn biostatistics, particularly infectious diseases analysis? Well, there are many reasons why, firstly, if you are interested in working in the public health or healthcare industry, having biostatistics knowledge would be very beneficial and help you to level up your career. In addition to that, you will also learn a lot of valuable skill sets that can be implemented in other projects, for example, time series decomposition can be used to forecast stock, real estate, commodity, and cryptocurrency markets. Last but not least, this course will also train you to be a better public health policy maker as you will extensively learn how to make data driven decisions and take other external factors into consideration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow are things that you can expect to learn from this course:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn the basic fundamentals of biostatistics and infectious disease analysis\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to calculate infectious disease transmission rate using SIR model\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn several factors that accelerate the spread of infectious disease, such as population density, herd immunity, and antigenic variation\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to find and download datasets from Kaggle\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to clean dataset by removing missing rows and duplicate values\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to detect potential outliers using Z score method\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to find correlation between population and disease rate\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to analyze infected patient demographics\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to map infectious disease per county using heatmap\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to analyze infectious disease yearly trend\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to perform confidence interval analysis\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to forecast infectious disease rate using time series decomposition model\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to do epidemiological modeling using SIR model\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to perform public health policy evaluation\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-biostatistics-analyzing-infectious-diseases-data/","imageUri":"https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5623864_3824.jpg","duration":"3 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"2,189.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["People who are interested in learning biostatistics","People who are interested in analysing infectious disease dataset"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":0,"averageValue":"0.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"Christ Raharja","url":"/user/christ-raharja/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":0}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"1C8D58BB027BA58786FE","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"3 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/mastering-the-fundamentals-of-chatgpt-and-ai-tools/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5538416,"title":"Mastering the Fundamentals of ChatGPT and AI Tools","shortDescription":"Unlocking Your Ultimate Edge: ChatGPT - Empowering Productivity, Passive Earnings, and Personal Advancement","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the ChatGPT Mastery Program, your ultimate resource for harnessing the full potential of the powerful AI language model, ChatGPT.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThroughout this comprehensive course, you will acquire the skills to fine-tune ChatGPT, enabling it to generate text that closely mimics human language.

It\u0027s a diverse group of caregivers - they provide care in a bunch of different situations. Taking a step back, let\u0027s ask ourselves, \u201Cwhat is a caregiver?

Zero trust architectures simplify network infrastructure, make users happier, and keep cyberthreats at a distance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince John Kindervag, then at Forrester Research, coined the phrase, zero trust architectures follow the maxim \u0022never trust, always verify.\u0022 To block inappropriate access and lateral movement throughout an environment, zero trust architecture enforces access policies based on context\u2014including the user\u0027s role and location, the device they\u0027re using, and the data they\u0027re asking for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA zero trust architecture means you know who\u0027s using what, and you can track it, including encrypted traffic; you need to monitor and verify the traffic between parts of the environment; and you need multifactor authentication (MFA) that goes beyond passwords.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn important thing to remember is that in a zero trust architecture, a resource\u0027s location isn\u0027t as important as before. Rather than rigid network segmentation, software-defined microsegmentation protects your data, workflows, services, and such anywhere, in your data center or distributed hybrid or multicloud.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy using a network-centric data security strategy that provides specific access only to those who need it, Zero Trust Architecture focuses on the business needs and functionality of an organization. By enabling parameters to dictate access and restrictions, the Zero Trust model views data security from a whole new perspective. As opposed to legacy networks that have little to no visibility or control over network and data usage, Zero Trust Architectures see all network traffic through segmentation gateways with granular policies governing access to data, apps, and assets. There are certain rules that have to be followed before a resource can be accessed in a Zero Trust network.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe five major topics I want to cover in this master\u0027s course are\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

The goal is for the model to learn a mapping function that can predict the output for unseen inputs accurately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eb) Unsupervised Learning: Unlike supervised learning, unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data. The algorithm\u0027s objective is to find patterns and structures in the data without explicit guidance. Clustering and dimensionality reduction are typical tasks in unsupervised learning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ec) Reinforcement Learning: This type of learning is inspired by behavioral psychology, where an agent interacts with an environment and learns to take actions that maximize rewards or minimize penalties.

The data should be representative of the problem you want to solve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eb) Data Preprocessing: This step involves cleaning the data, handling missing values, and transforming the data into a suitable format for training the models.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ec) Feature Engineering: Selecting and creating relevant features from the data is an essential part of building effective machine learning models. Good features can significantly impact the model\u0027s performance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ed) Model Selection: Choosing an appropriate algorithm or model architecture for the task at hand is essential. The choice of model depends on the problem type (classification, regression, etc.) and the nature of the data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ee) Model Training: In this step, the model is exposed to the training data to learn the underlying patterns and relationships. The algorithm adjusts its parameters to minimize the prediction errors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ef) Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model\u0027s performance on a separate set of data (validation or test set) is essential to ensure it generalizes well to unseen data and avoids overfitting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eg) Model Deployment: After a successful evaluation, the model can be deployed in a real-world setting to make predictions or decisions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEvaluation Metrics\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo assess the performance of a machine learning model, various evaluation metrics are used, depending on the type of problem. For classification tasks, metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are commonly used. For regression tasks, mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) are popular metrics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you continue your journey into the world of machine learning, remember that practice is crucial.
