There are two types of chemical bonds: 1. primary chemical bonds e.g covalent bonds, in which atoms share one or more electron(s); ionic bonds, in which an atom donates one or more electrons to another atom to produce ions (cations and anions); metallic bonds and 2. secondary chemical bonds e.g. hydrogen bonds; Van der Waals force bonds, ion-ion interaction, ion-dipole interaction etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"Ingl\u00E9s","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/school-chemistry-class-11-practical-tests-and-answers/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4564488_07ec.jpg","duration":"381 questions","enrolledStudentsCount":"137 estudiantes","lastUpdated":"Publicado el 2/2022","targetAudiences":["Chemistry Lovers","School Students","Teachers","Fathers and mothers / Parents","Kids"],"tags":["Ense\u00F1anzas y disciplinas acad\u00E9micas","Ciencia"],"rating":null,"instructors":[{"name":"SMARTER ACADEMY","url":"/user/haytham-hesham-elsayed-hashem-elmousalami/","totalNumberOfStudents":180946,"totalNumberOfReviews":2208,"averageRating":4.216980643944637}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"8C6A4F4EBB7988CFE236","originalPrice":"12.800\u00A0INR","discountedPrice":"Gratis","expirationText":"4 d\u00EDas","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/windows-10-administration-basic-troubleshooting/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":3035410,"title":"Windows 10 System Administration \u0026 Basic Computer Skills","shortDescription":"Learn the basics of system administration for the Windows 10 operating system, as well as some basic computer skills","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EThis course covers Windows 10 Administration as well as some basic computer skills surrounding the Windows 10 operating system, as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*\u0026nbsp;Logging into your machine, switching users, and signing out\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Finding your way around File Explorer and pinning commonly used items to the Start Menu and\u0026nbsp;Taskbar\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Setting a default printer, screen size and screen resolution\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*\u0026nbsp;Overview of Accessibility Options available within\u0026nbsp;Windows 10\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* CTRL\u002BALT\u002BDEL\u0026nbsp;menu options, including\u0026nbsp;Task Manager and locking your machine\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe course is intended as a basic overview for anyone using Windows 10 for the first time, for example if your company has recently upgraded to Windows 10 from a previous operating system, such as Windows 7.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"Ingl\u00E9s","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/windows-10-administration-basic-troubleshooting/","imageUri":"https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/3035410_67d4_5.jpg?secure=KUJXaxo9gjQtak6Z7-5frQ%3D%3D%2C1646188763","duration":"30 total mins","enrolledStudentsCount":"25.322 estudiantes","lastUpdated":"Fecha de la \u00FAltima actualizaci\u00F3n: 5/2020","targetAudiences":["Anyone using Windows 10 for the first time in a corporate environment"],"tags":["Inform\u00E1tica y software","Sistemas operativos y servidores","Windows 10"],"rating":{"count":354,"averageValue":"4.3"},"instructors":[{"name":"John Courtenay","url":"/user/john-courtenay-2/","totalNumberOfStudents":248433,"totalNumberOfReviews":7474,"averageRating":4.099271389908257}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"EFEB2022X","originalPrice":"1.280\u00A0INR","discountedPrice":"Gratis","expirationText":"4 d\u00EDas","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/secrets-of-memory-3-ways-of-memorising-like-a-spy/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4140852,"title":"Memory: 3 Ways of Memorising Like a Spy","shortDescription":"Let\u2019s jog your Memory and make it even better that it was before!","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EOur brain is really stubborn at times.

Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. The timestamp proves that the transaction data existed when the block was published in order to get into its hash. As blocks each contain information about the block previous to it, they form a chain, with each additional block reinforcing the ones before it. Therefore, blockchains are resistant to modification of their data because once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBlockchains are typically managed by a peer-to-peer network for use as a publicly distributed ledger, where nodes collectively adhere to a protocol to communicate and validate new blocks.

You will get acquainted with technical and fundamental analysis and you will use different tools for your analysis. You will get acquainted with technical and fundamental analysis and you will use different tools for your analysis. You will learn the Python environment completely. You will also learn deep learning algorithms and artificial neural networks that can greatly enhance your financial analysis skills and expertise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis tutorial begins by exploring various ways of downloading financial data and preparing it for modeling. We check the basic statistical properties of asset prices and returns, and investigate the existence of so-called stylized facts. We then calculate popular indicators used in technical analysis (such as Bollinger Bands, Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), and Relative Strength Index (RSI)) and backtest automatic trading strategies built on their basis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next section introduces time series analysis and explores popular models such as exponential smoothing, AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), and Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) (including multivariate specifications). We also introduce you to factor models, including the famous Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and the Fama-French three-factor model. We end this section by demonstrating different ways to optimize asset allocation, and we use Monte Carlo simulations for tasks such as calculating the price of American options or estimating the Value at Risk (VaR).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the last part of the course, we carry out an entire data science project in the financial domain. We approach credit card fraud/default problems using advanced classifiers such as random forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, stacked models, and many more. We also tune the hyperparameters of the models (including Bayesian optimization) and handle class imbalance. We conclude the book by demonstrating how deep learning (using PyTorch) can solve numerous financial problems.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"Englisch","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/python-and-machine-learning-in-financial-analysis/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4248756_2478.jpg","duration":"20.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"30.957 Teilnehmer","lastUpdated":"Zuletzt aktualisiert: 9/2021","targetAudiences":["Developers","Financial Analysts","Data Analysts","Data Scientists","Stock and cryptocurrency traders","Students","Teachers","Researchers"],"tags":["Programmierung","Data Science","Python"],"rating":{"count":138,"averageValue":"4.4"},"instructors":[{"name":"S.Emadedin Hashemi","url":"/user/emha-4/","totalNumberOfStudents":30957,"totalNumberOfReviews":138,"averageRating":4.429683}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"EBC4576FE47BAF39A763","originalPrice":"6.720\u00A0\u20B9","discountedPrice":"4.368\u00A0\u20B9","expirationText":"5 Stunden","discountPercentage":35}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/python-exam-98-381-pcap-pcep/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":2606664,"title":"Python Certification Exam Microsoft MTA 98-381 - Preparation","shortDescription":"Get certified for Python in 2022!

The syntax is simple and the code is very readable. With Python, you can write programs in fewer lines of code than with most other programming languages. The popularity of Python is growing rapidly. It is now one of the most popular programming languages. Python has a wide variety of applications. It is used for automation, web application development, artificial intelligence, data science and so on:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAutomation\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPython can make life easier by automating many tasks, such as scraping a website to collect data, automating test cases in software development, or automating everyday office tasks. Python can easily access and read all kinds of files, which opens up the possibility of saving a lot of time by automating repetitive tasks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWeb Development\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPython is a good choice for rapid web application development. With many frameworks like Django, Pyramid, and Flask, you can develop web applications with great speed using Python. Python is used on the server side of web development. You can use Python to interact with database and create RESTful API services.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EArtificial Intelligence\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe near future will be the era of artificial intelligence. In the past, computers and machines were used to perform mathematical calculations at very high speeds, but now many large organizations and researchers are working to develop intelligent systems that can perform tasks like a human. To some extent, machines are able to understand human emotions and their natural language. They can mimic certain human actions that were not possible before. Again, Python is very popular for developing AI systems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EData Science\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEarlier, Python was mainly used to build applications and write scripts to automate tasks, but now a brand new trend of data science has given Python an even bigger boost. Data scientists are heavily dependent on Python because it is so simple, has a large community, and can perform huge calculations with ease.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EPython is being used in a wide variety of fields, and there are no signs that this trend is coming to a halt.
