It assumes that you\u0027re new to the language, so it gets you started with basic functionality such as creating functions, creating variables, and calling these lines of code from your standard HTML pages. It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E*\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E javascript course contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript introduction\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript array\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript variables\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript functions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript objects\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript control statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript cookies\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript loop statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript data structures\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript error handling\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript regular expressions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003Esection 2- learn PHP\u0026nbsp;programming language\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis section will learn the basic structure of a web application and how a web browser interacts with a web server.

The LiveView programming model is mostly declarative: instead of saying \u0022when event ABC happens, change XYZ on the page\u0022, events in LiveView are managed by handlers bound to event id. Once the state changes, LiveView will re-render the relevant parts of its HTML template(calculate diff) and push it to the browser, which updates itself most efficiently.

A method many use to address this fear is to create presentation slides as a memory aid. However, this can be short-sighted because nothing erodes your credibility as a speaker faster than signaling to the audience that you depend on your slides.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeasoned presenters are able to announce a slide before showing it. At a minimum, they know their material so well that they only need to briefly glance at the slide to know what\u0027s coming next. You can achieve this by doing simple memory-boosting practices to remember your presentation material and, in turn, reduce your anxiety.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emong the most effective tips for memorizing lines is The Palace Method or Mind Palace. The Palace Method is based on research into brain science that has proven a very deep connection between how we remember an event and the space in which it occurred. The brain system important for memory is lso important for space; in other words, we remember things based on spatial locations or \u0022spatial scaffolds.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn a nutshell, The Palace Method is a memory technique that involves transforming what you want to remember into images and placing the images in a familiar mental location. In other words, you\u0027re giving your memories something to hang on to, a spatial anchor. You can then mentally tour your Memory Palace looking at your memories through these spatial anchors to help you recall each memory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are ready enroll now\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/33-memory-techniques-to-remember-anything/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5446692_2404_2.jpg","duration":"34 total mins","enrolledStudentsCount":"1,961.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Everyone who want to improve this skill"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":6,"averageValue":"4.4"},"instructors":[{"name":"ELOUAZZANI HAMZA","url":"/user/hamza-elouazzani/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"753F3F8BEB25E679BE63","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/mastering-logical-fallacies-how-to-think-react-positivly/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5442204,"title":"Mastering Logical Fallacies: How to Think \u0026 React positivly","shortDescription":"Mastering Logical Fallacies How to Think Critically and Avoid Common Errors","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EMy name is Hamza ELOUAZZANI, I am a Logistics Specialist \u0026amp; Analyst, with a Master\u0027s degree in Logistics Management.

You call a meeting to try to convince your boss and peers that your company needs to make an important move\u2014for instance, funding a risky but promising venture. Your argument is impassioned, your logic unassailable, your data bulletproof. Two weeks later, though, you learn that your brilliant proposal has been tabled. What went wrong?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll too often, people make the mistake of focusing too much on the content of their argument and not enough on how they deliver that message. Indeed, far too many decisions go the wrong way because information is presented ineffectively. In our experience, people can vastly improve their chances of having their proposals succeed by determining who the chief decision maker is among the executives they are trying to persuade and then tailoring their arguments to that business leader\u2019s decision-making style.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpecifically, we have found that executives typically fall into one of five decision-making categories: Charismatics can be initially exuberant about a new idea or proposal but will yield a final decision based on a balanced set of information. Thinkers can exhibit contradictory points of view within a single meeting and need to cautiously work through all the options before coming to a decision. Skeptics remain highly suspicious of data that don\u2019t fit with their worldview and make decisions based on their gut feelings. Followers make decisions based on how other trusted executives, or they themselves, have made similar decisions in the past. And controllers focus on the pure facts and analytics of a decision because of their own fears and uncertainties.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe five styles span a wide range of behaviors and characteristics. Controllers, for instance, have a strong aversion to risk; charismatics tend to seek it out. Despite such differences, people frequently use a one-size-fits-all approach when trying to convince their bosses, peers, and staff. They argue their case to a thinker the same way they would to a skeptic.

It varies from person to person, but let\u0027s just say you probably won\u0027t master these in your first few months.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdvanced SEO typically involves technical concepts that are somewhat advanced, and/or a deeper understanding of the workings of Google\u0027s algorithm and are often employed by Professional SEOs. Anyone can master advanced concepts with the right strategic guidance and real life application.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAccording to Griffin, Search engine optimization is the science of improving a website to increase its visibility when people search for products or services. The more visibility a website has on search engines, the more likely it is that brand captures business.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWebsite visibility is commonly measured by the placement -- or ranking -- of the site on search engine results pages (SERPs). And companies always vie for the first page, where they are most likely to garner the most attention.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing Google as an example, SERPs often feature ads at the top of the page. These are positions that businesses are willing to pay for to ensure placement on that first page. Following ads are the regular search listings, which marketers and search engines refer to as organic search results. The SEO process aims to increase a business\u0027s organic search results, driving organic search traffic to the site. This enables data marketers to distinguish between traffic that comes to a website from other channels -- such as paid search, social media, referrals and direct -- and the organic search traffic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrganic search traffic is usually higher-quality traffic because users are actively searching for a specific topic, product or service for which a site might rank. If a user finds that site through the search engine, it can lead to better brand engagement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow does SEO work? While there is a way to maximize results, it is almost impossible to fully manipulate search algorithms. Businesses often look to the shortest path toward ideal results with the least amount of effort, but SEO requires a lot of action and time. There is no SEO strategy where something can be changed today with the expectation of clear results tomorrow. SEO is a long-term project, with daily action and constant activity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch engines use bots to crawl all website pages, downloading and storing that information into a collection known as an index. This index is like a library and when someone searches for something in it, the search engine acts as the librarian. The search engine pulls and displays relevant information from the search query and shows users content related to what they were looking for. Search engine algorithms analyze webpages in the index to determine the order those pages should be displayed on the SERP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe learning objectives of SEO (Search Engine Optimization) encompass various skills and knowledge that enable individuals to effectively optimize websites and content for search engines.

It is implemented through a system called jails, as well as a userland utility plus, depending on the system, a number of other utilities. The functionality was committed into FreeBSD in 1999 by Poul-Henning Kamp after some period of production use by a hosting provider and was first released with FreeBSD 4.0, thus being supported on a number of FreeBSD descendants, including DragonFly BSD, to this day.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe need for the FreeBSD jails came from a small shared-environment hosting provider\u0027s (R\u0026amp;D Associates, Inc.\u0027s owner, Derrick T. Woolworth) desire to establish a clean, clear-cut separation between their own services and those of their customers, mainly for security and ease of administration (jail(8)). Instead of adding a new layer of fine-grained configuration options, the solution adopted by Poul-Henning Kamp was to compartmentalize the system \u2013 both its files and its resources \u2013 in such a way that only the right people are given access to the right compartments.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETopics covered in this course:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u0027Mastering Jails\u0027 course covers most of the Jails setup options available and required for running Jails in real live scenarios.

Circularity reduces both our demand for raw materials and the environmental impact of obtaining them. Why circular economy is the future? Reduced Waste; By implementing circular economy models, we can significantly reduce the amount of waste being produced and increase economic growth by creating new industries around better managing the waste being produced.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECircularity also promises to deliver substantial economic benefits. Scaling up reuse, repair, remanufacturing, and recycling creates millions of jobs and stimulates innovation.

I started out my sales career in car sales. I loved it except I was only there to gain sales experience and I had to always be there to make a sale. I treated my car sales job as my college years. I was there 3 years, 10 months before I discovered brokering money. I sell other people\u2019s money to small business owners. I sell the sexiest product in the world. The one thing that 90% of the world is chasing, I am selling. It\u2019s perfect and you can do it from anywhere in the world. This isn\u2019t a get rich quick scheme so if you are looking for one, you\u2019ve picked up the wrong course. You will have to work, but you can easily make 7-6 figures doing this. I am going to help you avoid some of my mistakes and get to where you want to be quicker. Like I said in the beginning, I was a car salesman. I got burned out and had a young daughter and I have always known that I just wanted to learn how to sell then do my own thing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHow do you Broker Money? \u003C/strong\u003EBasically, You are an Independent sales Organization or ISO for short. Your job is to find small business owners who need money for their business, the business can be a start-up, the business can be in different industries. I would advise you to pick a niche. (More on that later) Once you find people who are in need of money you then connect them to our friends (direct lenders) who have money for sale. You make money in the middle. Your don\u2019t have to put up any of your own money to fund businesses. There\u2019s limited risk to you. Our job is to simply find people who need money for business purposes. As long as you can help people solve their money problems, you will never have money problems of your own. You can make money as soon as the Day after you get started. In this industry we can get businesses funding within 24 hours and we get paid from the direct lenders after the business is funded. In this course, you will learn how to find deals, how to sell and have the opportunity to work with me directly. \u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/business-loan-broker-product-knowledge-sales-marketing/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5462204_f50f.jpg","duration":"2 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"2,653.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["This course is for people who are looking for a career change or an opportunity to work for themselves from home.","Real estate professionals and Mortgage lenders do well in our industry","This course is great for people who are in car sales and are trying to get into a new industry","This course is for business bankers that want to work for themselves and provide loans for businesses"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":13,"averageValue":"4.5"},"instructors":[{"name":"Amir Towns","url":"/user/amir-towns-2/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.5384617}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"F1D02EA8516F136AA4D9","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"2 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/drupal-masterclass/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":1894054,"title":"Drupal For Absolute Beginners (2023)","shortDescription":"The Most Comprehensive Course To Start Learning Latest And Greatest Drupal From Scratch","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThis is The BEST Course To Start Learning the Latest And Greatest Drupal From Scratch.

I have always been a firm believer in learning by doing and in this course, you will learn what you need to know by hands-on experience. You don\u2019t need any special knowledge except basic computer skills to get started with the course. Every one of you comes from a different background and hence the course is crafted from basic to advanced level with minute details in every lecture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe course is divided into 8 sections. In the first section, you will learn in detail about the Asus tinker board and how it is different from its competitor Raspberry Pi.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the second section, we will understand how to burn the OS image to the SD card and use the tinker board as a full-fledged PC. Once we are done with this we will go ahead and understand the IP scanner tool and then use the putty application to access the Linux terminal of the Asus tinker board.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStarting on a Tinker board is not always easy because you don\u2019t necessarily have the habit of using command lines. However, they are essentials and often faster or more efficient than going through the GUI. So in the third section, we will get to know about all the day to day usage Linux commands with practical examples.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fourth section begins with remotely accessing the graphical user interface of the tinker board and understanding the basic GUI applications. Once we are done with this we will go ahead and understand the general-purpose input-output functionality.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the fifth section, we will step into the world of physical computing. We will begin with a basic project where we will learn to program different LEDs and a buzzer. This will help us to understand the GPIO pin structure and how to use them for programming.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe sixth section exposes you to the intermediate level of project development. Here, you will learn to build automatic garden lights. This project will solve your day to day problems of manually turning the light ON in the evening and then turning it off again in the morning. You will learn to program and automate things as per your requirements.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the seventh section, we will go ahead with the advanced project where we will learn to build our own home automation project. We will first understand about the IoT and how it is implemented in real-time. You will learn to control your home appliances from anywhere. For example, If you are in the US, you will be able to turn off your lights from the UK.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, in the eight section, you will come to know how to transfer files remotely from PC to Tinker Board. You will also go through what you have learned so far in the entire course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease note that the project covered in the course will work on any version of the Tinker Board.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAll the lectures contain English subtitles for clear and better understanding. If you face any technical issues, please post your query in the question and answer section and I will get back to you within 1 business day.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the end of the course, you will have a solid foundation on tinker board, relay and sensor usage, IoT dashboard implementation, etc. So apart from building this project, you will also find it easy to build any other project of your choice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank You\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/getting-stared-with-asus-tinker-board/","imageUri":"https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/3503994_2632_7.jpg","duration":"2 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"12,070.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["For beginners who wants to explore the latest Tinker Board","Who wants to build real-time projects to solve day to day problems"],"tags":["Internet Of Things"],"rating":{"count":30,"averageValue":"4.7"},"instructors":[{"name":"Comfiny .","url":"/user/comfiny/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.75},{"name":"Technical Support Team","url":"/user/comfiny-support-team/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.75}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"IOT_PROJECT","originalPrice":"\u20B91,999","discountedPrice":"\u20B9449","expirationText":"5 hours","discountPercentage":78}}},"freeCourses":{}}
