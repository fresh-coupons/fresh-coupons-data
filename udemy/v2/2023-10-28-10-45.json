At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E*\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E javascript course contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript introduction\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript array\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript variables\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript functions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript objects\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript control statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript cookies\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript loop statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript data structures\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript error handling\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript regular expressions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003Esection 3- learn PHP\u0026nbsp;programming language\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis section will learn the basic structure of a web application and how a web browser interacts with a web server.

Here we show you why it is so important for companies, how it works in principle and how companies can implement it in practice. Investors, lenders, and managers all look to a company\u0027s financial statements using liquidity measurement ratios to evaluate liquidity risk. This is usually done by comparing liquid assets\u2014those that can easily be exchanged to create cash flow\u2014and short-term liabilities. The comparison allows you to determine if the company can make excess investments, pay out bonuses or meet their debt obligations. Companies that are over-leveraged must take steps to reduce the gap between their cash on hand and their debt obligations. When companies are over-leveraged, their liquidity risk is much higher because they have fewer assets to move around. Almost five years since the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the start of the global financial crisis, the global economy continues to feel the aftershocks. Policymakers continue to grapple with the policy response. The start of 2013 saw tail risks recede in the global economy, thanks to policy actions in the U.S. and euro area. While financial market conditions have improved markedly across the board for the last half year or so, the real economy continues to lag. We still are not seeing the levels of growth needed to drive a real global recovery, and we are not generating the jobs needed for the millions who have fallen into unemployment over the past five years.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/global-economic-crisis-liquidity-management/","imageUri":"https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5621730_1d0d.jpg","duration":"3 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"169.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Bankers, Accountants, People wanting to make a career in commercial Banks, Anyone who wants to learn about how risk management takes place in banks"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":0,"averageValue":"0.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"EDUCBA Bridging the Gap","url":"/user/premananda-suna/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":0}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"EDUCBA202","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/master-course-in-comptia-a-core-1-core-2-101-level/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5615594,"title":"Master Course in CompTIA A\u002B (Core 1 \u0026 Core 2 - 101 Level)","shortDescription":"CompTIA A\u002B (Core 1 \u0026 Core 2), Hardware, Operating Systems, Software Troubleshooting, Mobile Devices, Virtualization","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMaster Course in CompTIA A\u002B (Core 1 \u0026amp; Core 2) - 101 level\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe CompTIA A\u002B certification is a globally recognized credential that validates your foundational knowledge and skills in the world of IT.

If left unaddressed, the incurrence of operational risk can cause monetary loss, competitive disadvantage, employee- or customer-related problems, and business failure.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/operational-risk-management-us-and-uk-markets/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5621726_8470.jpg","duration":"1.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"171.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Bankers, Accountants, People wanting to make a career in commercial Banks, Anyone who wants to learn about how risk management takes place in banks"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":0,"averageValue":"0.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"EDUCBA Bridging the Gap","url":"/user/premananda-suna/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":0}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"EDUCBA202","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-developer-associate-practice-exams-new/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4698444,"title":"AWS Certified Developer Associate Practice Exams","shortDescription":"AWS Certified Developer Associate | Practice Exams for AWS Certified Developer Associate","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EEmbark on your journey to ace the \u003Cstrong\u003EAWS Certified Developer Associate (DVA-C02)\u003C/strong\u003E exam with the robust practice test course.

An IPO allows a company to raise equity capital from public investors. The transition from a private to a public company can be an important time for private investors to fully realize gains from their investment as it typically includes a share premium for current private investors. Meanwhile, it also allows public investors to participate in the offering.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first step in the IPO process is for the issuing company to choose an investment bank to advise the company on its IPO and to provide underwriting services. Underwriting is the process through which an investment bank (the underwriter) acts as a broker between the issuing company and the investing public to help the issuing company sell its initial set of shares. After the IPO is approved by the SEC, the effective date is decided. On the day before the effective date, the issuing company and the underwriter decide the offer price (i.e., the price at which the shares will be sold by the issuing company) and the precise number of shares to be sold. Deciding the offer price is important because it is the price at which the issuing company raises capital for itself. After the issue has been brought to the market, the underwriter has to provide analyst recommendations, after-market stabilization, and create a market for the stock issued. The final stage of the IPO process, the transition to market competition, starts 25 days after the initial public offering, once the \u201Cquiet period\u201D mandated by the SEC ends.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/fund-raising-through-ipos-and-fpos/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5621716_e72a.jpg","duration":"3 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"165.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Students and Professionals"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":0,"averageValue":"0.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"EDUCBA Bridging the Gap","url":"/user/premananda-suna/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":0}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"EDUCBA202","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/devops-practice-tests-chatgpt-for-devops/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5621874,"title":"DevOps Practice Tests: Master ChatGPT for Devops.","shortDescription":"Ace the DevOps MCQs with Hands-on Practice Tests and Optimize ChatGPT with Devops for High-Quality Applications.","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EAre you ready to take your DevOps skills to the next level?

By taking such a step, the aim of the private equity firm is to earn a return of 20 -25 percent which is far in excess of the \u201Chistorical average annual return\u201D in case of the stock markets. The leveraged buyouts are more or less same to the normal deals of merger and acquisitions; the only difference is that in a leveraged buyout, the assumption is that the buyer will be selling the target in future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe working of the Concept of Leveraged BuyOut and LBO Model\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere exists a similarity between purchasing a house and leveraged buyout as a combination of down payment as well as a mortgage can be made use of. In the case of both these transactions, there is saving of money as a small amount is put down in cash and the remaining is borrowed. In case of the leveraged buyout, the \u201Cdown payment\u201D is known as the equity or the cash whereas the \u201Cmortgage\u201D is known as the debt. The debt is utilised by the private equity firms for boosting its returns. If everything else is equivalent, it means that if the private equity firm makes use of more leverage or debt, the firm is likely to earn a higher rate of return on the investment that has been made by it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as the real LBO model is concerned, the repayment of debt is made by the companies over a period of time which boosts the returns of the private equity firm even more. The numbers show a significant improvement with leverage due to the following reasons \u2013\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat money is worth today is higher than what it will be worth in future- This means that earning higher amount of money 5 years from now will be great, however, it is much better t=if that same amount of money is saved today because of money\u2019s time value.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEarning a higher amount of return on a money of a smaller amount is much more easy\u2013 It is difficult for the portfolio managers with thousands of crores under management to earn rates of return that are high, however for individual investors who have for example made investments of less than one crore, it is much easier to earn returns that are higher. This is the reason why leverage is used by the private equity firms. It goes on to boost their returns in a significant way by bringing reductions in the upfront investment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBuilding a LBO Model\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELBO Modeling is a process that can be divided into 8 steps.
