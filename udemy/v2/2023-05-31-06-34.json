We live in an era of sound bites and 140 character messages, but good writing still matters when it comes to marketing your business. Some would argue it\u2019s more important than ever in today\u2019s competitive landscape, especially with the burgeoning role of social media.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGood Copywriting Is Invisible\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell-written copy delivers your message without attracting attention to the mechanics of your sentences. If you\u2019ve ever read a poorly-written copy, you know the opposite occurs. You find you\u2019re not focused on the message but rather the awkwardness of the statement or the careless choice of words. It slows your reading pace and distracts you from the ideas you\u2019re trying to convey.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat Constitutes Good Writing?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReaders want you to get to the point. They\u2019re busy. They have other media competing for their attention. Make it easy and enjoyable for them to glide through your paragraphs. Good writing is simple. It\u2019s easy to understand. It lacks unnecessary complexity. The vocabulary is varied but not pretentious. Why choose a fancy, multi-syllabic word when a shorter one will do (i.e. use vs. utilize, often vs. oftentimes)? Weed out extra words to improve clarity. Get rid of redundancies, cliches and fluff. Delete energy-sapping words like: very, really, just, quite and rather. What makes writing even more interesting than its style is its substance. Focus on content over craft. Deliver your message in its purest form. Your content will pack more power and inspire a greater response.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Art of Persuasion Begins With Good Copy\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThink of your copy\u2013whether for an ad, brochure or website\u2013as your secret salesperson. Its job, much like a salesperson\u2019s, is to persuade the reader to buy your product or service. Be sure it will make a favorable impression, one that is consistent with your branding. In today\u2019s media-rich world, there\u2019s no shortage of messages competing for your customers\u2019 attention. You don\u2019t want to lose out because your copy is ineffective. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat Skills Do You Need to have an Effective SEO Copywriter?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, you need copywriting skills but beyond that you need to know how to sell. You can be the best copywriter in the world but if you\u2019re ineffective at selling, you won\u2019t succeed. You also need to understand how businesses operate. How do they make money? What is their business model? Who is their competition? How do they market their products or services?

Do you see your children spinning incredible tales and stories in their fantasy play as we used to when we played \u201Ccops and robbers\u201D or \u201Chouse\u201D? Or does your child\u2019s fantasy play seem to consist only of repetitive movements which have no story to them? I am sure you are aware of such a situation\u2026 Nowadays children are no longer as creative as they once were.\u0026nbsp; We live in an era obsessed with numbers, data, and test scores, especially as they apply to our kids and their education.\u0026nbsp; Seeing the decline in creativity should make us concerned about our children\u2019s capacities to innovate, problem-solve, and navigate new and unfamiliar situations. \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the world of child development, you may hear the phrases like \u201Ccritical thinking skills\u201D and \u201Ccreative problem-solving abilities\u201D when referring to goals for your child\u2019s cognitive development. What we are really talking about is\u2026 imagination. The way to create human beings with imagination is to provide them with opportunities to develop it for themselves when they are very young. These opportunities are found in one place and one place only\u2026 that is, play. Played with paints, playing with play dough, costumes, glue, and crayons. Making a mess. Exploring the woods. Splashing in a puddle. Wondering at a caterpillar you notice inching by you. Pretending to be a bird, gliding through the sky.

If you :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Are a student and want to learn about new technologies\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Are interested about this topic but don\u0027t know were to find good resources about it\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Want to know how to work with different tools used for quantum computing\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Simply curious about the topic and you want to learn more about it\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen this course is definitely for you and you will love it. Not only you will learn different theoretical concepts that are really useful in quantum computing but you will also use different tools to practice everything that you have learned. Finally, you will not only have an introduction to the topic but also to Microsoft Q the programming language used for quantum computing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe structure of the course\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way this course is designed will help learn all the concepts that you need to be able to understand the basics of Quantum Computing. Indeed, you will at first learn all the basics of mathematics especially linear algebra. Once again, you will not become a specialist in this field but you will at least understand the basic concepts of it that can be useful for your understanding of quantum computing. Then, you will learn what exactly is an algorithm and what is the difference between a quantum algorithm and a classical mathematical algorithm. Also, we are going to cover different quantum algorithms that are also really popular in this field. Finally, you will have an introduction to Microsoft Q. In my opinion this is pretty important to learn because this is the programming language that is used to perform different quantum calculations as well as testing or running different quantum apps. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, it\u0027s really important to understand that I created this course on the Principe of learning by practice. This is why even if this course is mostly theoretical, I\u0026nbsp;tried to implement as much practice as possible. This way, when you will have completed this course you will not only be able to understand the basics of what is quantum computing but you will also be able to write basic lines of code and have a basic understanding of different quantum algorithms.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFor who is this course designed\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis course is created for beginners who have no prior knowledge of what is quantum computing and are interested by the topic.

Products look better than ever, interfaces feel intuitive, and companies are hiring designers at an increasing rate. But, the designer\u2019s role has been changing over the last few years. It\u2019s no longer enough to iterate and understand your user, instead in today\u2019s world, designers should be able to do both \u2013 identify problems and build solutions, which will increase their worth by at least 10 times for any company.

They could be individuals who know they need to get a leg up in order to get to the next step in their careers.

Google Cloud is built on the same robust global infrastructure that securely and reliably delivers these services to the world. We offer a complete platform addressing the compute, storage, networking, security, and AI/ML needs of a successful cloud enhanced EDA strategy. One of the basic services of a cloud is infrastructure as a service (IaaS). In this service, customers customize the infrastructure they need, acquire it almost instantly when needed and have the capability to discard it when not needed. IaaS provides customers with best-in class compute when they need it - with virtually no limits. Google Cloud is one of the prominent cloud providers with the industry\u2019s best IaaS offerings (described more in \u2018Compute\u2019). Cloud also offers several types of storage. It is a common misconception that storage on cloud is expensive. On the contrary, cloud offers several tiers of storage, where correct selection of storage for tasks can make the total cost of storage very reasonable for most data center needs. Google Cloud offers low latency storage solutions that can meet the requirements of typical chip design customers. AI and ML are ubiquitous in every industry, and every company is looking to leverage its data such that it can increase its impact.

AutoCAD is primarily used for 2 Dimensional drawings, and even though 3D modeling is available in AutoCAD other computer-aided design software like Fusion 360, Inventor and Solidworks are preferred in 3D modeling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAutoCAD is used in industry, by architects, project managers, engineers, graphic designers, city planners and other professionals.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAutoCAD was derived from a program that began in 1977, and then released in 1979[4] called Interact CAD,[5][6][7] also referred to in early Autodesk documents as MicroCAD, which was written prior to Autodesk\u0027s (then Marinchip Software Partners) formation by Autodesk cofounder Michael Riddle.[8][9]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first version by Autodesk was demonstrated at the 1982 Comdex and released that December. AutoCAD supported CP/M-80 computers.[10] As Autodesk\u0027s flagship product, by March 1986 AutoCAD had become the most ubiquitous CAD program worldwide.[11] The 2022 release marked the 36th major release of AutoCAD for Windows and the 12th consecutive year of AutoCAD for Mac. The native file format of AutoCAD is .dwg. This and, to a lesser extent, its interchange file format \u003Cem\u003EDXF\u003C/em\u003E, have become de facto, if proprietary, standards for CAD data interoperability, particularly for 2D drawing exchange.[12] AutoCAD has included support for .dwf, a format developed and promoted by Autodesk, for publishing CAD data.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/autocad-2d-advanced-level-quiz/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5320862_8c58.jpg","duration":"32 questions","enrolledStudentsCount":"132.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["For AutoCAD Users"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":0,"averageValue":"0.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"Ashish Pandit","url":"/user/ashish-pandit-56/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":0}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"2F2272F5C9DFD5CB124C","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"2 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-goal-achievement-course-personal-success-goals/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":3264174,"title":"Complete Goal Achievement Course - Personal Success Goals","shortDescription":"Goal Achievement In Your Life Now!

Developed and marketed by Autodesk,[1] AutoCAD was first released in December 1982 as a desktop app running on microcomputers with internal graphics controllers.[2] Before AutoCAD was introduced, most commercial CAD programs ran on mainframe computers or minicomputers, with each CAD operator (user) working at a separate graphics terminal.[3] AutoCAD is also available as mobile and web apps. AutoCAD is primarily used for 2 Dimensional drawings, and even though 3D modeling is available in AutoCAD other computer-aided design software like Fusion 360, Inventor and Solidworks are preferred in 3D modeling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAutoCAD is used in industry, by architects, project managers, engineers, graphic designers, city planners and other professionals.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAutoCAD was derived from a program that began in 1977, and then released in 1979[4] called Interact CAD,[5][6][7] also referred to in early Autodesk documents as MicroCAD, which was written prior to Autodesk\u0027s (then Marinchip Software Partners) formation by Autodesk cofounder Michael Riddle.[8][9]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first version by Autodesk was demonstrated at the 1982 Comdex and released that December. AutoCAD supported CP/M-80 computers.[10] As Autodesk\u0027s flagship product, by March 1986 AutoCAD had become the most ubiquitous CAD program worldwide.[11] The 2022 release marked the 36th major release of AutoCAD for Windows and the 12th consecutive year of AutoCAD for Mac. The native file format of AutoCAD is .dwg. This and, to a lesser extent, its interchange file format \u003Cem\u003EDXF\u003C/em\u003E, have become de facto, if proprietary, standards for CAD data interoperability, particularly for 2D drawing exchange.[12] AutoCAD has included support for .dwf, a format developed and promoted by Autodesk, for publishing CAD data.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/autocad-2d-intermediate-level-quiz/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5320796_77ed_2.jpg","duration":"19 questions","enrolledStudentsCount":"1,421.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["For AutoCAD Users"],"tags":["AutoCAD"],"rating":{"count":1,"averageValue":"5.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"Ashish Pandit","url":"/user/ashish-pandit-56/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":5}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"38E26B438E3C64E50E37","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/how-i-make-15-per-month-trading-options/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":918688,"title":"How I Make Consistent Returns Trading Options","shortDescription":"Learn to create consistent returns, trading one of our core strategies - Iron Condors","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E*****Join over 5,680\u0026nbsp;happy\u0026nbsp;students who have enrolled in this course*****\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELearn how I make consistent returns on my option\u0026nbsp;trades EVERY\u0026nbsp;month.\u003C/strong\u003E\u0026nbsp;This course is a complete step-by-step guide\u0026nbsp;on how to create\u0026nbsp;consistent returns trading Iron Condors.\u003Cstrong\u003E \u003C/strong\u003E\u0026nbsp;We reveal a trading strategy\u0026nbsp;that is commonly used by Hedge Funds, Market Makers and Floor Traders.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003ERequirements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA computer with internet connection\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBEFORE ENROLLING IN THIS COURSE PLEASE COMPLETE OUR FREE COURSE - \u0022Trading Options For Consistent Returns: Options Basics\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EHere is what you will get from this course\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe NavigationTrading Implied Volatility Indicator\u003C/strong\u003E - Load it directly to your trading platform! \u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe NavigationTrading\u0026nbsp;Watch List\u003C/strong\u003E - The most profitable symbols to trade...AND which ones to avoid!\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe NavigationTrading Cheat Sheet\u0026nbsp;\u003C/strong\u003E- A printable 7 step guide to placing your trades\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn to make money trading\u0026nbsp;15 minutes per day.

Includes JSX, Callbacks, Events, \u002B More","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EThis course takes you step-by-step through the process of building a fully functional calculator in React. React, also known as React JS, is a powerful JavaScript library used for building custom, interactive user interfaces using UI components. Some of the most well known examples of organizations using React for their front-end include Netflix, Facebook, and Airbnb. Developed and maintained by Meta along with a community of independent developers, React remains free and open-source. React is a component based library built entirely on JavaScript, which makes it perfect for designing complex UI\u2019s. With React, developers can build encapsulated components that efficiently manage their own state and render UI updates specifically when data changes. For example, think of the automated content refresh feature you see on a twitter feed, or facebook like button. Here the state of the UI component changes on the page, without having to manually refresh when the data is updated. This is just one small, yet powerful feature of React.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThrough a complete hands-on project, this course will teach you all the fundamental principles of React that you must know to become a proficient React developer. We start right from the basics, including the tools needed to get started. From there we dive into JSX, functional components, props, callbacks, and various OnClick events. By this stage, the calculator will have a complete visual display, coupled with functional arithmetic operations. Students then move on to passing parameters in Callback functions, using the React State Hook, and debugging.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn addition to the hands-on React module, we also offer a comprehensive overview of JavaScript for those who need a refresher. Here we start with introducing students to the document object model (DOM) which defines the logical structure of HTML documents. From there we dive into JavaScript to demonstrate various methods in which DOM elements can be manipulated to add interactivity to static components. We start right from the basics, which includes JavaScript placement, and data output. From there we move on to variable declaration, arithmetic operations, operator precedence, data types, and objects. Once the foundations are covered, we move on to more complex operations using Arrays, Conditional Statements, JavaScript comparison operators, booleans and loops. Here students will learn to unleash the true power of JavaScript to render different outcomes based on user interaction. We will explore the use of functions to efficiently handle repetitive tasks and JavaScript events to handle output based on actions and occurrences. The section will conclude with a hands-on project where students will implement their knowledge to build a web based photo gallery and background color changer. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAs you can see this course covers a tremendous bit of ground. Best of all it features Tim Maclachlan - a renowned senior full-stack developer with over 20 years of commercial development experience. As a multi-faceted developer, Tim specializes in algorithmic, analytical and mobile development. To date, he\u2019s written hundreds of applications and worked in a number of industries from commercial aviation and military, to banking and finance.
