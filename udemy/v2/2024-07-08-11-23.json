Students explore the various types of cloud models such as private, public, and hybrid, as well as the service models, including Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS). Here we highlight the growing significance of cloud computing in modern business, emphasizing the need for skilled professionals in this field. In this section we also explore the benefits and drawbacks of different cloud providers, and how to choose the right provider for their needs.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EFrom there, students learn how to deploy cloud servers on Linode, a leading IaaS provider. We teach how to create and manage virtual machines, set up network and security configurations, and deploy web applications.
