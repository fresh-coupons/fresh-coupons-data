I am sure you are aware of such a situation\u2026 Nowadays children are no longer as creative as they once were.\u0026nbsp; We live in an era obsessed with numbers, data, and test scores, especially as they apply to our kids and their education.\u0026nbsp; Seeing the decline in creativity should make us concerned about our children\u2019s capacities to innovate, problem-solve, and navigate new and unfamiliar situations. \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the world of child development, you may hear the phrases like \u201Ccritical thinking skills\u201D and \u201Ccreative problem-solving abilities\u201D when referring to goals for your child\u2019s cognitive development. What we are really talking about is\u2026 imagination. The way to create human beings with imagination is to provide them with opportunities to develop it for themselves when they are very young. These opportunities are found in one place and one place only\u2026 that is, play. Playing with paints, playing with play dough, with costumes, with glue, and with crayons. Making a mess. Exploring the woods. Splashing in a puddle. Wondering at a caterpillar you notice inching by you. Pretending to be a bird, gliding through the sky. All these involve a great deal of imagination and developing their creative skills to many folds.\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, as parents, we must first learn the process of creative learning which we can offer to our kids. We parents should make ourselves aware of the different aspects of creative learning and critical thinking skills so that we can create an environment for our children to flourish in that environment.\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; In this course, we are going to discuss in detail the step-by-step process which you can walk your children through to make them creative learners and achievers.

Start your Android App Development carrer now and be Pro !","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EEven though Kotlin is a full-fledged functional programming language, it preserves most of the object-oriented nature of Java as an alternative programming style, which is very handy when converting existing Java code. Kotlin has classes with constructors, along with nested, inner, and anonymous inner classes, and it has interfaces like Java 8. Kotlin does \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E have a new keyword. To create a class instance, call the constructor just like a regular function. We saw that in the screenshot above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKotlin has single inheritance from a named superclass, and all Kotlin classes have a default superclass Any, which is \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E the same as the Java base class java.lang.Object. Any contains only three predefined member functions: equals(), hashCode(), and toString().\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKotlin classes have to be marked with the open keyword in order to allow other classes to inherit from them; Java classes are kind of the opposite, as they are inheritable \u003Cem\u003Eunless\u003C/em\u003E marked with the final keyword. To override a superclass method, the method itself must be marked open, and the subclass method must be marked override. This is all of a piece with Kotlin\u2019s philosophy of making things explicit rather than relying on defaults. In this particular case, I can see where Kotlin\u2019s way of explicitly marking base class members as open for inheritance and derived class members as overrides avoids several kinds of common Java errors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, you\u0027ll learn how to create apps and run them on virtual devices through guided exercises. You\u0027ll cover the fundamentals of Android development, from structuring an app to building out the UI with Activities and Fragments and various navigation patterns. Progressing through the chapters and lectures, you\u0027ll delve into Android\u0027s RecyclerView to make the most of displaying lists of data and become comfortable with fetching data from a web service and handling images. You\u0027ll then learn about mapping, location services, and the permissions model before working with notifications and how to persist data. Moving on, you\u0027ll get to grips with testing, covering the full spectrum of the test pyramid. You\u0027ll also learn how AAC (Android Architecture Components) are used to cleanly structure your code and explore various architecture patterns and the benefits of dependency injection. \u003Cem\u003EThe core libraries of RxJava and Coroutines are covered for asynchronous programming\u003C/em\u003E. The focus then returns to the UI, demonstrating how to add motion and transitions when users interact with your apps. Towards the end, you\u0027ll build an interesting app to retrieve and display popular movies from a movie database, and then see how to publish your apps on Google Play. By the end of this course, you\u0027ll have the skills and confidence needed to build fully-fledged Android apps using Kotlin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre you trying to start a career in Android programming, but haven\u0027t found the right way in?

If so, then this course is for you\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen Android first arrived in 2008, it was a bit drab compared to the much more stylish iOS on the Apple iPhone/iPad. But, quite quickly, through a variety of handset offers that struck a chord with practical, price-conscious consumers, as well as those who are fashion-conscious and tech-savvy, Android user numbers exploded. For many, myself included, developing for Android is the most rewarding pastime and business, bar none. Quickly putting together a prototype of an idea, refining it, and then deciding to run with it and wire it up into a fully-fledged app, is such an exciting and rewarding process. Any programming can be fun \u2013 I have been programming all my life \u2013 but creating for Android is somehow extraordinarily rewarding..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKotlin is the most succinct language, and therefore is the least error-prone, \u003Cem\u003Ewhich is great for beginners\u003C/em\u003E. Kotlin is also the most fun language, mainly because the succinctness means you can get results faster and with less code. Google considers Kotlin an official (first-class) Android language.

The term digital forensics was originally used as a synonym for computer forensics but has expanded to cover investigation of all devices capable of storing digital data. With roots in the personal computing revolution of the late 1970s and early 1980s, the discipline evolved in a haphazard manner during the 1990s, and it was not until the early 21st century that national policies emerged.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDigital forensics investigations have a variety of applications. The most common is to support or refute a hypothesis before criminal or civil courts. Criminal cases involve the alleged breaking of laws that are defined by legislation and that are enforced by the police and prosecuted by the state, such as theft and assault against the person. Civil cases on the other hand deal with protecting the rights and property of individuals (often associated with family disputes) but may also be concerned with contractual disputes between commercial entities where a form of digital forensics referred to as electronic discovery (ediscovery) may be involved\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring the 1980s very few specialized digital forensic tools existed, and consequently investigators often performed live analysis on media, examining computers from within the operating system using existing sysadmin tools to extract evidence. This practice carried the risk of modifying data on the disk, either inadvertently or otherwise, which led to claims of evidence tampering. A number of tools were created during the early 1990s to address the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDigital forensics is commonly used in both criminal law and private investigation. Traditionally it has been associated with criminal law, where evidence is collected to support or oppose a hypothesis before the courts. As with other areas of forensics this is often a part of a wider investigation spanning a number of disciplines. In some cases, the collected evidence is used as a form of intelligence gathering, used for other purposes than court proceedings (for example to locate, identify or halt other crimes). As a result, intelligence gathering is sometimes held to a less strict forensic standard.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"Ingl\u00E9s","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/digital-forensics-course/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4372164_7752_2.jpg","duration":"11,5 horas","enrolledStudentsCount":"11.409 estudiantes","lastUpdated":"Fecha de la \u00FAltima actualizaci\u00F3n: 1/2022","targetAudiences":["Beginner Digital Forensics Investigators"],"tags":["Inform\u00E1tica y software","Redes y seguridad","Investigaci\u00F3n forense digital"],"rating":{"count":52,"averageValue":"4.1"},"instructors":[{"name":"OCSALY - Online Computer Science Academy","url":"/user/online-academy-of-computer-science/","totalNumberOfStudents":22292,"totalNumberOfReviews":122,"averageRating":3.983280255140187}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"FORENSICS22","originalPrice":"\u20B911,200","discountedPrice":"\u20B97,280","expirationText":"5 hours","discountPercentage":35}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/amazon-elastic-compute-cloud-ec2-beginners/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4366450,"title":"Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) Beginners Certification","shortDescription":"Learn to Setup, Configure, and Administer EC2 Instances on AWS.

This course provides an in-depth overview of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). The EC2 service is an essential building block in becoming an AWS certified cloud practitioner. We will start with exploring key concepts relevant to EC2, followed by a hands-on practical guide to deploying compute resources on AWS. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe term \u201CScalable Cloud Computing\u201D has now become synonymous with Amazon Web Services. For nearly a decade, AWS has been powering some of the world\u2019s most popular websites and applications. Amazon EC2, is considered the computational backbone of AWS.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ETo illustrate how Amazon EC2 works, we explore the concept of virtualization. Virtualization is the process of creating a software-based virtual representation of a server. When we deploy an EC2 \u201CInstance\u201D we\u2019re creating a virtual representation of a physical server and it\u2019s resources.\u003Cstrong\u003E \u003C/strong\u003EThis includes: CPU, Memory (RAM), Storage, and network resources such as Bandwidth. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ESimilar to physical servers that you might find on-premises,\u003Cstrong\u003E \u003C/strong\u003Evirtual EC2 instances can also have different configurations. As a matter of fact, AWS offers the most comprehensive configuration options when it comes to deploying virtual servers.\u003Cstrong\u003E \u003C/strong\u003EThese configurations can easily be adapted to our resource needs, in real-time.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe level of customization a cloud provider can accommodate, will define the sophistication level of it\u2019s overall service. Not all cloud services were created equal. AWS, is known to have the highest level of configuration options when compared to just about any other service. The AWS platform caters to both micro and enterprise level clients, using one of the most scalable and advanced virtualization infrastructures available.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EBeyond the physical hardware customization and scalability, virtualization also accommodates the deployment of any operating system on the virtual machine. As you will see, we have the flexibility of deploying both Linux and Windows servers, using a variety of pre-configured virtual applications known as AMIs (Amazon Machine Images).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to a theoretical deep dive into Amazon EC2, this course will also provide you with practical hands-on experience in working with the key features of EC2.

For example, the ignition system was only responsible for supplying the voltage needed to fire the spark plugs. Ignition timing was controlled by vacuum and mechanical advance systems. Today there are very few electrical systems that are still independent. Today, most manufacturers network their electrical systems together through computers. This means that information gathered by one system can be used by another. The result may be that a faulty component may cause several symptoms. Consider the following example. The wiper system can interact with the headlight system to turn on the headlights whenever the wipers are turned on. The wipers can interact with the vehicle speed sensor to provide for speed-sensitive wiper operation. The speed sensor may provide information to the antilock brake module. The antilock brake module can then share this information with the transmission control module, and the instrument cluster can receive vehicle speed information to operate the speedometer. If the vehicle speed sensor should fail, this could result in antilock brake operation and a warning light turned on in the dash. But it could also result in the speedometer not functioning, the transmission not shifting, and the wipers not operating properly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe computer is an electronic device that stores and processes data and are capable of operating other devices. The use of computers on automobiles has expanded to include control and operation of several functions, including climate control, lighting circuits, cruise control, antilock braking, electronic suspension systems, and electronic shift transmissions. Some of these are functions of what is known as a body control module (BCM). Some body computer-controlled systems include direction lights, rear window defogger, illuminated entry, intermittent wipers, and other systems that were once thought of as basic. A computer processes the physical conditions that represent information (data). The operation of the computer is divided into four basic functions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Input.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Processing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Storage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Output.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVehicle Communication NetworksMost manufacturers now use a system of vehicle communications called multiplexing(MUX) to allow control modules to share information. Multiplexing provides the ability to use a single circuit to distribute and share data between several control modules throughout the vehicle. Because the data is transmitted through a single circuit, bulky wiring harnesses are eliminated. Vehicle manufacturers will use multiplexing systems to enable different control modules to share information. A MUX wiring system uses bus data links that connect each module. The term bus refers to the transporting of data from one module to another. Each module can transmit and receive digital codes over the bus data links. The signal sent from a sensor can go to any one of the modules and can be shared by the other modules. Electronic Accessory systems with the growing use of computers, most systems can be controlled electronically. This provides for improved monitoring of the systems for proper operation and the ability to detect if a fault occurs. Electronic Cruise Control Systems. Cruise control is a system that allows the vehicle to maintain a preset speed with the driver\u2019s foot off of the accelerator. Most cruise control systems are a combination of electrical and mechanical components. Memory Seats. The memory seat feature allows the driver to program different seat positions that can be recalled at the push of a button. The memory seat feature is an addition to the basic power seat system. Most memory seat systems share the same basic operating principles, the difference being in programming methods and the number of positions that can be programmed. Most systems provide for two-seat positions to be stored in memory. An easy exit feature may be an additional function of the memory seat that provides for easier entrance and exit of the vehicle by moving the seat all the way back and down. Some systems also move the steering wheel up and to full retract. Electronic Sunroofs. Some manufacturers have introduced electronic control of their electric sunroofs. These systems incorporate a pair of relay circuits and a timer function into the control module. Motor rotation is controlled by relays that are activated according to signals received from the slide, tilt, and limit switches.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/automotive-electrician-and-mechanic-training-aemt-2022/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4493870_9a11_2.jpg","duration":"2 hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"1,011 students","lastUpdated":"Last updated 1/2022","targetAudiences":["Beginner Automotive Electricians"],"tags":["Teaching \u0026 Academics","Engineering","Car Repair"],"rating":{"count":3,"averageValue":"3.3"},"instructors":[{"name":"OCSALY - Online Computer Science Academy","url":"/user/online-academy-of-computer-science/","totalNumberOfStudents":22292,"totalNumberOfReviews":122,"averageRating":3.983280255140187}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"ELECTRICIAN22","originalPrice":"7.680\u00A0INR","discountedPrice":"4.992\u00A0INR","expirationText":"5 horas","discountPercentage":35}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/powershell-create-a-desktop-application-gui/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4452012,"title":"Powershell : Create a desktop application GUI","shortDescription":"Develop a standalone application Tool using Powershell","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know \u003Cstrong\u003EJAVA\u003C/strong\u003E, \u003Cbr\u003EI don\u0027t know \u003Cstrong\u003EVB \u003C/strong\u003Escripting ,\u003Cbr\u003EI don\u0027t know any \u003Cstrong\u003Edevelopment languages\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/strong\u003EI cannot buy \u003Cstrong\u003Eany third party application for development\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/strong\u003EI am not a \u003Cstrong\u003Eprogrammer\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EI ONLY KNOW POWERSHELL\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYET I need to create a desktop application..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan I?

It produces the power that turns the wheels and electricity for lights and other systems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost automobiles are powered by an internal combustion engine. Fuel, usually gasoline or petrol, is burned with air to create gases that expand. A spark plug creates a spark that ignites the gas and makes it burn. This energy moves through cylinders in which pistons slide up and down. They are attached to rods that move a crankshaft. Normal car engines have four to six cylinders but there are also models with eight and sixteen cylinders. The turning movement is passed through the drivetrain to the drive wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe engine and all parts that carry power to the wheels are called the drivetrain. It includes the transmission, drive shaft, differential, the axles and the drive wheels that move the car. While most cars have drive wheels in the front, some have them in the back. Cars that need to drive over all kinds of ground have a four-wheel drive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe transmission controls the speed and torque. When a car travels at a normal speed on a flat road it does not need so much torque to keep it moving, but when you want to start a car from a hill the engine must produce more power. Gears control speed and power of the engine in different driving conditions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn cars with manual transmission you have to change gears by pressing down the clutch with your foot and moving a lever. Cars with automatic transmission change gears without control by the driver. Lower gears give the car more torque and speed. When the car moves faster the transmission shifts to higher gears.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe driveshaft carries the power to the axle which is connected to the wheels. It has several joints which make the axle and wheels moveable as the car drives on uneven and bumpy roads.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe differential is connected to the rear end of the driveshaft. It lets the wheels turn at different speeds because in curves the outer wheels must travel a greater distance than the inner ones.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"Ingl\u00E9s","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/car-repair-auto-mechanic-training-masterclass-crtc-2021/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4408498_f040_5.jpg","duration":"5 horas","enrolledStudentsCount":"6.058 estudiantes","lastUpdated":"Fecha de la \u00FAltima actualizaci\u00F3n: 1/2022","targetAudiences":["Beginner car mechanics"],"tags":["Ense\u00F1anzas y disciplinas acad\u00E9micas","Ingenier\u00EDa","Reparaci\u00F3n de autom\u00F3viles"],"rating":{"count":18,"averageValue":"3.5"},"instructors":[{"name":"OCSALY - Online Computer Science Academy","url":"/user/online-academy-of-computer-science/","totalNumberOfStudents":22292,"totalNumberOfReviews":122,"averageRating":3.983280255140187}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"TUNING22","originalPrice":"11.840\u00A0INR","discountedPrice":"7.696\u00A0INR","expirationText":"5 horas","discountPercentage":35}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/c-and-java-programming-complete-training-course/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4526840,"title":"C\u002B\u002B And Java Programming Complete Training Course","shortDescription":"Learn C\u002B\u002B And Java Programming Complete Training Course 2022","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EC\u002B\u002B\u0026nbsp;And Java Complete Training Course For Beginners\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E1)\u0026nbsp; C\u002B\u002B Complete Course \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis course is an introduction to the C\u002B\u002B programming language and its subset, the C\u002B\u002B programming language.
