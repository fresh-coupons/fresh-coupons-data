In this Networking course, we\u0027re going to cover the science of networking including the different types of networking groups, the different type of networking formats, and how to start your own networking groups. We are also going to cover the Art of Networking so you can choose the right groups to start, build long-lasting relationships, and maximize your impact in your ever growing sphere of influence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt doesn\u0027t matter what your industry is. Without mastering the art of networking, one cannot thrive. Although you may be self-sufficient, building relationships is an art. Entrepreneur India spoke with Ivan Miser, founder of Business Network International (BNI), a world-leading business networking and business referral organisation. He tells us how to master the art of networking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImagine that you have just entered a large room full of strangers. You want to make friends, have a conversation and build a network. How do you become the ultimate networker, however?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPeople are unable to use networking as a face-to-face cold calling opportunity. This is what holds them back. People say hello to people at networking events and then go on to say \u0022Hi, let us do business.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey are more interested in selling than building relationships. Networking is not about hunting, but about farming. It\u0027s all about building relationships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnroll today!\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/business-networking-part-9-attracting-your-ideal-client/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/3371492_7598_2.jpg","duration":"2 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"3,599.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Sales people","Marketers","Udemy instructors","Entrepreneurs","Small Businesses"],"tags":["Personal Networking"],"rating":{"count":3,"averageValue":"4.1"},"instructors":[{"name":"Scott Paton","url":"/user/scottpaton/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.1666665},{"name":"Scott Alex","url":"/user/scott-alex-2/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.1666665},{"name":"Chaffee-Thanh Nguyen","url":"/user/chaffeethanhnguyen/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.1666665}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"BNP9AYICEXPJAN242024","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"2 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/becoming-amazon-seller-the-zero-risk-zero-budget-method/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5246992,"title":"How To Become A Top Amazon Seller Without Risking Your Money","shortDescription":"How to learn all the skills of top Amazon sellers with ZERO risk and ZERO budget (and MAKE MONEY while learning!)","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003ESo you\u0027re looking to become a seller on Amazon, right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ve heard of normal people making lots of money with a few simple products, and you want to join the fun and make loads of money yourself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThing is, you\u0027ve got two problems in front if you:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 - You \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Elack the starting money to invest \u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003Ein this business, or it\u0027s too much for you to risk\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 - Even though you\u0027ve looked at courses and tutorials, you have \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ezero practical experience,\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E making the risk even greater\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes that ring true to you?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe hard truth is, over \u003Cstrong\u003E95% of wannabe Amazon sellers fail within one year to make any profit,\u003C/strong\u003E simply because they have too little experience and capital (money).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAmazon may be a goldmine, but there\u0027s a lot of competition.\u0026nbsp;Any course stating that it\u0027s easy money is \u003Cem\u003Ewrong\u003C/em\u003E (trust me, selling on Amazon is my full-time day job!).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0027s worse, you could actually lose \u003Cem\u003Ethousands of dollars \u003C/em\u003Etrying to sell without proper experience.
