At its core, HTML provides the basic structure and content of a webpage. It uses a system of tags and attributes to define elements like headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more. These tags act as containers for content, allowing developers to create a meaningful and organized layout for their webpages.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you begin your study of HTML, you will learn about the key elements that make up the structure of a webpage. These include the doctype declaration, the html element, head and body elements, and a variety of content-specific tags. You will also explore semantic HTML, which emphasizes the use of meaningful tags to convey the purpose and structure of content, ultimately making the web more accessible and search-engine friendly.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECSS: Styling the Web\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/strong\u003EWhile HTML provides the foundation of a webpage, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) brings it to life with style and flair. CSS is a stylesheet language that allows developers to control the visual presentation of HTML elements, including colors, fonts, layout, and even animations. By separating content (HTML) from presentation (CSS), developers can create consistent and maintainable designs across multiple webpages.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThroughout this course, you will explore various CSS properties and selectors that allow you to target and style specific HTML elements.

In this course, you will learn how to effectively manage and optimize your storage on Amazon Web Services (AWS). This includes a comprehensive overview of the main forms of EC2 storage offered by AWS, including Elastic Block Store (EBS), Elastic File System (EFS), and Amazon Machine Images (AMI).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe course starts with the foundations of AWS, where we demonstrate how to register an AWS account. Students also learn the basics of AWS billing, global vs. regional services, and AWS multi-factor authentication (MFA). \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOnce students are familiar with navigating the AWS dashboard, we dive into working with the EC2 service. Here we explore the core features of EC2 instances, along with instance deployment, instance administration, and security. Students will learn how to create and deploy instances from Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) that are fully equipped with Elastic IP addresses, and remote access via terminal and PuTTY. We also cover a host of other integral concepts including IAM roles for EC2, Security Groups, and EC2 Instance Launch Templates. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAfter the EC2 section, we delve into AWS EC2 storage solutions. Here, we start with exploring the key differences between block, file, and object storage. From there, we take a deep dive into Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS). EBS is a block storage service provided by AWS which allows for the creation of virtual disks, called EBS volumes that can be attached to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances. These EBS volumes can be used as raw block devices, in order to store data, such as system files, application data, and virtual machine images. We will cover how to create, attach, and manage EBS volumes, as well as how to use EBS Snapshots to create point-in-time backups of your data. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EFrom there, we explore Amazon Machine Images (AMIs), which are templates that contain the software configuration and data required to launch an EC2 instance. We will cover how to create and customize AMIs, as well as how to use the EC2 Image Builder to automate the creation of AMIs. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn the last section, we introduce students to the Elastic File System (EFS), which is a file storage service provided by AWS. EFS allows you to create a file system that can be accessed by multiple EC2 instances to store and share files across multiple availability zones. We will cover how to create and manage EFS file systems, as well as how to mount EFS file systems on your EC2 instances. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EBy the end of this course, you will have a solid understanding of the various storage options available on AWS, and you will be able to confidently choose the right storage solution for your needs.

Includes JSX, Callbacks, Events, \u002B More","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EThis course takes you step-by-step through the process of building a fully functional calculator in React. React, also known as React JS, is a powerful JavaScript library used for building custom, interactive user interfaces using UI components. Some of the most well known examples of organizations using React for their front-end include Netflix, Facebook, and Airbnb. Developed and maintained by Meta along with a community of independent developers, React remains free and open-source. React is a component based library built entirely on JavaScript, which makes it perfect for designing complex UI\u2019s. With React, developers can build encapsulated components that efficiently manage their own state and render UI updates specifically when data changes. For example, think of the automated content refresh feature you see on a twitter feed, or facebook like button. Here the state of the UI component changes on the page, without having to manually refresh when the data is updated. This is just one small, yet powerful feature of React.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThrough a complete hands-on project, this course will teach you all the fundamental principles of React that you must know to become a proficient React developer. We start right from the basics, including the tools needed to get started. From there we dive into JSX, functional components, props, callbacks, and various OnClick events. By this stage, the calculator will have a complete visual display, coupled with functional arithmetic operations. Students then move on to passing parameters in Callback functions, using the React State Hook, and debugging.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn addition to the hands-on React module, we also offer a comprehensive overview of JavaScript for those who need a refresher. Here we start with introducing students to the document object model (DOM) which defines the logical structure of HTML documents. From there we dive into JavaScript to demonstrate various methods in which DOM elements can be manipulated to add interactivity to static components. We start right from the basics, which includes JavaScript placement, and data output. From there we move on to variable declaration, arithmetic operations, operator precedence, data types, and objects. Once the foundations are covered, we move on to more complex operations using Arrays, Conditional Statements, JavaScript comparison operators, booleans and loops. Here students will learn to unleash the true power of JavaScript to render different outcomes based on user interaction. We will explore the use of functions to efficiently handle repetitive tasks and JavaScript events to handle output based on actions and occurrences. The section will conclude with a hands-on project where students will implement their knowledge to build a web based photo gallery and background color changer. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAs you can see this course covers a tremendous bit of ground.

Why should we build a sneaker dropshipping business? Among many reasons, here are the main three reasons why you should consider starting a custom sneaker dropshipping business, the first one is the large market size which is approximated to be around 73.7 Billion dollars made this product to be definitely one of the most prospective product that you can sell in today\u2019s market. Meanwhile the second reason why is the fact that sneakers has always been in high demand in the market for all demographics and generations, whether you are millennials, generation Z, upper middle class or even lower middle class, it is very likely that you or your family member at very least have sneakers in your house. Hence, it would be pretty fair to claim that sneakers relatively has wide range of potential customers. Then the third reason has something to do with trends.

When a human being ascends the steps of the pyramid, self-actualization is reached. Beyond the routine of needs fulfillment, Maslow envisioned moments of extraordinary experience, known as peak experiences, profound moments of love, understanding, happiness, or rapture, during which a person feels more whole, alive, self-sufficient, and yet a part of the world. This is similar to the flow concept of Mih\u00E1ly Cs\u00EDkszentmih\u00E1lyi. The concept of flow is the idea that after our basic needs are met we can achieve greater happiness by altering our consciousness by becoming so engaged in a task that we lose our sense of time.
