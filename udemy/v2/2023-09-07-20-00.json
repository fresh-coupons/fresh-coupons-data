This is a comprehensive project based course where you will learn step by step on how to perform complex analysis and visualisation on real estate market data. This course will be mainly concentrating on forecasting the future housing market using two different forecasting models, those are linear regression and LSTM which stands for long short term memory. Regarding programming language, we are going to use Python alongside several libraries like Pandas for performing data modelling, Numpy for performing complex calculations, Matplotlib for visualising the data, and Scikit-learn for implementing the linear regression model and various evaluation metrics. Whereas, for the data, we are going to download the real estate market dataset from Kaggle. In the introduction session, you will learn basic fundamentals of real estate market forecasting, such as getting to know the characteristics of the real estate market, forecasting models that will be used, and major problems in the real estate market nowadays like limited housing supply and population growth. Then, continue by learning the basic mathematics behind linear regression where you will be guided step by step on how to analyze case study and perform basic linear regression calculation. This session was designed to prepare your knowledge and understanding about linear regression before implementing this concept to your code. Afterward, you will learn several different factors that can potentially impact the real estate market, such as population growth, government policies, and infrastructure development. Once you\u2019ve learnt all necessary knowledge about the real estate market, we will start the forecasting project. Firstly, you will be guided step by step on how to set up Google Colab IDE, then, you will also learn how to find and download datasets from Kaggle. Once everything is all set, you will enter the main section of the course which is the project section. The project will consist of two main parts, the first one is forecasting the real estate market trend using linear regression while the second one is forecasting the real estate market trend using a long short term memory model. Lastly, at the end of the course, you will learn how to evaluate the accuracy and performance of your forecasting models using R-squared and directional symmetry methods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, before getting into the course, we need to ask ourselves these questions: why should we learn to forecast the real estate market? What\u2019s the benefit? Well, I have a ton of answers to those questions. Firstly, the real estate market has always been considered a strong investment option due to its potential for long-term appreciation and income generation. Property values tend to appreciate over time, offering the opportunity for capital gains, while rental income from properties can provide a steady cash flow. Meanwhile, as big data technology has advanced very rapidly in the past few years, integrating this technology to forecast future market trends and prices by identifying patterns in the historical data can be very beneficial as it allows investors to make a data driven investment decision. In addition, these skill sets that you learn are extremely valuable as they can be applied to different markets other than real estate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow are things that you can expect to learn from this course:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn basic fundamentals of real estate market forecasting, such as getting to know market characteristics and major problems faced by real estate market\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to perform linear regression calculations and gain an understanding of regression coefficients, intercepts, dependent variables, and independent variables\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn several factors that can potentially impact real estate market, such as population growth, job market, and infrastructure development\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to find and download datasets from Kaggle\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to upload data to Google Colab Studio\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to clean datasets by removing rows with missing values and duplicates\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to detect potential outliers in the dataset\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to analyze property price trend by calculating its annual mean and median\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to find correlation between property price and property type\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to analyze real estate market trend and find investment opportunities using sales ratio calculation\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to forecast real estate market trend using linear regression model\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to forecast real estate market trend using LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) model\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to evaluate the accuracy and performance of the forecasting models using R-squared analysis and directional symmetry analysis\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/forecasting-real-estate-market-with-linear-regression-lstm/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5538602_61c6.jpg","duration":"3.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"1,203.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["People who are interested in forecasting real estate market using linear regression and LSTM model","People who are interested in analysing and visualising complex dataset using Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy, Seaborn, and Scikit Learn","People who are interested in real estate investment"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":0,"averageValue":"0.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"Christ Raharja","url":"/user/christ-raharja/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":0}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"DCE78D62DA6E216EB900","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"3 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/popping-dance-for-beginners/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":3055476,"title":"Popping Dance For Beginners","shortDescription":"Learn 10 BASIC Popping Moves and Techniques!","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELearn from the TOP 1% Popping and Hip Hop Dance instructor in Canada!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave you ever seen robot dancers in the streets?

I have always been a firm believer in learning by doing and in this course, you will learn what you need to know by hands-on experience. You don\u2019t need any special knowledge except basic computer skills to get started with the course. Every one of you comes from a different background and hence the course is crafted from basic to advanced level with minute details in every lecture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe course is divided into 8 sections. In the first section, you will learn in detail about the Asus tinker board and how it is different from its competitor Raspberry Pi.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the second section, we will understand how to burn the OS image to the SD card and use the tinker board as a full-fledged PC. Once we are done with this we will go ahead and understand the IP scanner tool and then use the putty application to access the Linux terminal of the Asus tinker board.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStarting on a Tinker board is not always easy because you don\u2019t necessarily have the habit of using command lines. However, they are essentials and often faster or more efficient than going through the GUI. So in the third section, we will get to know about all the day to day usage Linux commands with practical examples.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fourth section begins with remotely accessing the graphical user interface of the tinker board and understanding the basic GUI applications. Once we are done with this we will go ahead and understand the general-purpose input-output functionality.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the fifth section, we will step into the world of physical computing. We will begin with a basic project where we will learn to program different LEDs and a buzzer. This will help us to understand the GPIO pin structure and how to use them for programming.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe sixth section exposes you to the intermediate level of project development. Here, you will learn to build automatic garden lights. This project will solve your day to day problems of manually turning the light ON in the evening and then turning it off again in the morning. You will learn to program and automate things as per your requirements.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the seventh section, we will go ahead with the advanced project where we will learn to build our own home automation project. We will first understand about the IoT and how it is implemented in real-time. You will learn to control your home appliances from anywhere. For example, If you are in the US, you will be able to turn off your lights from the UK.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, in the eight section, you will come to know how to transfer files remotely from PC to Tinker Board. You will also go through what you have learned so far in the entire course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease note that the project covered in the course will work on any version of the Tinker Board.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAll the lectures contain English subtitles for clear and better understanding. If you face any technical issues, please post your query in the question and answer section and I will get back to you within 1 business day.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the end of the course, you will have a solid foundation on tinker board, relay and sensor usage, IoT dashboard implementation, etc. So apart from building this project, you will also find it easy to build any other project of your choice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank You\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/getting-stared-with-asus-tinker-board/","imageUri":"https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/3503994_2632_7.jpg","duration":"2 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"12,070.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["For beginners who wants to explore the latest Tinker Board","Who wants to build real-time projects to solve day to day problems"],"tags":["Internet Of Things"],"rating":{"count":30,"averageValue":"4.7"},"instructors":[{"name":"Comfiny .","url":"/user/comfiny/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.75},{"name":"Technical Support Team","url":"/user/comfiny-support-team/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.75}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"IOT_PROJECT","originalPrice":"\u20B91,999","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/build-host-manage-super-fast-wordpress-websites-in-10web/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4860890,"title":"Build, Host \u0026 Manage WordPress Websites using AI [10Web]","shortDescription":"Learn Web Design \u0026 Development by creating Responsive WordPress Websites using Elementor \u0026 10Web AI Builder [No Code]","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EWould you like to learn how to \u003Cstrong\u003ECreate Super-Fast and Amazing WordPress Websites using Elementor \u003C/strong\u003Eand manage their backend and development using 10Web web hosting to manage the \u003Cstrong\u003EWebsite\u0027s Security and Performance\u003C/strong\u003E?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere in this course, you will learn how you can design responsive and amazing business and personal websites using \u003Cstrong\u003EElementor Page Builder \u003C/strong\u003Eand \u003Cstrong\u003E10Web\u0027s AI builder \u003C/strong\u003Ewithout any coding or programming knowledge.

It is implemented through a system called jails, as well as a userland utility plus, depending on the system, a number of other utilities. The functionality was committed into FreeBSD in 1999 by Poul-Henning Kamp after some period of production use by a hosting provider and was first released with FreeBSD 4.0, thus being supported on a number of FreeBSD descendants, including DragonFly BSD, to this day.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe need for the FreeBSD jails came from a small shared-environment hosting provider\u0027s (R\u0026amp;D Associates, Inc.\u0027s owner, Derrick T.

step by step in building a strong mentality towards the field of programming and gradually building methods for writing code in the C language in an effective way. In the lecture, we explain the basic theoretical details, in addition to having a practical application for them, then proceed with a practical application session that teaches you ways of thinking and how to apply what you have learned in what is called logical thinking, and apply it in code simply on the code editor, with all the explanation files, codes, and files for the session deliverables.

I started out my sales career in car sales. I loved it except I was only there to gain sales experience and I had to always be there to make a sale. I treated my car sales job as my college years. I was there 3 years, 10 months before I discovered brokering money. I sell other people\u2019s money to small business owners. I sell the sexiest product in the world. The one thing that 90% of the world is chasing, I am selling. It\u2019s perfect and you can do it from anywhere in the world. This isn\u2019t a get rich quick scheme so if you are looking for one, you\u2019ve picked up the wrong course. You will have to work, but you can easily make 7-6 figures doing this. I am going to help you avoid some of my mistakes and get to where you want to be quicker. Like I said in the beginning, I was a car salesman. I got burned out and had a young daughter and I have always known that I just wanted to learn how to sell then do my own thing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHow do you Broker Money? \u003C/strong\u003EBasically, You are an Independent sales Organization or ISO for short. Your job is to find small business owners who need money for their business, the business can be a start-up, the business can be in different industries. I would advise you to pick a niche. (More on that later) Once you find people who are in need of money you then connect them to our friends (direct lenders) who have money for sale. You make money in the middle. Your don\u2019t have to put up any of your own money to fund businesses. There\u2019s limited risk to you. Our job is to simply find people who need money for business purposes. As long as you can help people solve their money problems, you will never have money problems of your own. You can make money as soon as the Day after you get started. In this industry we can get businesses funding within 24 hours and we get paid from the direct lenders after the business is funded. In this course, you will learn how to find deals, how to sell and have the opportunity to work with me directly. \u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/business-loan-broker-product-knowledge-sales-marketing/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5462204_f50f.jpg","duration":"2 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"2,653.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["This course is for people who are looking for a career change or an opportunity to work for themselves from home.","Real estate professionals and Mortgage lenders do well in our industry","This course is great for people who are in car sales and are trying to get into a new industry","This course is for business bankers that want to work for themselves and provide loans for businesses"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":13,"averageValue":"4.5"},"instructors":[{"name":"Amir Towns","url":"/user/amir-towns-2/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.5384617}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"F1D02EA8516F136AA4D9","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"2 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/circular-economy-sustainable-development/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5020516,"title":"Master Course in Circular Economy 3.0","shortDescription":"Behavioral Economics, Corporate Social Responsibility, Climate Change, Environmental, Social and Governance, Sustainable","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EThe circular economy is an evolution of the way the world produces and consumes both goods and services.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe circular model redefines the economy around principles of designing out waste and pollution, keeping products and materials in use for as long as possible.

It varies from person to person, but let\u0027s just say you probably won\u0027t master these in your first few months.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdvanced SEO typically involves technical concepts that are somewhat advanced, and/or a deeper understanding of the workings of Google\u0027s algorithm and are often employed by Professional SEOs. Anyone can master advanced concepts with the right strategic guidance and real life application.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAccording to Griffin, Search engine optimization is the science of improving a website to increase its visibility when people search for products or services. The more visibility a website has on search engines, the more likely it is that brand captures business.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWebsite visibility is commonly measured by the placement -- or ranking -- of the site on search engine results pages (SERPs). And companies always vie for the first page, where they are most likely to garner the most attention.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing Google as an example, SERPs often feature ads at the top of the page. These are positions that businesses are willing to pay for to ensure placement on that first page. Following ads are the regular search listings, which marketers and search engines refer to as organic search results. The SEO process aims to increase a business\u0027s organic search results, driving organic search traffic to the site. This enables data marketers to distinguish between traffic that comes to a website from other channels -- such as paid search, social media, referrals and direct -- and the organic search traffic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrganic search traffic is usually higher-quality traffic because users are actively searching for a specific topic, product or service for which a site might rank. If a user finds that site through the search engine, it can lead to better brand engagement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow does SEO work? While there is a way to maximize results, it is almost impossible to fully manipulate search algorithms. Businesses often look to the shortest path toward ideal results with the least amount of effort, but SEO requires a lot of action and time. There is no SEO strategy where something can be changed today with the expectation of clear results tomorrow. SEO is a long-term project, with daily action and constant activity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch engines use bots to crawl all website pages, downloading and storing that information into a collection known as an index. This index is like a library and when someone searches for something in it, the search engine acts as the librarian. The search engine pulls and displays relevant information from the search query and shows users content related to what they were looking for. Search engine algorithms analyze webpages in the index to determine the order those pages should be displayed on the SERP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe learning objectives of SEO (Search Engine Optimization) encompass various skills and knowledge that enable individuals to effectively optimize websites and content for search engines.

It then progresses to the continuous version, the Real GA. The primary focus will be on the Genetic Algorithm, a highly regarded optimization algorithm in the literature. Subsequent sections will introduce well-known operation research problems such as transportation, hub location (HLP), quadratic assignment, and travelling salesman (TSP) problems, and demonstrate how to solve them using GA. This approach will equip you with a comprehensive framework to tackle any combinatorial optimization problems. Additionally, the course will cover two renowned methods for tuning GA\u0027s parameters: the Taguchi method and the Response Surface Methodology (RSM).
