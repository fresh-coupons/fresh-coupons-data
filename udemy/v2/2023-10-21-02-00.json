It talks and explains the networking basics which is much more helpful for the beginners who are new to the world and domain of networking. This OSPF Certification course of Routing Protocol OSPF builds a strong foundation for them to prepare for good level certifications like CCNA. You will be able to learn all the terminologies and key functionalities related to routing protocols. There is n number of routing protocols that are developed today but only very few have been adopted by the industry. In this course, all those concepts will be explained in detail and you can practice them at your ease. The broad areas to be covered are related to configurations, operations, and troubleshooting. Apart from that, there are a few use cases of two very popular Routing protocols that work on the principle of OSPF and have their level of advantages. This OSPF Certification Module describes how to connect and configure and operate Open Shortest Path First which was specifically designed for IP networks and therefore supports IP tagging and sub-netting of extremely derived information related to routing. It also allows the packet-based information and authentication to take place and also makes use of the multicast for Internet protocol when either sending or receiving any packet\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis course module named Routing Protocols RIP and EIGRP is quite similar to the one used above and is also responsible to teach you many basics and fundamental concepts such as those related to troubleshooting, operation, and configuration. The two most important routing protocols which will be explained in detail are the RIP also known as Routing information protocol and the other is EIGRP which is the abbreviated form for Extended interior Gateway protocol. In the RIP protocol, the oldest of the vectors for distance IP Routing protocols are still put to use and thereby getting various enhancements. There are currently two versions that exist for the RIP viz. RIPv1 and RIPv2. RIPv1 is also said to be the classful protocol which means that it is not classless whereas if you talk about the RIPv2, it is considered to be the classless support routing protocol and IPv6 is the one whose support is extended to RIPv2 with the next-gen RIP which is also termed as RIPng. EIGRP, on the other hand, is related to the Interior Gateway protocol as it is a proprietary protocol of the company CISCO. This protocol is occasionally described as the distance vector routing protocol which also acts and imitates like a link state-oriented protocol. Distance vector-based protocols share everything of which they are aware of. The only limitation they carry is that the amount of information shared is only among the neighbors which are directly or indirectly connected with each other. Link state-based protocols announce that the information present is only about the direction and not indirectly connected links. However, they are also responsible to share the routing protocol information among themselves in all the areas they deem fit among all the routes in their domain or area.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/cisco-ospf-hands-on-certification-training/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4844382_3644_3.jpg","duration":"10.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"10,051.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["The target audience for this course is anybody who has a keen interest in the field of digital communication and is also aware of how the basics of understanding the networks and other routing protocols and mechanisms such as OSPF Routing.

Moreover, it can be known to be the front-end based HTML framework which comprises many front end languages, and therefore it is built on top of the possibly best front end framework, AngularJS, and Cordova. It is an HTML5 based Mobile Application development framework which is targeted at building mobile-based hybrid apps. Ionic can be thought of as a front end UI framework that is used to handle the basic look and feel and the User interface based interactions that are required for the app to be compelling.

The default styling of the components can be easily overridden which can accommodate their designs. The JavaScript components extend the CSS component capabilities and also Javascript related functions and their capabilities to cover the mobile elements which cannot be only done with HTML and CSS. Other features include the ones related to Cordova plugins that offer the API related to the usage of the mobile-based native device functions with JavaScript code. The Ionic CLI is a NodeJS based utility which is powered by the various commands required for building, starting, running as well as emulating ionic applications.

It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E* Javascript Course Contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Introduction\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Array\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Variables\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Functions\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Objects\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Control Statements\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Cookies\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Loop statements\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Data Structures\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Error Handling\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Regular Expressions\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESee you inside the course\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-for-beginners-complete-course/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4200368_f71e_5.jpg","duration":"2 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"100,142.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["For Javascript  Programming Beginners","For People New to Javascript","For People Who want to learn Javascript Fundamentals and later Transition into Web Development"],"tags":["JavaScript"],"rating":{"count":1240,"averageValue":"4.2"},"instructors":[{"name":"PROPER DOT INSTITUTE","url":"/user/vivek-dahibhate-2/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.245223}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"2F184DB8F1F1C32A5CBE","originalPrice":"\u20B91,299","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/adobe-premiere-pro-cc-video-editing-for-beginners/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":3831056,"title":"Adobe Premiere Pro CC: Video Editing for Beginners","shortDescription":"Learn video editing in Adobe Premiere Pro CC with zero experience.","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThis course is a one-stop shop that has everything you need to become a confident editor inside Premiere Pro.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027ve taken a quick look at Adobe Premiere Pro and are completely overwhelmed by the features and have no clue how to start editing your first video, you have come to the right course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this complete guide to the Adobe Premiere Pro video editing course, you\u0027ll not only learn all of the editing tools available in Premiere Pro but also how to edit with the mindset of a professional editor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow to efficiently import and organize your media.

This heightened emphasis on career development places managers at the forefront of helping their team members chart their professional journeys. Coaching knowledge equips managers with the ability to provide guidance that is not only aligned with the organization\u0027s needs but also tailored to the aspirations of individual employees.  One of the key advantages of coaching in career development is its ability to facilitate self-awareness. Effective coaches help employees identify their strengths, weaknesses, interests, and values. Armed with this self-knowledge, employees can make informed career decisions that align with their passions and long-term goals.","2.2 The Manager as a Career Development Partner  Explore the responsibilities of middle and top managers in preparing and mentoring personal development plans for their team members. Learn how these plans can align with organizational objectives and create a win-win situation for both employees and the company.  Managers who actively engage in career development become indispensable partners in their employees\u0027 professional growth. They play a pivotal role in creating personalized development plans that leverage individual strengths and address areas needing improvement.  These development plans not only benefit the employees but also the organization. By aligning individual development goals with the company\u0027s strategic objectives, managers ensure that every team member\u0027s growth contributes to the overall success of the business.  Furthermore, coaching techniques are instrumental in fostering a growth mindset within teams. Managers can use coaching to encourage employees to embrace challenges, persist in the face of setbacks, and view failures as opportunities for learning and improvement. This mindset shift has a profound impact on team performance and innovation.","Coaching for Internal Education and Employee Development  3.1 The Role of Managers in Internal Education  Managers often bear the responsibility of nurturing a culture of learning within their teams and organizations. Explore how coaching methods can be instrumental in identifying and addressing skill gaps, fostering innovation, and supporting ongoing employee development.  In the rapidly evolving landscape of business, organizations that prioritize learning and development gain a competitive edge. Managers are at the forefront of this initiative, serving as the catalysts for continuous improvement and innovation within their teams.  Coaching methods play a pivotal role in identifying and addressing skill gaps. By regularly assessing the competencies of their team members, managers can tailor training and development programs to bridge these gaps effectively. This proactive approach not only enhances individual skills but also bolsters the organization\u0027s overall capabilities.","Moreover, coaching encourages a culture of innovation. Effective coaches inspire creativity and critical thinking in their teams. They challenge employees to question the status quo, explore new ideas, and experiment with novel approaches. In this way, managers act as innovation champions, driving progress and adaptability.","3.2 Coaching as a Tool for Employee Empowerment  Employee empowerment is a cornerstone of effective leadership. Coaching techniques provide managers with the tools to empower their team members by fostering a sense of ownership and autonomy in their roles.  One of the primary ways coaching empowers employees is by promoting self-directed learning. Instead of relying solely on formal training programs, employees learn to identify their development needs and take initiative in seeking resources and opportunities for growth. Managers who coach effectively encourage this proactive approach.  Furthermore, coaching cultivates a growth-oriented mindset among employees. When team members receive regular feedback, both positive and constructive, they become more receptive to continuous improvement. They view challenges as opportunities for growth and development, which ultimately leads to higher levels of engagement and performance.  By creating an environment where continuous learning is celebrated, managers inspire their teams to thrive in an ever-changing business landscape. This culture of learning becomes a strategic advantage for organizations, as it enables them to adapt quickly to new challenges and opportunities.","Coaching for Mental Health and Well-being  4.1 The Manager as a Trusted Support System  For many employees, especially those who live alone or lack a strong support network, a manager can become their most trusted confidant. Understand how coaching methods extend beyond professional development to support the mental health and well-being of team members.  The relationship between a manager and their team members extends beyond the confines of the workplace. In some cases, a manager may be the primary source of support for an employee, especially when they are facing personal challenges or seeking guidance related to their mental health and well-being.  Coaching methods are not limited to career development; they encompass the whole spectrum of an employee\u0027s life. Effective managers create an environment where team members feel comfortable discussing personal challenges and seeking guidance when needed. This trust and openness are essential for maintaining employee well-being.  In situations where employees are dealing with stress, anxiety, or other mental health issues, managers with coaching skills can provide valuable support. They can listen empathetically, offer guidance on stress management techniques, and help employees access appropriate resources for professional help when necessary.","4.2 Coaching for Life Questions and Personal Challenges  Life is filled with complexities, and employees often grapple with personal challenges that can affect their work performance and overall well-being. Managers who are skilled in coaching can offer valuable guidance during these times of need.  One area where coaching is particularly beneficial is work-life balance. In today\u0027s fast-paced world, employees often struggle to juggle their professional and personal responsibilities. Managers can use coaching techniques to help team members set boundaries, manage their time effectively, and achieve a healthier work-life balance.  Coaching also proves invaluable in navigating interpersonal relationships, both within and outside the workplace. Managers can offer insights into effective communication, conflict resolution, and building positive relationships, which can significantly impact an employee\u0027s overall quality of life.  In times of personal crisis or uncertainty, such as major life transitions or unexpected challenges, employees may turn to their managers for guidance. Managers trained in coaching can provide a supportive and non-judgmental space for employees to explore their feelings, identify potential solutions, and develop action plans to address these challenges.","In conclusion, coaching techniques have become indispensable in the modern workplace, particularly within the roles of managers and leaders. These skills not only drive career development and internal education but also play a crucial role in supporting the mental health and well-being of employees.  As we navigate an ever-changing professional landscape, organizations that recognize the importance of coaching will not only foster a culture of continuous improvement but also cultivate a loyal and motivated workforce. Managers who embrace coaching as a core aspect of their leadership style will not only elevate their own careers but also become catalysts for the success of their teams and organizations as a whole.  By understanding and implementing coaching techniques effectively, managers can truly transform the workplace into an environment where individuals thrive, careers flourish, and holistic well-being is nurtured."],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":31,"averageValue":"4.5"},"instructors":[{"name":"MTF Institute of Management, Technology and Finance","url":"/user/mtfinstitute/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.516129}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"5BFF6C19319DD2D8B6F1","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/talent-acquisition-hr-planning-recruiting-and-onboarding/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5613690,"title":"Talent Acquisition: HR Planning, Recruiting and Onboarding","shortDescription":"Talent Acquisition: Planning workforce, Recruiting and Onboarding, Talent Management, HR Management by MTF Institute","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWelcome to course: Talent Acquisition: HR Planning, Recruiting and Onboarding by MTF Institute\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eits the module of program \u0022Executive Diploma in Human Resources Management\u0022\u003Cbr\u003EYou may join that course separately, or join the full program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor full program we provide government certificate of professional education\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECourse provided by \u003Cstrong\u003EMTF Institute of Management, Technology and Finance\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMTF\u003C/strong\u003E is the global educational and research institute with HQ at Lisbon, Portugal, focused on higher \u0026amp; professional hybrid (on-campus and online) education at areas: Business \u0026amp; Administration, Science \u0026amp; Technology, Banking \u0026amp; Finance. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMTF R\u0026amp;D \u003C/strong\u003Ecenter focused on research activities at areas: Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Data Science, Big Data, WEB3, Blockchain, Cryptocurrency \u0026amp; Digital Assets, Metaverses, Digital Transformation, Fintech, Electronic Commerce, Internet of Things. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMTF\u003C/strong\u003E is the official partner of: IBM, Intel, Microsoft, member of the Portuguese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and resident of the incubator \u0022The Fintech House of Portugal\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMTF \u003C/strong\u003Eis present in 203 countries and has been chosen by more than 200,000 students.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECourse Author:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYuliya Vershilo, the Head of Compensation \u0026amp; Benefits in the Bank\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHuman Resource Management | Saint Petersburg State University of Finance and Economics, 2005\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPh.D. in Economics| Saint Petersburg State University of Finance and Economics, 2009\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInternational GRP Certification: Global Remuneration Professional |CBSD Thunderbird - World at Work, 2019\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGrading Program | CBSD Thunderbird - World at Work, 2021 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore than 19 years extensive experience in the field of HR management including:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETalent acquisition and selection.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECreating compelling Employee Value Propositions (EVPs),\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETraining and development,\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECompensation and benefits\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPeople analytics\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearning about Human Resources Management (HRM) is crucial for both companies and individuals seeking to build a successful career.
