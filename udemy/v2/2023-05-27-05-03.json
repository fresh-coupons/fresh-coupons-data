Psychologists study the connections that may be made between brain function and behavior, as well as the connections that can be made between behavior and the external world. They then put what they have learned to use in order to expand our understanding, so making the world a better place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Generally Accepted Scientific Procedure\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECuriosity is a characteristic that we all have by virtue of being human. When children are initially taught to ask questions, one of the first ones they are taught to ask is \u0022why?\u0022 Even if we are adults today, we will never stop being curious about things. Using empirical approaches, psychologists apply their universal interest to the process of data gathering and interpretation in research, with the ultimate objective of better grasping and addressing some of the most challenging challenges that contemporary society faces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is difficult, if not outright impossible, to think of a facet of life in which psychology does not play a part. There is no area of existence in which psychology does not play a role. The scientific method is something that psychologists employ. This process entails raising a question, offering an explanation for it, and then carrying out thorough experiments in the laboratory or out in the field to support the hypothesis. Psychologists use the information they\u0027ve gleaned from their studies and apply it to the creation of evidence-based practices that may assist in the resolution of problems and the improvement of people\u0027s lives.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ultimate effect of the discipline of psychology research is that it finds new and better ways that people may thrive in an environment that is becoming more complex while still surviving in that setting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Implementation of Scientific Principles\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are several subfields that fall under the umbrella of the subject of psychology. Psychologists do research that is both theoretical and applied, serve as consultants to various communities and organizations, diagnose and treat patients, and teach students who will go on to pursue careers in psychology as well as those who will go on to professions in other disciplines. In addition to judging one\u0027s character, they examine one\u0027s cerebral capabilities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are a significant number of psychologists who work in the medical profession as well. They assess not only the mental but also the behavioral functions, in addition to the health of the individual as a whole. Other subfields of psychology look at the dynamics of human interaction with one another and with technology, with the intention of improving these dynamics via their research.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe use of psychological research has the potential to minimize the financial toll that sickness has on governments and society by teaching people on how to make choices that are good to their own health and well-being. Students that have difficulty grasping new material are able to make better use of the improvements that have been made in educational assessment. It is helpful for educators to get an understanding of how children think, how they process information, and how they remember knowledge since this enables the creation of more effective educational techniques. The discipline of psychological science makes a contribution to the administration of justice by assisting legal authorities in gaining a better understanding of the minds of criminals, evidence, and the limitations of specific forms of testimony or evidence. This contribution is made possible thanks to the fact that psychological science is one of the fields that makes up the field of psychological science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe scientific study of the human mind and behavior is known as psychology.

This course teaches students how to create modern, interactive web pages using the Bootstrap framework and React JavaScript library. The course starts with an introduction into Bootstrap with a focus on its reputation in the development community as the number one choice for mobile-first front-end web frameworks. Bootstrap is a well documented collection of reusable code written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We start with exploring the foundations of Bootstrap, including embedding it into projects, and building out the basic Bootstrap page structure. From there we catapult into the infamous Bootstrap grid system, along with the commonly used three column web page layout. After the introductory topics, students learn to work with a number of components from typography, tables and image styling right up to wells, alerts, and buttons. As part of the course we demonstrate how to build out intricate navigation menus using dropdown, collapse, accordion, and pill menus. We will also cover form styling, carousels, modals, scrollspy and just about every other Bootstrap component that\u2019s instrumental to your journey as a front-end developer. The module concludes with a hands-on project, where students will use a Bootstrap theme to build a stunning web page from scratch.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn the second section of the course, we explore React. React, also known as React JS, is a powerful JavaScript library used for building custom, interactive user interfaces using UI components. Similar to Bootstrap, React is a well documented free and open source library. The project was founded by Meta and a network of independent developers. In this section, students learn how to use the React library through a series of hands-on projects. The React section of this course starts off with a hands-on project where you\u2019ll learn how to work with functional React components, props, Callback functions, OnClick Events, and the React State hook to build a fully functional calculator. From there we will dive into project number two, where you will build a connect-4 clone. Here we will cover more intermediate concepts including passing props, destructuring, passing arguments to click events, various styling methods, and handling callbacks. You will also learn about the React key property, React lifecycle events, and conditional rendering. By the end you will have built a complete multi and single player connect-4 game board with built-in AI capabilities. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn the final section of the course we further unleash the power of React by building out a complete e-commerce site with multiple product categories, a product showcase, shopping cart feature, and much more. Here, we introduce a number of integral new concepts including: JSON server, Fetch API, and installing React router. These essential building blocks will be used to render the product categories, style the product list, and configure the product details page. From there we dive into styled components, refactoring the shop layout, and exploring the concept of \u201Ccontext\u201D in React. In the final stages of the project students will configure the shopping cart basket, and the checkout feature. We will also implement a product search feature, followed by in-depth exercises on validating input forms in React.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAs you can see this course covers a tremendous bit of ground. Best of all it features Tim Maclachlan - a renowned senior full-stack developer with over 20 years of commercial development experience.

React, also known as React JS, is a powerful JavaScript library used for building custom, interactive user interfaces using UI components. Some of the most well known examples of organizations using React for their front-end include Netflix, Facebook, and Airbnb. Developed and maintained by Meta along with a community of independent developers, React remains free and open-source. React is a component based library built entirely on JavaScript, which makes it perfect for designing complex UI\u2019s. With React, developers can build encapsulated components that efficiently manage their own state and render UI updates specifically when data changes. For example, think of the automated content refresh feature you see on a twitter feed, or facebook like button. Here the state of the UI component changes on the page, without having to manually refresh when the data is updated. This is just one small, yet powerful feature of React.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThrough a complete hands-on project, this course will teach you all the fundamental principles of React that you must know to become a proficient React developer. We start right from the basics, including the tools needed to get started. From there we dive into JSX, functional components, props, callbacks, and various OnClick events. By this stage, the calculator will have a complete visual display, coupled with functional arithmetic operations. Students then move on to passing parameters in Callback functions, using the React State Hook, and debugging.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn addition to the hands-on React module, we also offer a comprehensive overview of JavaScript for those who need a refresher. Here we start with introducing students to the document object model (DOM) which defines the logical structure of HTML documents. From there we dive into JavaScript to demonstrate various methods in which DOM elements can be manipulated to add interactivity to static components. We start right from the basics, which includes JavaScript placement, and data output. From there we move on to variable declaration, arithmetic operations, operator precedence, data types, and objects. Once the foundations are covered, we move on to more complex operations using Arrays, Conditional Statements, JavaScript comparison operators, booleans and loops. Here students will learn to unleash the true power of JavaScript to render different outcomes based on user interaction. We will explore the use of functions to efficiently handle repetitive tasks and JavaScript events to handle output based on actions and occurrences. The section will conclude with a hands-on project where students will implement their knowledge to build a web based photo gallery and background color changer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/build-a-custom-e-commerce-site-in-react-javascript-basics/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4789922_401f.jpg","duration":"7 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"25,019.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Students interested in learning the Foundations of JavaScript","Students interested in learning the Foundations of ReactJS Library","Students interested in Building Interactive UI Components using React","Students interested in learning how to build a fully customized E-Commerce Site in React"],"tags":["JavaScript","React JS"],"rating":{"count":85,"averageValue":"4.4"},"instructors":[{"name":"YouAccel Training","url":"/user/youaccel/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.464286}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"YOUACCEL62900","originalPrice":"\u20B91,999","discountedPrice":"\u20B9449","expirationText":"5 hours","discountPercentage":78}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/write-article-content-for-seo-and-affiliate-marketing-course/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4831684,"title":"Write Article Content for SEO and Affiliate Marketing Course","shortDescription":"Affiliate Marketing Article Writing, SEO Article Writing, Google Adsense Article Writing, Blog and Freelance Article","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EDiscover the secrets of how to write article content that can rank on search engines, build affiliate revenue, and helps your company grow. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArticle writing or content writing now a days are highly demandable for affiliate marketing.

The course starts from the foundations, where we explore the Lightroom Classic CC interface, and setting up an image catalog.

From there, we dive into image file formats where students are introduced to a number of key terms relevant to both photography and image retouching. Students will learn the importance of file formats, color spaces, image resolution, pixel density, and the notorious RAW file. We also explore file handling options, interface preferences, identity plate setup and watermarking with both text and graphics.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOnce students are familiar with accessing the various interface components to perform a multitude of image sorting and organization tasks, we dive into one of the most powerful features of Lightroom: The Develop Module. Here students will start with exploring the Develop module interface along with the preset, and history panel. From there we will visit the collections panel before exploring a number of view options such as Loupe View and Compare view, for the ultimate in versatility when performing professional image enhancements. Students will learn to copy and paste image adjustments across a number of different images, while exploring a variety of image enhancement tools such as exposure correction, cloning, spot removal, red eye reduction, graduated filters, and white balance correction. In addition to simple adjustments, we also demonstrate how to perform intermediate enhancements using retouching techniques that are used in studios. This includes Tone curve adjustments, noise reduction, split toning, image sharpening, lens corrections, artistic vignetting and dehazing.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAs you can see this course covers a number of topics that are essential to anyone starting off in the digital image enhancement arena.

Here in this course, you will extensively learn how to utilize Leonardo AI to create amazing AI arts and images, and you will be guided step by step on how to make those arts and images to talk using free AI technology called D-ID which will enable us to create talking portraits by integrating audio files with images. In the introduction session, you learn the basic fundamentals about Leonardo AI and text to image generator technology especially understanding how it actually works, then, you will be shown some examples of images generated by Leonardo AI alongside with prompts that were used to create them, therefore, you will have some ideas about what prompt that you can write if you want to create images or arts similar to those. Afterward, you will learn several efficient techniques to write specific and descriptive prompts to give instruction to Leonardo AI to produce images or arts that you want, not only that but you will also be trained on how to use AI text prompt generators to help you find effective prompts to use. Then, you will be guided step by step to set up your account on Leonardo AI, explore all features in its dashboard and definitely generate images using Leonardo AI where we will be generating a variety of images while exploring all features available there. Thereafter, the course will be continued by taking all knowledge and skills that we\u2019ve learnt to another level, you will learn how to create a talking portrait using the image that you generated using Leonardo AI where you will utilize ChatGPT to generate sample content script which will be converted to audio using AI text to speech tool, then eventually you will learn how to integrate that audio with your image so your image or portrait can talk with hyper realistic motion in their upper and lower jaw. Lastly at the end of the course, I will share six business models that you can potentially start taking full advantage of Leonardo AI and since this technology is completely free, relatively you will have high profit margin business since there will be no upfront cost to use Leonardo AI\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, before getting into the course, we need to ask ourselves this question? What is the benefit of using Leonardo AI? Well, the answer is actually pretty obvious, it\u0027s one of the best AI text to image generator that exist, however, there is much more than that, due to the fact that Midjourney got rid of its free trial couple weeks ago, therefore, at the time I am creating this course it will cost you at least 10 dollars to use MidJourney. As the consequences, it is definitely not surprising at all to see many people are actively looking for free alternatives to Midjourney, hence, this is exactly when Leonardo AI comes into place as it has the same quality if not slightly better than Midjourney but even until today Leonardo AI still gives free access to its user with pretty generous limit which is 150 images per day for completely free.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow are things that you will learn in this course:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow AI text to image generator works from technological perspective\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow to write effective prompts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExploring all features on Leonardo AI dashboard\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETraining datasets for our own model on Leonardo AI\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExploring Fine Tuned Models available on Leonardo AI\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFull step by step tutorial on how to generate Image on Leonardo AI\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGenerating image using our own trained dataset models\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImage to image generation\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComplex prompt generation\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow to use AI canvas to combine images\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow to create AI talking portrait using D-ID\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/leonardo-ai-mastery-create-cool-ai-arts-talking-portraits/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5343630_362e.jpg","duration":"3 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"57.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["People who are interested to learn more about Leonardo AI","People who are interested to create hyper realistic talking portraits"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":0,"averageValue":"0.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"Christ Raharja","url":"/user/christ-raharja/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":0}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"4BD153C8F42951A6BA07","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"\u20B9449","expirationText":"5 hours","discountPercentage":44}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/negotiation-skill-process-tactics-strategy-and-style/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5334216,"title":"Negotiation Skill Process, Tactics, Strategy and Style","shortDescription":"Negotiation Process Framework on role based, action based, style based models with tactics, cases study and assessment","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDescription\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKnowing how to negotiate effectively, and with confidence, is \u003Cstrong\u003Ea skill that can make a huge difference to your career\u003C/strong\u003E, your day-to-day work life and your personal wellbeing.

Please note this course doesn\u0027t teach you to code and is only an introductory course.\u0026nbsp; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor businesses, cyber security is imperative to routine business activities. In supply chain and operations for instance, cyberthreats have risen to the forefront of supply chain security concerns. Cyberthreats refer to vulnerabilities in IT and software systems, like malware attacks, piracy, unauthorized ERP access and unintentional or maliciously injected backdoors in the purchased, open source or proprietary software used by organizations. Supply chain security here primarily involves minimizing risks from using software developed by another organization, and securing organizational data accessed by another organization in your supply chain. Organizations cannot take for granted that the software that they use or purchase is secure. Because close collaboration is often required between businesses, suppliers and resellers, computer networks may become intertwined or sensitive data shared. This can result in a breach of one organization affecting many. Instead of attacking the target directly, a cybercriminal may attack a weaker organization in the target\u0027s supply chain and use that access to meet their goals.

Information Technology and data needs and management is intrinsic to everyday live either as a student, a nurse, a nursery teacher, a bus driver or a director of a company. In our private, public and business lives we are either using a phone, a personal computer or a laptop to get tasks done, communicate with family or check our bank balance on the phone.  Devices used for these need to be secured against various computer viruses including spyware, adware, ransomware and keyloggers. Some simple and basic steps taken to support having basic security for devices to protect against some computer virus which can be extremely harmful and can impede your ability to get through a routine day.","For businesses, cyber security is imperative to routine business activities. In supply chain and operations for instance, cyberthreats have risen to the forefront of supply chain security concerns. Cyberthreats refer to vulnerabilities in IT and software systems, like malware attacks, piracy, unauthorized ERP access and unintentional or maliciously injected backdoors in the purchased, open source or proprietary software used by organizations.  Supply chain security here primarily involves minimizing risks from using software developed by another organization, and securing organizational data accessed by another organization in your supply chain. Organizations cannot take for granted that the software that they use or purchase is secure.  Because close collaboration is often required between businesses, suppliers and resellers, computer networks may become intertwined or sensitive data shared. This can result in a breach of one organization affecting many. Instead of attacking the target directly, a cybercriminal may attack a weaker organization in the target\u0027s supply chain and use that access to meet their goals.  Many are responding to recent supply chain attacks such as the SolarWinds attacks by, for example, reducing reliance on foreign suppliers and building primarily domestic supply chains.
