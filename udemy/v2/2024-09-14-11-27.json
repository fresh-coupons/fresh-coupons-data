And after all of this, we are simply going to process the payment with stripe and we are going to checkout and place orders finally. At the end of this whole process, we are going to give users the products that they paid for. This is the main function of this web app. Surely there is going to be an authentication system, a category system, and more on the users\u0027 side.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThere is also a cool and very practical admin panel, where we are going to handle general functions about our user\u0027s side.

It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E*\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E javascript course contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript introduction\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript array\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript variables\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript functions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript objects\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript control statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003Esection 4- learn PHP\u0026nbsp;programming language\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis section will learn the basic structure of a web application and how a web browser interacts with a web server.

Performance goals are specific targets or objectives that individuals or teams are expected to achieve within a given timeframe.

We will explore the significance of performance goals in the realm of human resources and the benefits they bring to both employees and organizations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Clarity and Focus: Performance goals provide clarity and direction to employees.

Motivation and Engagement: Well-defined performance goals have a motivational effect on employees. When employees have challenging yet attainable goals, they are more likely to feel engaged and motivated to perform at their best.

They can enhance job satisfaction and increase employee commitment to the organization.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Performance Evaluation: Performance goals serve as a basis for assessing employee performance. By setting clear objectives, managers can evaluate and measure the progress and achievements of employees.

Objective evaluation criteria linked to performance goals ensure fairness and transparency in the assessment process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Skill Development: Performance goals create opportunities for employees to develop and enhance their skills and competencies. By setting goals that require employees to stretch beyond their current capabilities, organizations can foster a culture of continuous learning and development. Employees are motivated to acquire new knowledge, acquire relevant training, and seek growth opportunities to meet or exceed their goals. This, in turn, benefits both the individual and the organization by building a skilled and capable workforce.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Alignment with Organizational Objectives: Performance goals play a crucial role in aligning individual and team efforts with the broader organizational objectives.

We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables.

The field of artificial intelligence (AI) has a long and rich history, dating back to the early days of computing. However, the field as we know it today was founded in 1956 at a conference at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire. This conference brought together the leading researchers in AI at the time, including Alan Turing, John McCarthy, and Marvin Minsky. The conference is credited with helping to define the field of AI and to set the agenda for future research.","Artificial Intelligence \u201CAI\u201D is a complex field that needs the ability of people from diverse disciplines to work together. As an example, manufacturing autonomous vehicles like self-driving cars requires the work of people from different fields, such as AI Researchers, Automotive Engineers, and Computer Vision Researchers.  AI Researchers develop algorithms that enable self-driving cars to perceive their surroundings, make decisions, and control their movements. Automotive Engineers develop the hardware and software systems that are needed to implement these algorithms, and Computer Vision Researchers develop new techniques for enabling self-driving cars to see and understand the world.","What is Machine Learning?  Machine Learning is a type of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that allows computers to learn from data without explicit programming. In other words, machine learning algorithms can recognize patterns and make predictions based on data, without getting a command. This enables computers to learn new tasks and improve their performance over time without human intervention.","Where is Machine Learning used?  Machine learning is in use by a wide range of applications, including email filtering, Social Media Personalization, Image Recognition, Speech Recognition, fraud detection, Text prediction, Product recommendation, medical diagnosis, Healthcare Personalization, Traffic Prediction.","Neural networks are a type of machine learning algorithm that is inspired by the structure and function of the human brain.  Neural networks can learn complex patterns from data.  Neural networks have been successfully used in areas such as natural language processing.","Deep Learning is a type of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers.  Each layer consists of multiple nodes that can perform diverse tasks. This allows deep learning models to learn more complex patterns from data.  Deep learning has been used to achieve significant results in a wide range of tasks, including image recognition, speech recognition, and machine translation."],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":333,"averageValue":"4.3"},"instructors":[{"name":"MTF Institute of Management, Technology and Finance","url":"/user/mtfinstitute/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.2083335}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"8E63342D340D197287CD","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"2 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/build-a-wordpress-blog-step-by-step/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":3840750,"title":"Build a WordPress Blog Website Step by Step","shortDescription":"Learn how to build a clean and professional WordPress blog from scratch","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EIn this course, I will show you step by step process of build a clean, modern, and professional WordPress blog from scratch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis course is \u003Cstrong\u003E100% beginner-friendly \u003C/strong\u003Eand you don\u2019t need any kind of prior WordPress website development knowledge or skills. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EOnly you need a computer and internet connection.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou will learn how to,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstall WordPress\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstall and Setup Plugins and Theme\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImport Demo Content and Customize Theme\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDesign User Friendly Blog Website\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECreate Pages and Write Articles\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMigrate WordPress Website to Live Server\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I will give some tips about blogging.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost importantly, You are going to use\u003Cstrong\u003E free plugins and a free theme\u003C/strong\u003E to build this awesome blog.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EYou don\u0027t need a web hosting package to follow this course.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will show you the way to install XAMMP on your local computer. if you don\u0027t have a domain name and server to host this WordPress blog. you can use a local server to build this website from scratch. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I will show you the way to migrate the whole website to the live server. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat do you achieve?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the end of this course, you will have a live blog website and you will be able to start your blogging business or sell blog websites to your clients.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EIf you didn\u0027t understand any part of this website building process, feel free to contact me.
