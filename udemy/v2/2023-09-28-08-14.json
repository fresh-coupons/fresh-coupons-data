Products look better than ever, interfaces feel intuitive, and companies are hiring designers at an increasing rate. But, the designer\u2019s role has been changing over the last few years. It\u2019s no longer enough to iterate and understand your user, instead in today\u2019s world, designers should be able to do both \u2013 identify problems and build solutions, which will increase their worth by at least 10 times for any company.

for entering financial data into QuickBooks for financial planning and year-end tax preparation. \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe bookkeeping system we discuss will also describe the relationship between the bookkeeper, the business, and the year-end tax and financial statement preparers. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe will outline a cash basis bookkeeping system using QuickBooks, a system that will enter most transactions directly into the check register. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe course will discuss the responsibilities of a bookkeeper and the responsibilities of the business when a bookkeeping engagement in entered into.\u00A0 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe will work through a sample bookkeeping project in QuickBooks including the setting up of a new QuickBooks company file. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe course will practice entering data into the QuickBooks register directly from a bank statement. We will provide practice bank statements to use with the project as well as step by step instructional videos. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs we enter data directly into the check register from the bank statement, we will compare and contrast the cash basis system we are using to a full accounting cycle system. We will also review the financial statements periodically to see how QuickBooks is using the data to make reports. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter entering data into the QuickBooks check register from the bank statement, we will perform bank reconciliations. As we perform bank reconciliations, we will discuss what a bank reconciliation is and the benefits a bank reconciliation provides. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe course will then discuss options for entering specific accounting data into QuickBooks including payroll, equipment, loan payments, insurance, credit card payments, and invoices. We will provide practice QuickBooks files for different options related to the items listed above and explore the pros and cons of each option. The bookkeeping options will help tailor our system to our specific bookkeeping needs. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs we enter accounting data into the system we will discuss common questions we will have when entering the first few months of data and how to write down these questions, move forward with data input, and organize the financial data so that we can quickly go back to it once our client questions are answered. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis course will discuss, print, and export month end and year end reports, reports a bookkeeper may provide to clients monthly and reports the business will need at year-end for tax preparation. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe will discuss year-end adjusting entries. The bookkeeping system we propose will depend on an outside accounting firm, tax preparer, or CPA firm to help with the year-end adjusting entries. As bookkeepers we want to be aware of the adjusting entry process so we can work with any year-end accounting firm, tax preparer, or CPA firm. We will enter common adjusting entries into an adjusting entry Excel worksheet and into Quickbooks. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe course will then compare and contrast our different bookkeeping methods and show how those different bookkeeping decisions reconcile to the same numbers after the adjusting entry process. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, we will discuss whether or not to enter the year-end adjusting entries into our QuickBooks bookkeeping system and different options to do so. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to the instructional videos, this course will include downloadable\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u2022\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 QuickBooks Backup files\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u2022\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 Excel practice files\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u2022\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 Downloadable PDF Files\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe QuickBooks backup files are a great tool that allows us to jump ahead in the material or to rework material if we choose. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExcel practice files will be preformatted and will generally have at least two tabs, one tab with the completed work and a second tab with a preformatted worksheet we can fill in as we watch the instructional videos.\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWho will we be learning from?\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou will be learning from somebody who has technical experience in accounting concepts and in accounting software like QuickBooks, as well as experience teaching and putting together curriculum.\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou will be learning from somebody who is a:\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u2022\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 CPA \u2013 Certified Public Accountant\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u2022\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 CGMA \u2013 Chartered Global Management Accountant\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u2022\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 Master of Science in Taxation\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u2022\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 CPS \u2013 Certifies Post-Secondary Instructor\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u2022\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 Curriculum Development Export\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a practicing CPA the instructor has worked with many technical accounting issues and helped work through them and discuss them with clients of all levels.\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a CPA and professor, the instructor has taught many accounting classes and worked with many students in the fields of accounting, business, and business applications.\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe instructor also has a lot of experience designing courses and learning how students learn best and how to help students achieve their objectives.

According to Stackoverflow JavaScript is the most popular programming language used by professional developers today. Even back-end developers choose JavaScript more often than not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E 2) It\u2019s in your browser\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJavaScript is, without question, the default language of the internet. You need to look no further than your browser for proof since JavaScript was most likely used to develop it. Since browsers are a necessary part of any user\u2019s online experience, it\u2019s easy to see why JavaScript is so significant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E3) JavaScript also exists outside of the internet\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJavaScript has many uses that go beyond its traditional internet roles. It powers smart televisions, works with the internet of things (IoT), creates native apps for iOS and Android, and builds cross-platform desktop apps, to name a few.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E4) JavaScript is Ideal for Newbies\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince it\u2019s already installed on every web browser today, JavaScript spares the rookies from the chore of setting up a development environment. Newcomers can just jump in and start coding. It\u2019s one of the most accessible entries into coding available, a value-add for beginners. There is also a large online community that offers support and advice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, JavaScript is an excellent tool for beginning programmers who want to expand their skill set into other languages. JavaScript supports valuable skills such as object-oriented, functional, and imperative styles of programming. Beginner developers, in turn, can apply these skills to any new language they want to learn, like Python, Java, or C\u002B\u002B.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E5) JavaScript is Easy to Learn\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot only is it a natural language to use, but JavaScript is also easy to pick up.

Do you want to do user-side (front-end) coding? You can do it in conjunction with Angular. Are you more interested in the server-side (back-end)? Bring Node.js into the mix and you can do that, too!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also create desktop, mobile, and web apps with Electron, React Native, and React.

I am Sam Rao and welcome to my C4-D fundamentals course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis course takes you through, step by step into the fine art of becoming a proficient 3D animator. The software of choice is Cinema 4D, a software becoming increasingly popular in the Broadcast and Motion Graphics industry. Each and every topic is generously interspersed with explanatory graphics which complement the material being taught. Care has been taken that keyboard shortcuts are highlighted where they have been used, and also there is a brief recap of the start of each new session of what was covered earlier. The course consists of primarily video lectures, as this was deemed the format most easily absorbed by new learners. The course does not need advanced knowledge of computers or knowledge of 2D animation or even animation principles. Each new lecture may contain some portions of the earlier lecture, so it is advised that the lectures or sessions be followed in sequence. And some topics have projects also include, but the introductory series does not. The first few chapters deal with topics that are relevant to modeling while the following series covers materials, lighting, render settings and Animation.\u0026nbsp; I hope you enjoy this relevant and practical course and do the projects that are given at the end of some chapters of this exciting and industry relevant course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will be doing all the other parts of Cinema 4D, namely lighting, Materials, Textures, Rendering and animation in later modules.
