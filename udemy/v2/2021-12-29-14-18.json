Despite the fact that the concept of neuroplasticity is quite new, it is one of the most important discoveries in neuroscience. The fact is that neural networks are not fixed, but occurring and disappearing dynamically throughout our whole life, depending on experiences. While we repeatedly practice one activity such as a sequence of movements or a mathematical problem, neuronal circuits are being formed, leading to better ability to perform the practiced task with less waste of energy. Once we stop practicing a certain activity, the brain will redirect these neuronal circuits by a much known \u0027use it or lose it\u2019 principle.

It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E* Javascript Course Contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Introduction\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Array\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Variables\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Functions\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Objects\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Control Statements\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Cookies\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Loop statements\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Data Structures\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Error Handling\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Regular Expressions\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESee you inside the course\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E","language":"\u0130ngilizce","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-for-beginners-complete-course/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4200368_f71e_5.jpg","duration":"2 saat","enrolledStudentsCount":"35.129 \u00F6\u011Frenci","lastUpdated":"Son g\u00FCncelleme tarihi: 7/2021","targetAudiences":["For Javascript  Programming Beginners","For People New to Javascript","For People Who want to learn Javascript Fundamentals and later Transition into Web Development"],"tags":["BT ve Yaz\u0131l\u0131m","BT Sertifikalar\u0131","JavaScript"],"rating":{"count":219,"averageValue":"4.3"},"instructors":[{"name":"PROPER DOT INSTITUTE","url":"/user/vivek-dahibhate-2/","totalNumberOfStudents":108954,"totalNumberOfReviews":915,"averageRating":4.355135637138263}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"BC9C0DFD19D0CD9E7B2E","originalPrice":"5.440\u00A0\u20B9","discountedPrice":"380\u00A0\u20B9","expirationText":"2 g\u00FCn","discountPercentage":93}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/facebook-marketing-course-for-beginners/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4339022,"title":"Facebook Marketing 2022.
