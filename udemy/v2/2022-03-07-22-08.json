One day, he found a very beautiful parakeet and, enchanted by it, brought it home. He kept the parakeet in a cage and enjoyed looking at it everyday, as the poor parakeet looked miserable and wanted to fly back to its home. Everyday, the parakeet sang, \u0022Rama, Rama, Rama, Rama, Rama, Rama, Rama\u2026.\u0022 and so on. The boy laughed with pleasure every time the parakeet sang this, delighted by the sweet voice of the small bird. The boy kept this parakeet for 12 days before feeling sympathy for it, and letting it go. The parakeet flew away in happiness, delighted to be with its family again. Soon, the boy grew into adulthood, married, led a happy house holder life, and died in old age, satisfied with his life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis boy got reborn as Kancherla Gopanna in 1620 C.E. in the village of Nelakondapalli in Northern Andhra Pradesh, the only son to a simple Brahmin family. His father was Linganna Murthy and his mother was Kamamba.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKancherla Gopanna\u0027s uncle, Akkanna, was the administrative head in the court of \u003Cem\u003EQutub Shahi Sultan Abul Hassan Tana Shah\u003C/em\u003E, the Mughal ruler of the area. Akkanna, due to his influence in the King\u0027s court, secured Kancharla Gopanna a job as Tahsildar (revenue collector) of Palvoncha Paragana. Along with his wife Kamala, who was carrying at the time, Kancherla Gopanna went to Palvoncha Paragana, and did his official duties honestly and kindly. The people of Palvoncha Paragana loved and respected Kancharla Gopanna, and listened to anything he said. It was around this time that Kancherla Gopanna became an ardent devotee to Lord Ramachandra, and composed many kritis (Carnatic Music songs) on him. Some famous compositions among many others are \u003Cem\u003EAnta Ramamayam\u003C/em\u003E and \u003Cem\u003EBhadra Shaila Raja Mandira\u003C/em\u003E. Also, a son was born to Kancherla Gopanna and his wife Kamala. They named him Raghu Rama.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Mughal King Tana Shah had a wife named Sitara, who disliked Kancherla Gopanna, because she had hoped the job of Tahsildar would go to her own nephew. Queen Sitara one day sent some of her trusted men to kill Kancherla Gopanna at the dead of night, so that once he died, her nephew could ascend the post. One night, when Kancherla Gopanna was walking home through a forest after collecting revenue from the people, Sitara\u0027s people jumped out from behind some trees and attacked Kancherla Gopanna, who prayed to Lord Rama to save him. Lord Rama, pleased with the humble devotion of Kancherla Gopanna, came in the farm of a fierce tiger and scared away Sitara\u0027s men. Kancherla Gopanna, with tears of happiness in his eyes, knew that the tiger was Lord Rama, and composed a \u003Cem\u003Ekriti\u003C/em\u003E then and there, in which he asked Rama that, \u0022now that you gave your darshan, I want the darshan of Sitamma talli.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne day, a few years later, Kancherla Gopanna went to Bhadrachalam for a fair, and also to see the holy site of the parnasala where Rama stayed with Sita and Lakshmana for some time during his exile. Near Bhadrachalam, there was also another site where Shabari had lived before getting moksha from Lord Rama. However, Kancherla Gopanna was very disappointed when he saw the temple of Lord Rama there, which held lots of significance for Telugu people, because that temple was the place where Potana had received darshan from Rama to write the Bhagavatham. The temple was very dilapidated, and unkempt. No priests did puja in it, and it was utterly neglected by the people of Bhadrachalam.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKancherla Gopanna decided to raise funds and reconstruct the temple himself, with the help of his wife, son, and the people. Everyone donated something of theirs, like gold necklaces, bangles, rings, gold coins, etc, for the reconstruction of the temple, and along with Kancherla Gopanna\u0027s wealth, they made a pretty hefty sum of money. It was during this time that Shri Rama, very pleased with Kancherla Gopanna, appeared to him in a dream and gave him the name of Ramadasu (servant of Lord Rama). From there on, Kancherla Gopanna was known as Ramadasu, one of the great devotees of Lord Rama.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"Ingl\u00EAs","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-carnatic-flute-ramadasu-keerthanas-volume-4/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4509030_0117.jpg","duration":"31 total mins","enrolledStudentsCount":"337 alunos","lastUpdated":"\u00DAltima atualiza\u00E7\u00E3o em 2/2022","targetAudiences":["Those who are curious to learn and practice the Carnatic Music form"],"tags":["M\u00FAsica","Instrumentos","Flauta"],"rating":null,"instructors":[{"name":"Krishna Mohan Bhagavatula","url":"/user/krishna-mohan-bhagavatula/","totalNumberOfStudents":21582,"totalNumberOfReviews":165,"averageRating":4.806434605479452}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"E6CBCA38B598B03CFFD6","originalPrice":"4.800\u00A0INR","discountedPrice":"Gratuit","expirationText":"2 zile","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/tibco-spotfire-interview-technical-questions-answered-with-explanation/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":3829756,"title":"Spotfire Interview Tech Questions Answered with Explanation","shortDescription":"Answers with Detail Explanation to Actual Spotfire Interview Questions, beneficial for Beginners and Experienced alike.","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EGet that dream Business Intelligence Job in Spotfire..!\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to this course on \u003Cstrong\u003ESpotfire Technical interview Questions and Answers \u003C/strong\u003Ewhere you are going to \u003Cstrong\u003Eexcel\u003C/strong\u003E the \u003Cstrong\u003ESpotfire Technical job interview.

It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E*\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E javascript course contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript introduction\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript array\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript variables\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript functions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript objects\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript control statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript cookies\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript loop statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript data structures\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript error handling\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript regular expressions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003Esection 3- learn PHP\u0026nbsp;programming language\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this section, we will learn the basic structure of a web application, and how a web browser interacts with a web server.
