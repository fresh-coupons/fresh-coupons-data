DNA template is denatured to single strands.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. DNA primer (with 3\u2019 end near sequence of interest) is annealed to \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe template DNA and extended with DNA polymerase.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Four reactions are set up, each containing:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. DNA template\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Primer annealed to template DNA\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. DNA polymerase\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. dNTPS (dATP, dTTP, dCTP, and dGTP)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Next, a different radio-labeled dideoxynucleotide (ddATP, ddTTP, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EddCTP, or ddGTP) is added to each of the four reaction tubes at \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1/100th the concentration of normal dNTPs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. ddNTPs possess a 3\u2019-H instead of 3\u2019-OH, compete in the reaction with \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enormal dNTPS, and produce no phosphodiester bond.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Whenever the radio-labeled ddNTPs are incorporated in the chain, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDNA synthesis terminates.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Each of the four reaction mixtures produces a population of DNA \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emolecules with DNA chains terminating at all possible positions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. Extension products in each of the four reaction mixutes\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ealso end with a different radio-labeled ddNTP\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(depending on the base).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9. Next, each reaction mixture is electrophoresed in a \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eseparate lane (4 lanes) at high voltage on a \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Epolyacrylamide gel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10.Pattern of bands in each of the four lanes is visualized \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eon X-ray film.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E11.Location of \u201Cbands\u201D in each of the four lanes indicate \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe size of the fragment terminating with a respective \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eradio-labeled ddNTP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E12.DNA sequence is deduced from the pattern of bands in \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe 4 lanes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAutomated Dye-Terminator DNA Sequencing:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

Automated DNA sequencing employs the same general \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eprocedure, but uses ddNTPs labeled with fluorescent dyes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Combine 4 dyes in one reaction tube and electrophores in \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eone lane on a polyacrylamide gel or capillary containing \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Epolyacrylamide.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. UV laser detects dyes and reads the sequence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Sequence data is displayed as colored peaks \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(chromatograms) that correspond to the position of each \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enucleotide in the sequence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6.
