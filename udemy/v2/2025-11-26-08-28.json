You\u0027ll embark on an exciting journey where you\u0027ll learn how to harness the power of Python to manipulate MAC addresses, develop network scanners, execute Man-in-the-Middle attacks, intercept network traffic, create your own pentesting RAT (Remote Access Trojan) malware, and much more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe course begins by laying a solid foundation in Python fundamentals. Even if you\u0027re new to programming, you\u0027ll quickly grasp key concepts and techniques that are essential for ethical hacking. From there, you\u0027ll dive into the world of network security and learn how to manipulate MAC addresses using the terminal, as well as develop your own Python program to change MAC addresses dynamically. This skill is invaluable for concealing your identity and enhancing your hacking capabilities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext, you\u0027ll explore the intricacies of ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) and the ARP table.

In this course, you\u0027ll not only understand how these attacks work in reality, but also plan and execute your own MiTM program using Python. You\u0027ll learn how to spoof routers and targets simultaneously, fixing any encountered problems along the way.
