Modern chatbots are typically online and use generative artificial intelligence systems that are capable of maintaining a conversation with a user in natural language and simulating the way a human would behave as a conversational partner. Such chatbots often use deep learning and natural language processing, but simpler chatbots have existed for decades.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"Hindi","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/chatbot-development/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/6105187_d55c_4.jpg","duration":"2 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"3,953.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Beginner","Fresher","Corporate employee training"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":18,"averageValue":"4.7"},"instructors":[{"name":"Ganesh Kadam","url":"/user/ganesh-kadam-20/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.5}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"A4E7CF997D0280993401","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"\u20B9399","expirationText":"\uD83E\uDD37\u200D\u2640","discountPercentage":50}}},"freeCourses":{}}
