It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E* Javascript Course Contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Introduction\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Array\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Variables\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Functions\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Objects\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Control Statements\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Cookies\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Loop statements\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Data Structures\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Error Handling\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Regular Expressions\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESee you inside the course\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThank you see you inside the course\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/css-and-javascript-complete-course-for-beginners/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4282170_1ea0.jpg","duration":"4 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"116,924.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["For People New to CSS And JavaScript","For People Who want to learn CSS And JavaScript Fundamentals and later Transition into Web Designing","For People New to Web Designing"],"tags":["CSS","JavaScript"],"rating":{"count":1667,"averageValue":"4.4"},"instructors":[{"name":"PROPER DOT INSTITUTE","url":"/user/vivek-dahibhate-2/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.320359}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"6AE74EDD4C962CA83DDA","originalPrice":"\u20B91,799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/living-as-old-as-your-grandfather/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":2613754,"title":"Life extension and Wellbeing - improve your life!","shortDescription":"Anti aging strategies with workbooks.

This Microcontroller is called\u0026nbsp;DigiSpark.\u0026nbsp;It is a microcontroller\u0026nbsp;based on the Attiny85 development board. It is similar to Arduino but smaller and more powerful in terms of\u0026nbsp;hacking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstalling backdoors, exfiltrating documents, or capturing credentials is incredibly easy with a seemingly innocent USB drive called the USB\u0026nbsp; Rubber Ducky. An Expert hacker with a few minutes, photographic memory,\u0026nbsp; and perfect typing accuracy can use a few well-crafted keystrokes to hack virtually anything they have physical access to. However, the proper hardware can do the same thing every time on demand without fail.\u0026nbsp; That\u2019s where the Rubber Ducky and other Human Interface Devices (HID)\u0026nbsp; come into play. They inject keystrokes at superhuman speeds, violating computers\u0027 inherent trust in humans by posing as a keyboard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this class, we\u2019ll learn more about what HID attacks are, how they work,\u0026nbsp; the social engineering that can be involved in their deployment, and how to use them in your Pen-testing engagements. Keyboards announce themselves to computers as HID devices and are in turn automatically recognized and accepted. We\u0027ll program a microcontroller in Arduino to take advantage of this by acting as an HID device. We can then create scripts that run when the device is plugged into a target computer. All at only a fraction of the cost of the more well-branded USB Rubber\u0026nbsp; Ducky!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStudents will learn to use a low-cost Digispark to program their payloads for use in Ethical Hacking and Penetration testing. We\u0027ll go over creating more advanced loads, including tracking payloads that run in the background, as well as Rickroll payloads that can be used with permission from friends and family to demonstrate how HID attacks work. Additionally, students learn to automate nearly anything on an unattended device which can be extremely useful when you need to run the same commands on a series of computers.\u0026nbsp; That\u2019s how the Original USB Ruber Ducky was invented. Hak5 founder\u0026nbsp; Darren Kitchen, while working as a sysadmin, got tired of typing the same commands to fix printers and network shares, again and again, and the device evolved out of laziness.

The sales person must reassure the client that by buying that upmarket product, they are getting better features and benefits that will enhance their experience with the product they just bought. The intelligent sales person is always pointing out how this is good for the customer. This process will increase the total value of the transaction for the seller, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECross-selling is when a complimentary product is suggested to go along with the main purchase. For example, if a customer buys a smart phone, the sales person might suggest a protective case to go along with the phone. The idea is to give the customer peace of mind that their newly purchased product will be protected if the phone is dropped.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDown-selling is about suggesting a lower-priced option when a customer is concerned about the cost of the higher-priced item.
