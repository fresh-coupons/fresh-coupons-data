The real estate business encompasses all activities related to the buying, selling, renting, development, and management of land and buildings. This includes:  Residential Real Estate: Homes, apartments, condominiums, and other housing types.  Commercial Real Estate: Office buildings, retail spaces, warehouses, industrial properties, hotels, and more.  Land: Undeveloped land, agricultural land, and properties with development potential.  Real Estate Brokerage: Facilitating transactions between buyers and sellers.  Real Estate Development: Transforming land into usable properties.  Property Management: Overseeing the operations of rental properties.","Why is Learning About the Real Estate Business Important for Companies and Managers?  Real estate knowledge has significant implications for businesses, regardless of their core industry:  Cost Management: Real estate is often a company\u0027s second-largest expense after personnel costs. Understanding lease negotiations, property values, and market trends is crucial for making informed financial decisions.  Business Expansion: When a company intends to grow, strategic real estate decisions play a vital role. Site selection, facility planning, and understanding local land-use regulations are essential for successfully scaling operations.  Asset Optimization: Companies often own more real estate than they need. Learning about sale-leaseback options or subleasing excess space can unlock hidden capital and improve a company\u0027s bottom line.

So after this course, you can feel comfortable working with PHP. The course is highly dedicated to those people who want to get into PHP and start with it in no time. We will start working with the basic fundamentals of PHP like \u0022echo statements\u0022, \u0022comments\u0022 and stuff like that up to the intermediate level and then to the advanced parts like \u0022super globals\u0022, \u0022date and time\u0022 and so on.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe other part of the course is very simple yet practical crucial and useful and that is \u0022building a todolist with PHP and MySQL\u0022. and in it, I am going to walk you through the process of building this little app, so you can apply what you have learned. I am also going to show you how to think and analyze in terms of code and this will unlock your potential as a programmer and allow you to get out of the tutorial hell which kills every programmer\u0027s possibility of getting ahead.\u003Cbr\u003EThe course also contains material such as code snippets and source codes for the project applied and quizzes and so on. if you are ready to take this journey with me, then go ahead and take this course.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-php-for-beginners-php-crash-course-2021/","imageUri":"https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/3755422_4493_3.jpg","duration":"5.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"149,442.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Anyone who is interested in learning PHP","Anyone who is curious about MySQL and PDO"],"tags":["PHP"],"rating":{"count":1366,"averageValue":"4.2"},"instructors":[{"name":"Web Coding","url":"/user/bdb27e95-65f5-415a-956b-65f62ba4bfc3/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.17}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"PHPCOURSE108","originalPrice":"\u20B92,699","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/quantitysurveyingwithhablas/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4018444,"title":"\u062D\u0635\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0645\u064A\u0627\u062A \u0644\u0644\u0627\u0639\u0645\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0639\u062A\u064A\u0627\u062F\u064A\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u0645\u0627\u0631\u064A\u0629","shortDescription":"\u062F\u0648\u0631\u0629 \u062A\u0639\u0644\u0645 \u062D\u0635\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0645\u064A\u0627\u062A \u0644\u0644\u0623\u0639\u0645\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0639\u062A\u064A\u0627\u062F\u064A\u0629 \u0648\u0623\u0639\u0645\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u062A\u0634\u0637\u064A\u0628\u0627\u062A \u0641\u064A \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0634\u0631\u0648\u0639\u0627\u062A \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0646\u0634\u0627\u0626\u064A\u0629","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u062F\u0648\u0631\u0629 \u062A\u0639\u0644\u0645 \u062D\u0635\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0645\u064A\u0627\u062A \u0644\u0644\u0623\u0639\u0645\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0639\u062A\u064A\u0627\u062F\u064A\u0629 \u0648\u0623\u0639\u0645\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u062A\u0634\u0637\u064A\u0628\u0627\u062A \u0641\u064A \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0634\u0631\u0648\u0639\u0627\u062A \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0646\u0634\u0627\u0626\u064A\u0629\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u062D\u0635\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0645\u064A\u0627\u062A \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0639\u0645\u0627\u0644\u0026nbsp;
