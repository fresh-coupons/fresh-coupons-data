It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the

And then we are going to build a full authentication system from scratch. While building this system I am going to introduce you to hashing and dehashing passwords. Right after this, we will allow users to book tables and I will add lots of validation points in this area of the course to assure the quality of this function. And then, we are going to build general and cool features inside our own app. It\u0027s going to be mainly on selecting and placing data. After this part, We are going to build a cart system where we will allow users to add drinks to the cart so they can order them online. And then naturally to the checkout page and after this, I am going to show you how to pay with PayPal easily and nicely. Since this part is done we will only have some general parts on the user end like grabbing bookings and orders for every user, allowing users to write reviews, and so on. Also, there is a part where we will work with the menu to display more products to the users. And then to the admin panel which is going to be really simple yet very functional and you are going to learn a lot building it.
