Understand the basic skills required to become cost estimator\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Define the different classes of cost estimates; This is critical as it help to pick the right estimating methodology and provide the expected accuracy\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Identify the main players in a building project\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Distinguish building systems; You need to know them to be able to cost them\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Explain the main types of project delivery methods. This would affect your cost estimate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8.
