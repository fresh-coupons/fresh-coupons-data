It assumes that you\u0027re new to the language, so it gets you started with basic functionality such as creating functions, creating variables, and calling these lines of code from your standard HTML pages. It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E*\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E javascript course contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript introduction\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript array\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript variables\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript functions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript objects\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript control statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript cookies\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript loop statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript data structures\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript error handling\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript regular expressions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003Esection 2- learn PHP\u0026nbsp;programming language\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis section will learn the basic structure of a web application and how a web browser interacts with a web server.

This is a comprehensive data analysis course where you will be guided step by step on how to perform complex data analysis and visualisation on inflation data using R programming language. This course is a perfect combination of macroeconomics and statistics as you will learn all things about inflation from both perspectives. In the introduction session, you will learn basic fundamentals of R programming language, such as getting to know its use cases and features that R has but Python does not have. Then, continue by learning the basic fundamentals of macroeconomics and inflation, using case study examples to understand inflation better as well as getting to know factors that cause inflation. Afterward, you will also learn how to calculate inflation rate and interest rate as well as understanding the relationship between both of them, especially why in most cases raising the interest rate can help to lower the inflation rate. Before starting the project, you will be guided step by step on how to set up all necessary tools, such as installing R programming language and R Studio which is the IDE that will be used in our project. Meanwhile, for the data source, we are going to get our datasets from Kaggle which is one of the largest data science learning platforms that has a lot of datasets that can be downloaded for free. In the project section, you are going to be conducting analysis and visualisation on two different datasets from Kaggle. At the end of the project, you are also going to learn how to deliver data insights and summaries which highlight all your findings during the project. Last but not least, at the end of the course, we will also go over several solutions that can be implemented to lower inflation rate like effective monetary policy, cutting of unnecessary government spending, and fiscal responsibility.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, before getting into the course, we need to ask ourselves these questions. Why should we learn about inflation? Why should we analyze inflation data using the R programming language? Well, let me ask you this question first, have you ever asked yourself, why a cup of coffee that cost two dollars five years ago but now the same product with the same quality costs three dollars? Or maybe why a gaming desk cost you a hundred dollars three years ago but today the same product from the same brand costs you two hundred dollars. Well, those are a few examples of inflation in real life where your cash today is no longer as valuable as it used to be a couple years ago and you might be wondering why? Well inflation reduces a currency\u2019s purchasing power as what we discussed in the previous example where two dollars could buy you a cup of coffee five years ago but today you need three dollars. There are many factors out there that can potentially cause inflation however the most common factor is the oversupply of cash where there is more cash in the circulation than the actual demand. Let me give you an example, let\u2019s say there is an island with population of a thousand people and there are only a hundred coins in the circulation, obviously in this case, the coin is very valuable as they are a thousand people who want to get those coins but there are only a hundred coins available but what if I told you the island\u2019s ministry of treasury decided to create nine hundred more coins, so now there are a thousand coins in the circulation, obviously, now the value of one coin is definitely not as valuable as it used to be. Hence, what we are going to do in this course is to use data to investigate inflation patterns as well as forecast the inflation rate in the future based on the historical data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow are things that you can expect to learn from the course:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn basic fundamentals of macroeconomics and inflation, such as getting to know factors that cause inflation and example of inflation in real life\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn basic fundamentals of R programming language and getting to know its use cases\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to calculate inflation and interest rate\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how high interest impacts the market from several perspectives, such as cost of borrowing, consumer spending, real estate market and stock market\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to find and download datasets from Kaggle\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to upload and import data to RStudio Cloud\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to clean data and remove all NA values from dataset using R\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to find countries with highest inflation rate using R\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to visualize inflation data for a specific country using scatter plot in R\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInvestigate inflation trend in 2008 economic crisis using R\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to compare inflation between two countries using R\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to forecast future inflation using R\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to find correlation between inflation and interest rate, then, visualise the correlation using scatter plot\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to find correlation between inflation and unemployment rate, then, visualise the correlation using scatter plot\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn several policies that can be implemented to lower inflation rate\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/macroeconomic-analysis-investigating-inflation-trend-with-r/","imageUri":"https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5512022_0cb4_2.jpg","duration":"3.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"2,762.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["People who are interested in macroeconomics particularly analysing inflation trend","People who are interested in data analysis and visualisation using R","People who are interested in investment and want to know how inflation impacts the market"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":3,"averageValue":"5.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"Christ Raharja","url":"/user/christ-raharja/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":5}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"989BB5FAB38B07384A64","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"3 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/color-grading-and-video-editing-with-davinci-resolve/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":2492980,"title":"Color Grading and Video Editing with Davinci Resolve 18","shortDescription":"Learn Video Editing in DaVinci Resolve 18 with Color Correction \u0026 Color Grading \u0026 Visual Effects","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EDaVinci Resolve 18\u0026nbsp; Beginners Course \u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDaVinci Resolve 18 is a free professional video editing application used by professionals and amateurs.
