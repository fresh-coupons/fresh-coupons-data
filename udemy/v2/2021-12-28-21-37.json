Despite the fact that the concept of neuroplasticity is quite new, it is one of the most important discoveries in neuroscience. The fact is that neural networks are not fixed, but occurring and disappearing dynamically throughout our whole life, depending on experiences. While we repeatedly practice one activity such as a sequence of movements or a mathematical problem, neuronal circuits are being formed, leading to better ability to perform the practiced task with less waste of energy. Once we stop practicing a certain activity, the brain will redirect these neuronal circuits by a much known \u0027use it or lose it\u2019 principle.

Being conscious about our lives is the least we can do to actually live the better life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, what does neuroplasticity have to do with it? Pretty easy. Neuroplasticity helps our brain to get out of the \u2018comfort zone\u2019, of sorts. It helps us learn new things, thus expanding our brain broad and wide for everything new the world can offer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this course you will learn exactly how Neuroplasticity affects our life and why we have to improve it to improve ourselves. You will also learn what Neuroplasticity can do miraculously, like: fight racism, prejudice, improve your thinking process and so much more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou will also learn about our brain\u2019s capabilities and what it really can do. Did you know that our brain is capable of holding information longer and wider than our lives? That we can possibly know so much that for now we can\u2019t even imagine that happening? That\u2019s because we have to use our brain\u2019s potential and unveil everything it hides.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe will also learn about neurogenesis through our lives. We will learn what neurogenesis is and how it works and affects us.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut of course, we have to exercise to have a result in our Neuroplasticity studies, and that\u2019s exactly what you are going to get. Some exercises will be shown during the course to help you improve your Neuroplasticity and achieve your desired results.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECome along and together we will improve and conquer our brain!

There is often a disconnection between sales and marketing departments in many businesses. This is typically due to a lack of interaction or shared attention. Marketers may give sales a lead they believe to be ideal, but sales are not. It creates tension between two teams to work together, and AI is the perfect way to bring them together. AI can point out positive sales leads, which will also satisfy marketing, and ensure that potential customers are targeted at the right platforms. You don\u0027t want the company that sells accounting software to be advertised by someone. All teams will need to come together and agree on an optimal customer profile, a profile that fits marketing and sales, to better use AI in the B2B lead generation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe profile can consist of multiple variables, such as sector, company level, and how many employees they have. The standards are almost infinite. The AI will use the profile to measure current and potential leads against a selection of pre-defined behavioural criteria. Without us providing all this, the AI will fumble around, essentially throwing darts at a board while blindfolded. The AI can predict future patterns for lead generation, possible spending, and what campaigns or services will draw their interest from this.
