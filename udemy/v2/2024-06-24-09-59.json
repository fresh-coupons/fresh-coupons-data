React, also known as React JS, is a powerful JavaScript library used for building custom, interactive user interfaces using UI components. Some of the most well known examples of organizations using React for their front-end include Netflix, Facebook, and Airbnb. Developed and maintained by Meta along with a community of independent developers, React remains free and open-source. React is a component based library built entirely on JavaScript, which makes it perfect for designing complex UI\u2019s. With React, developers can build encapsulated components that efficiently manage their own state and render UI updates specifically when data changes. For example, think of the automated content refresh feature you see on a twitter feed, or facebook like button. Here the state of the UI component changes on the page, without having to manually refresh when the data is updated. This is just one small, yet powerful feature of React.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThrough a complete hands-on project, this course will teach you all the fundamental principles of React that you must know to become a proficient React developer. We start right from the basics, including the tools needed to get started. From there we dive into JSX, functional components, props, callbacks, and various OnClick events. By this stage, the calculator will have a complete visual display, coupled with functional arithmetic operations. Students then move on to passing parameters in Callback functions, using the React State Hook, and debugging.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn addition to the hands-on React module, we also offer a comprehensive overview of JavaScript for those who need a refresher. Here we start with introducing students to the document object model (DOM) which defines the logical structure of HTML documents. From there we dive into JavaScript to demonstrate various methods in which DOM elements can be manipulated to add interactivity to static components. We start right from the basics, which includes JavaScript placement, and data output. From there we move on to variable declaration, arithmetic operations, operator precedence, data types, and objects. Once the foundations are covered, we move on to more complex operations using Arrays, Conditional Statements, JavaScript comparison operators, booleans and loops. Here students will learn to unleash the true power of JavaScript to render different outcomes based on user interaction. We will explore the use of functions to efficiently handle repetitive tasks and JavaScript events to handle output based on actions and occurrences.

Students will gain an overview of AWS and its core services, including EC2 and storage, before delving into IAM: Identity and Access Management, which enables control of access to AWS resources. Students also learn how to launch EC2 instances, store data in AWS, and use Elastic Load Balancers (ELB), Auto Scaling Groups (ASG), and Route 53 to create a highly available and scalable web application.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe course begins with an explanation of AWS, its benefits, and services offered, with a focus on creating an AWS account, configuring an AWS environment, and understanding billing and pricing models. Students then learn about IAM policies, permissions, and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to manage users, groups, and roles for AWS resource access control.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe course proceeds to cover AWS compute service, EC2, which allows virtual servers in the cloud, and provides flexibility and scalability for web applications. The course teaches how to create an EC2 instance, connect to it using SSH, and configure it for web applications, as well as information about security groups, key pairs, and Elastic IP addresses. Additionally, students learn about AWS storage, including Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) and Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3), and how to use them to store and manage data.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe course then covers ELB, ASG, and Route 53, which provide load balancing, automatic scaling, and DNS management, respectively. Students learn how to use ELB to distribute incoming traffic to multiple EC2 instances, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance. They will also learn how to use ASG to add or remove EC2 instances based on demand and use Route 53 to manage DNS records for their web application.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe next section of the course teaches the fundamentals of PHP and MySQL, including variables, control structures, loops, functions, and how to interact with databases using PHP. Students learn how to create and execute queries, fetch results, and handle errors, as well as PHP security best practices, including SQL injection prevention and user authentication.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EFinally, students will apply what they have learned by creating a member-only blog with user authentication using PHP and MySQL. They will learn how to design a database schema, create PHP scripts to interact with the database, and implement user authentication using sessions and cookies. They will also learn how to create a simple blog interface using HTML and CSS and how to protect the blog content using PHP authentication.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn summary, this course provides students with a solid foundation in AWS, web application development using PHP and MySQL, and the skills necessary to design, develop, and deploy web applications in the cloud using AWS.

Indeed, you will at first learn all the basics of mathematics especially linear algebra. Once again, you will not become a specialist in this field but you will at least understand the basic concepts of it that can be useful for your understanding of quantum computing. Then, you will learn what exactly is an algorithm and what is the difference between a quantum algorithm and a classical mathematical algorithm. Also, we are going to cover different quantum algorithms that are also really popular in this field. Finally, you will have an introduction to Microsoft Q. In my opinion this is pretty important to learn because this is the programming language that is used to perform different quantum calculations as well as testing or running different quantum apps. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, it\u0027s really important to understand that I created this course on the Principe of learning by practice.
