I found this course created by TJ Walker a perfect introduction to the world of media training. I wanted to learn, not only what a media trainer does, but also what steps I would have to take in order to become a successful media trainer--TJ discusses all this in a clear and concise manner, in a tone that is welcoming and never alienating. The only constructive critique I would give would be concerning the technical form of the presentation, more specifically the video quality and picture aesthetic. Going by the current standard as it applies to video, everything we view is in high definition. Having said that, I believe the video quality could be improved upon as well as the backdrop which I found to be a bit generic and outdated. I found these minor flaws to be slightly distracting and given the high caliber of the speaker and the information being presented I believe these aspects detracted, if only marginally, from the quality of the product.\u0022\u0026nbsp;\u003C/em\u003ENick Cisik\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u00225 Stars!

I started out my sales career in car sales. I loved it except I was only there to gain sales experience and I had to always be there to make a sale. I treated my car sales job as my college years. I was there 3 years, 10 months before I discovered brokering money. I sell other people\u2019s money to small business owners. I sell the sexiest product in the world. The one thing that 90% of the world is chasing, I am selling. It\u2019s perfect and you can do it from anywhere in the world. This isn\u2019t a get rich quick scheme so if you are looking for one, you\u2019ve picked up the wrong course. You will have to work, but you can easily make 7-6 figures doing this. I am going to help you avoid some of my mistakes and get to where you want to be quicker. Like I said in the beginning, I was a car salesman. I got burned out and had a young daughter and I have always known that I just wanted to learn how to sell then do my own thing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHow do you Broker Money? \u003C/strong\u003EBasically, You are an Independent sales Organization or ISO for short. Your job is to find small business owners who need money for their business, the business can be a start-up, the business can be in different industries. I would advise you to pick a niche. (More on that later) Once you find people who are in need of money you then connect them to our friends (direct lenders) who have money for sale. You make money in the middle. Your don\u2019t have to put up any of your own money to fund businesses. There\u2019s limited risk to you. Our job is to simply find people who need money for business purposes. As long as you can help people solve their money problems, you will never have money problems of your own. You can make money as soon as the Day after you get started. In this industry we can get businesses funding within 24 hours and we get paid from the direct lenders after the business is funded. In this course, you will learn how to find deals, how to sell and have the opportunity to work with me directly. \u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/business-loan-broker-product-knowledge-sales-marketing/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5462204_f50f.jpg","duration":"2 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"3,527.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["This course is for people who are looking for a career change or an opportunity to work for themselves from home.","Real estate professionals and Mortgage lenders do well in our industry","This course is great for people who are in car sales and are trying to get into a new industry","This course is for business bankers that want to work for themselves and provide loans for businesses"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":19,"averageValue":"4.6"},"instructors":[{"name":"Amir Towns","url":"/user/amir-towns-2/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.5}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"55B72A6307C338A31A09","originalPrice":"\u20B91,699","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"3 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/self-care-101-design-your-uncomfortable-box/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5607524,"title":"Self Care 101: Design Your UNCOMFORTABLE Box","shortDescription":"Power your way to self care and self love by making yourself uncomfortable through this unique course","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EDo you often feel frustrated, angry, or hurt by things, people, or scenarios that make you uncomfortable?

In the first section, we will introduce linear programming, and we will explore the convexity and types of optimalities. Then, in the second section, we will build up on the basics to learn ways to solve the linear program using the simplex method. We will then explore the concept of linear programming duality. We will also go through some of the hardest-to-understand concepts like strong duality, complementary slackness, and Farkas\u0027 lemma. Furthermore, we try to understand these concepts in an easy-to-follow way. This allows one to obtain lower bounds on the minimization problem and provide proof of optimality or Infeasibility. In the last section, we will explore how to perform sensitivity analysis (the effects of changing parts of a linear program).

That was the first time I\u0026nbsp;heard the term, \u0022inner peace.\u0022\u0026nbsp; I didn\u0027t know what that was and certainly didn\u0027t know how to obtain it. I was a wreck and my life was a mess. However, Gen Togden inspired me and I made a commitment to find inner peace no matter what. That was the start of my journey inwards. I\u0026nbsp;am happy to report that at this time in my life I have inner peace but it did take me quite a few years to change my life. Changing habits and lifestyle and patterns is a process. In this course I\u0026nbsp;will lead you through the steps I took and the changes I made that helped me to find inner peace. We will start with the tangible physical space, something that is more obtainable, then move inward toward the emotional and mental space. The most important take away from this entire course is that your perspective is what creates peace. If we want peace in the world we must have peace in our own hearts, minds and lives.

This is a comprehensive tutorial for human resources professionals, hiring managers, and recruiters to automate recruitment processes using AI tools. This course will give you a whole new perspective about the future of hiring and talent acquisition. You will be fascinated by how far artificial intelligence has advanced in the past few years to the point where you can use AI to write job descriptions, write interview questions, automatically generate insights from candidate\u2019s resume, conduct live interviews with AI virtual recruiters, and even do a fully automated coding or technical assessment. In the introduction session, you will learn how Ai can help you to automate and speed up the recruitment process by outsourcing some of the repetitive work to AI. Then, you will continue by learning to find qualified job candidates with AI. You are going to use Holly Hires AI and Each Hire to approach the top talents in the industry. Afterward, in the next session, you will learn to write job descriptions and interview questions using AI tools like Careers AI, Hire Hoc, Trio Dev, and Logic Balls. Then, you will also learn how to scan a candidate\u0027s resume and automatically generate valuable insights from the resume using AI tools like Hire Lake AI, Lisa Recruiter, and CV Grader. Those AI tools will enable you to find top talents in the industry by automatically filtering the candidates that match with skills, qualifications, and working experience that you specify in the job description. After finding the right candidates, you will continue the process by setting up an interview, you will learn to interview your candidates using an AI virtual recruiter which means that you don\u2019t have to be present during the interview, instead you only need to share the interview invitation to each candidate. For this task, you will use AI tools like Talently AI, Greet AI, Easy Hire, and Hireflix.. In addition to the interview session, if you are a tech recruiter, most likely, you will need to set up a coding interview to test your candidate\u2019s programming skills, therefore, in the next session, you will learn how to create technical assessment using Codeaid IO. Lastly, at the end of the course, you will learn about the ethical considerations and candidate\u2019s privacy. We are going to have discussions regarding informed consent, data retention policies, data security, algorithmic bias, compliance with policy regulations, data ownership, and sharing policy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirstly, before getting into the course, we need to ask this question to ourselves, why should we utilise AI for the recruitment process? Well, there are many reasons why, firstly you will be able to automate a lot of repetitive tasks by outsourcing those tasks to AI, let me give you an example. There are five hundredths of candidates applying for the job, how long will it take you to read and analyse resumes from each candidate? Maybe days or even weeks, however, by using AI to scan and automatically find the top talents by matching their skills with the required qualifications, you will be able to save a lot of your time. Besides that, AI will also help you to make a better and data driven decision when it comes to deciding which candidate to hire. Last but not least, integrating AI to the recruitment process can also improve the overall recruitment experience for both candidates and recruiters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow are things that you can expect to learn from this course:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how AI can be used to automate and speed up recruitment process\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to find most qualified candidates using Holly Hires AI\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to find do talent sourcing using Each Hire\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to write job description and interview questions using Careers AI\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to write job description and interview questions using Hire Hoc\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to write interview questions using Trio\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to write job description using Logic Balls\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to conduct resume screening using Hire Lake AI, Lisa Recruiter, and CV Grader\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to interview job applicants using Greet AI, Talently AI, and Easy Hire\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to set up one way interview using Hireflix and D-ID\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to create technical assessment for coding interview using Codeaid\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn about ethical considerations for AI recruitment and candidate\u2019s privacy\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/interview-your-job-candidates-with-ai-virtual-hiring-manager/","imageUri":"https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5689832_953a_2.jpg","duration":"2.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"578.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Recruiters, hiring managers, and HR professionals who want to automate and speed up recruitment process using AI","HR professionals who are interested in interviewing their job candidates using AI virtual interviewer"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":0,"averageValue":"0.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"Christ Raharja","url":"/user/christ-raharja/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":0}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"1F4B6DCB11843C23B1F9","originalPrice":"\u20B91,699","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"3 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/how-to-heal-deep-seeded-wounds-and-be-free/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5512584,"title":"How To Heal Deep Seeded Wounds and Be Free","shortDescription":"Practical and Spiritual Guidance to Heal Your Life through your Heart","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EI teach from my life experience.

It\u0027s a way to process requests globally before they reach the view or after the view has processed them. Each middleware component is responsible for doing some specific function. For example, Django includes middleware to handle user authentication, cross-site request forgery protection, and more. This system of middleware makes Django highly customizable and flexible, allowing developers to add or modify functionalities at a global level in the application.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EQuestion:\u003C/strong\u003E What is the primary use of the Django ORM?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOptions:\u003C/strong\u003E \u003Cbr\u003EA.

This abstraction enables developers to work with database records as Python objects, making the code more readable and maintainable. The ORM takes care of translating Python code into database queries and vice versa, thereby simplifying database interactions. It\u0027s an essential part of Django, as it facilitates database operations without needing developers to be experts in SQL.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EQuestion:\u003C/strong\u003E In Django, what is the role of the \u0022views py\u0022 file?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOptions:\u003C/strong\u003E \u003Cbr\u003EA.

It receives web requests and returns web responses after processing the necessary data. Views in Django can be function-based or class-based, and they interact with models to retrieve data, process it, and pass it to templates for rendering HTML responses. Essentially, views act as a bridge between the models and templates, playing a crucial role in Django\u0027s MVC-like architecture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EQuestion:\u003C/strong\u003E What is the significance of Django\u0027s \u0022settings py\u0022 file?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOptions:\u003C/strong\u003E \u003Cbr\u003EA.

This file includes a variety of settings, such as database configurations, installed apps, middleware configurations, template settings, and more. It\u0027s a central place for managing how the Django application behaves in different environments (e.g., development, testing, production).

When a form is submitted, Django checks the token to ensure that the request is legitimate and not forged. This token is unique to each user session, providing a way to verify that the person submitting the form is the same person who requested the page. This security feature is crucial in preventing CSRF attacks, where a malicious actor can trick a user into submitting a request to a web application where they are authenticated without their knowledge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnroll in the \u0022Ultimate Django Practice Tests: Master Your Interview Skills\u0022 course today and take the first step towards acing your Django interviews and advancing your career.

This technique is a form of horizontal scaling, which helps in managing large data sets and high throughput operations by spreading the load across multiple machines. Each shard holds a portion of the data and functions as a separate database, allowing MongoDB to scale out and handle more data and more queries than a single server could.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat is the primary purpose of using an index in MongoDB?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA.

Indexes support the efficient execution of queries in MongoDB. Without indexes, MongoDB must perform a collection scan, i.e., scan every document in a collection, to select those documents that match the query statement. Indexes are special data structures that store a small portion of the collection\u0027s data in an easy-to-traverse form. The index stores the value of a specific field or set of fields, ordered by the value of the field as specified in the index.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIn MongoDB, what does the \u0027Write Concern\u0027 setting dictate?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA.

It is a crucial setting that determines the guarantee of writes to the database. The Write Concern can be configured to return an acknowledgment after writing to a specific number of nodes in a replica set, ensuring data durability and consistency. Higher levels of write concern can protect against data loss in the event of a node failure but may impact the performance due to the increased acknowledgment requirements.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhich of the following is a core component of MongoDB\u2019s replication mechanism?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA.

It is a special capped collection that keeps a rolling record of all operations that modify the data stored in the database. Replica set members use the oplog to replicate data changes to other nodes. When a primary node performs a write operation, this operation is recorded in the oplog. Secondary nodes then replicate and apply these oplog entries in an asynchronous process. This mechanism ensures data consistency and high availability in MongoDB\u0027s replica sets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat is GridFS in MongoDB, and when is it used?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA.

Instead of storing a large file in a single document, GridFS divides the file into smaller chunks, typically of 255KB, and stores each chunk as a separate document. By splitting the file, MongoDB can manage and retrieve large files efficiently. GridFS also allows for partial retrieval of files, which means you can access portions of large files without having to load entire files into memory. \u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEnroll Now\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJoin our course today and take the first step towards mastering MongoDB and acing your next interview.

This is particularly useful in scenarios where having more than one instance of a class could lead to issues (e.g., configurations, database connections). The Singleton pattern is implemented by creating a class with a method that creates a new instance of the class if one doesn\u0027t exist. If an instance already exists, it simply returns a reference to that object.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EQuestion 5:\u003C/strong\u003E What is the significance of an Interface in C#?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA) To provide default implementation of methods\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB) To enforce a contract for what a class can do\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EC) To enable multiple inheritance of implementation\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ED) To declare static methods only\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAnswer:\u003C/strong\u003E B) To enforce a contract for what a class can do\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EExplanation:\u003C/strong\u003E An interface in C# specifies a contract or a set of guidelines that a class or a struct can implement. Interfaces define properties, methods, and events, which are the members of the interface. However, it does not provide any implementation for these members. It is up to the implementing class or struct to provide the implementation details. Interfaces are used to achieve polymorphism and abstraction in C#, allowing different classes to implement the same interface in diverse ways while ensuring a certain level of consistency and predictability in their behavior.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBy the end of this course, you will have a solid grasp of C# and be well-prepared to tackle interview questions with confidence.
