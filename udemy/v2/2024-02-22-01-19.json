It assumes that you\u0027re new to the language, so it gets you started with basic functionality such as creating functions, creating variables, and calling these lines of code from your standard HTML pages. It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are practicals of:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E* Javascript Course Contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Array\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Variables\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Functions\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Objects\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Control Statements\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Cookies\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Loop statements\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESee you inside the course\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-practicals-crash-course/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4200228_c917_2.jpg","duration":"38 total mins","enrolledStudentsCount":"104,546.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["For Javascript  Programming Beginners","For People New to Javascript","For People Who want to learn Javascript Fundamentals and later Transition into Web Development"],"tags":["JavaScript"],"rating":{"count":1251,"averageValue":"4.1"},"instructors":[{"name":"PROPER DOT INSTITUTE","url":"/user/vivek-dahibhate-2/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.1488094}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"1F277E47B58352985FBB","originalPrice":"\u20B93,499","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/curso-de-hostgator-el-hosting-ideal-para-wordpress/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4110222,"title":"Curso de HostGator 2024: El Hosting Ideal Para WordPress","shortDescription":"Domina HostGator, el hosting ideal para WordPress, y gestiona tus dominios y sitios web, de forma f\u00E1cil y simple.","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHOSTGATOR\u003C/strong\u003E es un servicio de alojamiento web que proporciona alojamiento compartido, alojamiento en la nube, soluciones empresariales, alojamiento de correo electr\u00F3nico y registro de dominio.\u0026nbsp; Es uno de los proveedores de hosting (alojamiento web) m\u00E1s populares y con m\u00E1s demanda del internet.

Online I\u0027ve taught \u003Cstrong\u003Eover a million students\u003C/strong\u003E and have hundreds of thousands o\u003Cstrong\u003Ef 5-star ratings and reviews.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is an \u003Cstrong\u003Einteractive course\u003C/strong\u003E full of \u003Cstrong\u003Eexercises\u003C/strong\u003E and \u003Cstrong\u003Efun challenges\u003C/strong\u003E that force you to practice the skills you are learning. You\u0027ll encounter some of the same assignments and \u003Cstrong\u003Eprojects\u003C/strong\u003E that my in-person bootcamp students experience. Learning command after command can be a dreadfully boring experience, but I\u0027ve tried my best to make this course as exciting and interesting as possible :) You may roll your eyes at my jokes, but you won\u0027t be bored!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe course starts with a deep dive into confusing technical terms like \u003Cstrong\u003Eterminal\u003C/strong\u003E, \u003Cstrong\u003Eshell\u003C/strong\u003E, \u003Cstrong\u003Ekernel\u003C/strong\u003E, \u003Cstrong\u003EUnix\u003C/strong\u003E, \u003Cstrong\u003EUnix-Like\u003C/strong\u003E, \u003Cstrong\u003EGNU\u003C/strong\u003E, \u003Cstrong\u003ELinux\u003C/strong\u003E, and \u003Cstrong\u003EBash\u003C/strong\u003E. It\u0027s important to understand the context and the WHYs around the command line and its history that still impacts our machines today.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen we shift our focus to the general patterns and \u003Cstrong\u003Estructure that all commands follow\u003C/strong\u003E including options and arguments. This blueprint we define will inform every single other topic we cover throughout the rest of the course.
