This is basically an extensive project based course where you will be guided step by step on how to build a dynamic action survival game from scratch using Godot Engine and potentially build a sustainable passive income from selling the game on online Marketplaces. This course will teach you on how to build and design games without having to know extensive programming skill as Godot Engine has a visual scripting feature that allows you to drag and drop objects. In the introduction session, you will learn the basic fundamentals of Godot Engine, technologies used behind it, and its main use cases, then continue with a full step by step tutorial on how to install Godot Engine, tutorial to navigate its dashboard, as well as exploring all features available on that platform. Afterward, you will also be shown a couple examples of games created using Godot Engine and going over all potential game ideas to build. To make the learning experience even more complete, this course also comes with a project where you will be guided step by step on how to build an action survival theme game from scratch using Godot Engine. Once the game has been built, we will be conducting testing to make sure that all features have been fully functioning and most essentially the game has a friendly user interface from the player perspectives. In the testing session, there will be three main objectives that need to be tested, those are functional testing, performance testing, and user experience testing. Lastly, at the end of the course you will also learn effective marketing strategies that you can implement to reach more potential audiences to play your game as well as get to know several marketplace to sell your games like Itch IO and Steam.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, before getting into the course, we need to ask ourselves this question. Why should we learn building games using Godot? Well, the answer might be pretty obvious to some people, this is one of the best platform that you can utilise to build and design game without having very advances programming skills, other than that, there are still many other reasons why, Godot Engine has been well known to offer a comprehensive set of game creation tools, including a visual scripting system, 3D modelling tools, terrain editors, and animation tools. Not only that, Godot also provides social features that allow users to connect, collaborate, and engage with other players and creators. Users can join communities, participate in events, share feedback, and form friendships within the platform\u0027s social ecosystem. Last but not least, Godot supports multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, HTML5, and more. It provides a unified development environment that allows developers to create games that can run seamlessly on different operating systems and devices. Hence, when it comes to compatibility testing for the game that you build and design using Godot Engine, most likely it would pass without any issue\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow are things that you will learn from the course:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearning basic fundamentals of Godot engine, getting to know technologies behind it, and its use cases\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExploring Godot dashboard \u0026amp; features\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearning basic GDscript code\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBuilding \u0026amp; designing flappy bird clone game\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBuilding \u0026amp; designing ping pong game\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearning game testing objectives: functional testing, user experience testing, and performance testing\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearning effective marketing strategies to promote your game\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGetting to know marketplaces where game developers can sell their game\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/building-flappy-bird-ping-pong-games-with-godot-engine/","imageUri":"https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5412300_177f.jpg","duration":"4 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"2,245.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["People who are interested in building games using Godot Engine","People who are interested to learn GDscript programming language"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":0,"averageValue":"0.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"Christ Raharja","url":"/user/christ-raharja/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":0}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"3106E5272A6050A2C817","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"3 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/html-javascript-bootstrap-certification-course/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":2410966,"title":"HTML, JavaScript, \u0026 Bootstrap - Certification Course","shortDescription":"A Comprehensive Guide for Beginners interested in learning HTML, JavaScript, \u0026 Bootstrap.

There are a few common elements to a performance management system:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA performance review, a manager-to-manager meeting, peer feedback, a performance improvement program, goal-setting, tracking, rewards and recognition\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETypically, managers track and develop their team members\u0027 performance and then report to their higher leadership team. Employees used to get annual performance reviews as part of the performance management process. In recent years, research has shown that frequent feedback is more effective than annual reviews, so many companies have dropped the annual review model for regular manager check-ins and informal feedback sessions. By making small adjustments over time instead of trying to make one big course correction at the end of the year, this type of performance management can help employees understand and align with company goals and objectives.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this master course I would like to teach the 5 major topics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

You will also learn how to create Trojans by disguising ordinary files (such as an image or pdf file) and sending fake emails that appear as if they were sent from the target\u0027s friend, boss, or any email account they are likely to interact with in order to run your Trojan. .\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.

Zero trust architectures simplify network infrastructure, make users happier, and keep cyberthreats at a distance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince John Kindervag, then at Forrester Research, coined the phrase, zero trust architectures follow the maxim \u0022never trust, always verify.\u0022 To block inappropriate access and lateral movement throughout an environment, zero trust architecture enforces access policies based on context\u2014including the user\u0027s role and location, the device they\u0027re using, and the data they\u0027re asking for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA zero trust architecture means you know who\u0027s using what, and you can track it, including encrypted traffic; you need to monitor and verify the traffic between parts of the environment; and you need multifactor authentication (MFA) that goes beyond passwords.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn important thing to remember is that in a zero trust architecture, a resource\u0027s location isn\u0027t as important as before. Rather than rigid network segmentation, software-defined microsegmentation protects your data, workflows, services, and such anywhere, in your data center or distributed hybrid or multicloud.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy using a network-centric data security strategy that provides specific access only to those who need it, Zero Trust Architecture focuses on the business needs and functionality of an organization. By enabling parameters to dictate access and restrictions, the Zero Trust model views data security from a whole new perspective. As opposed to legacy networks that have little to no visibility or control over network and data usage, Zero Trust Architectures see all network traffic through segmentation gateways with granular policies governing access to data, apps, and assets. There are certain rules that have to be followed before a resource can be accessed in a Zero Trust network.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe five major topics I want to cover in this master\u0027s course are\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.
