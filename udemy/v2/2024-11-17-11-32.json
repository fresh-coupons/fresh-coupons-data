It assumes that you\u0027re new to the language, so it gets you started with basic functionality such as creating functions, creating variables, and calling these lines of code from your standard HTML pages. It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E*\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E javascript course contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript introduction\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript array\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript variables\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript functions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript objects\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript control statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript cookies\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript loop statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript data structures\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript error handling\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript regular expressions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003Esection 3- learn PHP\u0026nbsp;programming language\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis section will learn the basic structure of a web application and how a web browser interacts with a web server.

Exploring this topic is as challenging as it is interesting. But while there may exist many depictions and images on temples and tomb walls that describe in detail the pharaonic home and kitchen, as well as the kinds of foods offered on almost all occasions from the dawn of the Predynastic era, the ancient Egyptians did not leave behind any recipes. As such it remains difficult, as one can imagine,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eto specify weights, measurements, and methods of preparation with any clear precision.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDue to the specific cultural heritage of each area, ways of cooking may differ from one place to another, helping to individualize that region despite the similarity of ingredients. In Lower Egypt, or the Delta, for example, there has been a consecutive influence of Greeks and Romans, foreign immigration, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of these have directly impacted food and cooking habits as well as recipe variations, and the modern Egyptian kitchen in this region is the outcome of these influences.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut this has not been the case with southern Egypt (Upper Egypt and Nubia), where cooking methods and ingredients have likely remained\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eunchanged since the days of the pharaohs due to the relative lack of foreign influences in the area. Very early on in the project it quickly became apparent that cooking methods in Upper Egypt and Nubia\u2014regions that have always been strongly insular, adhering closely to ancient cultures and inherited traditions\u2014have retained a pharaonic influence in their simplicity, their tendency to use few ingredients and spices, and their preference for vegetables, grains, spices, and herbs indigenous to the region. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Es noted earlier, the ancient Egyptians left few if any recipes, so the ingredients in this course have been slightly modified to suit modern tastes.

In villas, the kitchen was located entirely outside the house. A grain storehouse would serve the kitchen, sometimes being located alongside it or on the roof where it could be reached by stairs.The kitchen area would be constructed along simple lines. In one corner there would be an oven covered in a layer of mud or a stove.

Food sources were diverse, and ancient Egyptians made good use of the different kinds of fish, vegetables, poultry, and fruits. The staple diet of most Egyptians consisted of bread and beer in addition to what produce the land yielded, such as onions, garlic, lentils, leeks, turnips, radish, lettuce, and cucumbers. Since the Predynastic period, ancient Egyptians, rich or poor, consumed various breads made from different grains. Flour would generally be mixed with a yeasting agent, salt, and spices, and sometimes with eggs and butter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe bread could also be filled with legumes or vegetables or sweetened with honey or dates. The ancient Egyptians also used a fair share of legumes such as beans, chickpeas, and lentils as well as vegetables such as peas, lettuce, garlic, onions, and leeks. Dates were the most common fruit, in addition to figs, grapes, pomegranates, watermelon and plums, all of which appear in depictions of daily life dating back to the New Kingdom. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFood and Social Status\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETypes of food eaten give a clearer picture of the different social levels in the ancient Egyptian hierarchy.

Ancient Egyptians were easily satisfied with a few loaves of bread, a share of beer, some leeks, and onions. The numerous tomb reliefs that picture the many pleasures of food and drink were probably more indicative of the lives of the upper strata of society, like the higher civil servants, priests, landowners, and nobles. The masses would wait for feasts and special occasions for an excuse to indulge. They likely did not have to wait long as festivals were numerous, judging by the annual special occasions relating to the seasons, the Nile, sowing, harvesting, as well as coronations and funerals \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFood and the Gods\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ancient Egyptians identified spiritually with the forces of nature surrounding them, including the sun, moon, wind, the inundation of the Nile, the strength of fierce animals like lions, snakes, and crocodiles, or powerful animals that were of use to them like cows and bulls. There were many gods, one for each invisible force behind the phenomenon, thus becoming intertwined with the lives of the ancient Egyptians. They did not only worship tangible powers, but also less tangible ones symbolized by animals. For example, the force of wisdom was symbolized by the ibis of Thoth, and fertility by the bull.26 The deification of animals made them a symbol for a certain god or power, but it did not stop the ancients from using them for food, transport, or other purposes. Thus the cow was used for farming, and though the ancient Egyptians deified the crocodile, they didn\u2019t find anything \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Efood and language\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe hieroglyphs used by the ancients were numerous and pictorial: symbols of people, animals, tools and implements, as well as food items. The foods were not chosen randomly, but in fact were built on the importance of that symbol to the lives of the ancient Egyptians. Among the twenty-four letters of the ancient Egyptian alphabet, four are related to food: I was represented by a leaf of a plant. N was represented by water, the source of life. W was represented by a baby quail, one of the birds that were hunted. Quails are also migratory birds and so may have had special significance in certain times of the year.

The latter was prepared by boiling crushed beans, mashing them into a smooth thick paste, then adding spices and herbs such as cumin, dry and fresh coriander, salt, parsley, and dry Jew\u2019s mallow.

He is well known for his prophecy that communication technology would one day make us one great \u0022global village\u0022. In the end, the processes and theories regarding communication in our daily lives to exchange information, create meaning, and share understanding remain critical components of human relationships. Whether we are chatting with a stranger while waiting for a bus, solving a problem with a group of coworkers, or sharing our dreams and goals with our best friend, the principles and practices of human communication are at the foundation of each of these human transactions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis course will introduce you to communication principles, common communication practices, and a selection of theories to better understand the communication transactions that you experience in your daily life. The principles and practices that you study in this course will provide the foundation for further study in communications. This course begins with an overview of communication as a process, along with basic principles and theories. Subsequent units in the course examine specific applications of human communication in your personal and professional life. These include interpersonal communication, small group communication, decision-making, and organizational communication. By the end of this course, you will be able to identify the process of human communication in a number of settings that affect your daily activities.

What is the purpose of studying how to lead a team? Aren\u0027t all leaders born and not made? If that is the truth, then millions of people are wasting their time trying to improve their leadership skills. Fortunately, trying to become a better leader is not a waste of time. While it is true that some leaders are born, most are made by studying what makes an effective leader.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this introductory unit, you will explore the four pillars of good management: management, leadership, groups, and teams. Management and leadership are often used interchangeably; the same applies for groups and teams. Management is about allocating resources; leadership is about empowering people. A group is a collection of individuals with a similar interest. Teams have a similar goal, but teams work together. A good leader will help a group and become a team\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo prepare you for this course, this unit concludes with a look at some great leaders in history. These four individuals are selected for their broad experiences and abilities to manage groups and teams. The spectrum goes from sports team management to inspiring political movements, and from brilliant corporate management to excellence in military and national leadership.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELeadership Theory\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPeople have studied leadership since ancient times, and theories of leadership have been around for centuries (Plato, Sun Tzu, Machiavelli, and so on). However, it wasn\u0027t until the 20th century that modern theories began to take shape. Today, researchers study leadership the same way that they study other aspects of psychology: they seek to get a better understanding of people\u0027s behavior and motivation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem with some of these theories is that they tend to contradict instead of complement each other. They seek to identify one set of rules or behaviors that turns someone into a leader. The reality is likely a combination of all the theories and some ideas that have yet to be defined. It is best to study these theories with an open mind and understand that they each have their own merits. Remember that emphasis should not be placed on any one theory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChange Management and Decision-Making\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe most difficult task for a manager is implementing changes without disrupting the whole business. Changes to the normal business operation will have supporters and protesters. It is important for a manager to understand the point of views from both sides. Sometimes the changes are minor, such as a new benefits plan. Other times major changes must be made, such as moving the operations across the country and laying off employees. The only certainty with change is that you cannot please everyone, but a good manager will anticipate reactions and focus on effective communication.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth major and minor changes are often the result of a decision-making process. There are many different ways to approach a decision, and each method has an appropriate time and place. Decisions can be based on dictatorial edicts, on a leader\u0027s decision derived from consultation with subordinates, or on a more collective process where everyone can develop and agree on the final outcome. These methods will be presented in this unit. In addition, one must also address the real probability that decisions, regardless of the process by which they are derived, will be clouded by any of a number of biases. We also present the most critical of those biases, including anchoring, groupthink, and selective perception, in this unit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELeading Without Formal Authority\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile many students of this course will go on to manage teams, organizations, and companies, everyone will have opportunities to lead without being granted any actual authority (called \u0022legitimate power\u0022). To leverage these opportunities, you must know what types of power exist and when to use them. For example, having expert power allows someone to step-up, because they have the most knowledge about a specific subject.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELeading without authority goes beyond power; the ability to influence without manipulation, emotional intelligence, and interpersonal skills are all important aspects of gaining power and leadership without having direct authority over a group or team. After studying these topics, you will be able to recognize when a leader takes over a situation and to determine who may be the best leader for a given situation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EManaging Groups and Teams\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhether your power base is legitimate or otherwise, you may find yourself potentially in a leadership position within a group or team. But what is the difference between a group and a team? This was touched on in the first unit, but further distinction is needed here. Groups are often formed organically. Think about a group of car enthusiasts: they come together because of a similar interest. There may not be an underlying goal other than to share ideas and discuss topics of mutual interest. Teams are formed more strategically. For example, think about a professional sports team; management carefully selects and trains players, and together they work toward the common goal of winning games.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETeams should function in the way a group does: with a more relaxed atmosphere, which will allow each contributor to feel comfortable in his or her role. Maintaining this atmosphere can be difficult, because teams sometimes work in very stressful environments. This is why building a good team with great dynamics is so important and so challenging. A team that functions well together will be more productive than a team that does not have a good dynamic. Thus, this unit will enable you to explore the world of teams and groups. You will learn about the internal processes that underlie team/group formation and maintenance as well as the role of leadership in these types of settings. The unit opens with a discussion of diversity. While the value of diversity in an organization is not restricted to team processes, scholars and business practitioners both agree that team performance is improved by a diverse membership.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs stated throughout, this course will not make you a good leader or member of a team, but it can give you the tools that will help you recognize what makes a team effective and identify the players that serve best as leaders.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/leadership-vs-mangement/","imageUri":"https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5923892_2aa6_2.jpg","duration":"1 total hour","enrolledStudentsCount":"1,663.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["future leaders and talent managers"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":8,"averageValue":"4.2"},"instructors":[{"name":"Mohamed AL ashram","url":"/user/mohamed-taha-288/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.25}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"8ABE6948AFCCE6C33702","originalPrice":"\u20B91,499","discountedPrice":"\u20B9449","expirationText":"5 hours","discountPercentage":70}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/oncology-understanding-cancer-biology-diagnosis-treatments/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5957986,"title":"oncology understanding cancer biology diagnosis treatments","shortDescription":"oncology basics","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E Cancer biology is a rapidly evolving field, and new discoveries are constantly being made.
