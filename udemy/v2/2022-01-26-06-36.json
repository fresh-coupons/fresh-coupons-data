A classic example of viral content, the internet meme typically takes the form of a video or image of one or two lines of text. However, it is possible to spread virally any type of online content that appeals to users enough to make them want to share it. \u003Cstrong\u003EVideos go viral\u003C/strong\u003E because they connect with their audience and engage or wow them to the maximum potential.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe notion of viral content has two interdependent sides. \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EWhen a piece of content excites the viewers on the human side, it induces an emotional response to the point that they can\u0027t help but share it.

You have to ask with everything you create: would I care if this scrolled through on my newsfeed?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor various reasons, content goes viral. Keep that in mind. Entertainment value is a common feature; other features include usefulness, information, artistic merit, the promotion of points of view, and the value of shock.\u0026nbsp; Another viral content driver is the audience and reputation of the sharer. Social influencers have built an online presence on social media platforms such as Facebook, LinkedIn,\u0026nbsp;Pinterest, and Quora across multiple channels and large follow-ups are present in those streams.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGoing viral is a hard thing to do when it comes to advertising content. What will spark a post to make it go viral is not always obvious. Evidence suggests that content is not plain, but amplification.

Animation specialists know that \u003Cstrong\u003E2D\u003C/strong\u003E is a more simple technique - whatsoever, so it\u0027s a lot easier to learn and execute, but it still takes just as much, and even often more, time to do than \u003Cstrong\u003E3D\u003C/strong\u003E. On top of that, 3D is a lot more complicated than 2D.\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s for this reason that many producers are looking into 2D production as an animation technique. It\u0027s a technique that is not new though, but quite the contrary - it has been around since the \u002750s, actually much longer. However, it\u0027s been in the past couple of years that 3D animation has risen to the top. Just look at all the movies that were nominated this year for an Academy Award and you\u0027ll see that most, if not all of them, are 3D. If you think about all those movies, for example, \u0022Life of Pi\u0022, \u0022Hugo\u0022, and \u0022Hayao Miyazaki\u0027s\u0022 movies (\u0022The Wind Rises\u0022 and \u0022Ponyo\u0022), they were all done in 3D. This past year saw a large rise in 3D movies than 2D movies, especially when you compare it to the years before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 3D\u0026nbsp;animation process normally has three phases associated with it being - the following stages:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E1. Pre-production stage:\u003C/strong\u003E\u0026nbsp;This process includes concept creation, creating rough storyboards, making script reels, and character modelling. This is the most difficult stage of it all and also it involves a lot of brainstorming to be done by a huge team who will be working on the animation project.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E2. Production stage: \u003C/strong\u003EThis involves the creation of the animated film\u0027s animated elements brought together layer-by-layer and scene-by-scene, all into one place, ready for the final touches to be done or applied. This is usually termed as the \u0022Creation Stage\u0022 too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E3. Post-production stage:\u0026nbsp;\u003C/strong\u003EThis stage deals with rendering of the 3D animation and editing the video using any video editing software like Adobe Premiere Pro, iMovie for Mac or Final\u0026nbsp;Cut Pro (FCP).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe above phases also have multiple sub-processes within them.\u0026nbsp;Thus, this makes 3D animation a complicated process - \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Euntil now\u003C/em\u003E!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EForget being an animation specialist or learning 3D\u0026nbsp;animation from scratch.\u0026nbsp;\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EWhat if we told you that you could create amazing 3D animation videos at high speed using the world\u0027s most powerful and secretive software?\u0026nbsp;What if we told you that this is all possible without modelling, texturing, rigging, lighting or manual animation unlike leveraging traditional animation software to create a 3D output? \u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis means simply speeding up the three phases that we just talked about above by 99x.

However, while AI and machine learning are rapidly altering our environment and propelling the Fourth Industrial Revolution, humanity does not need to be concerned. Artificial Intelligence (AI) will provide people with the ability to focus on the aspects of their occupations or jobs that are most rewarding to them and the time is coming soon. \u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe must also note that Artificial intelligence is influencing the future of almost every sector and every person on the planet.

AI is believed to become the biggest business opportunity of the next decade and many more decades to come. The rise of AI will not be a threat in this new world order; rather, it will be a tremendous benefit. Not only is AI poised to impact the future of every single person and organisation in the world, but it is also poised to change the future of whole countries\u0027 governments, politics, and economies. As we move toward a world of totally automated work, we\u0027ll need to start adopting new rules and ideas. We\u0027ll have to start thinking about the future more than we do now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Future of Jobs in the 21st Century:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 21st century is inching toward what many believe is the singularity or the time when manual work will all die out. There are still many jobs that we will have on our resume, but they will be less glamorous, fewer in number, and have little to do with our lives. We\u0027ll have far more disposable income, but it will be much greater still. The work, which will often be a repetitive, uninteresting and boring part of our jobs, will be replaced by the jobs of a new, automated digital future. This new age of automation and digital replacement will be of tremendous benefit to everyone but the workers themselves. The work will be performed on smart cloud computers and brilliantly capable-intelligent devices, which should offer us less of a challenge than ever before in recent history. If the future is any indication, a new and entirely digital world is now on the horizon. We are already seeing the results of this transition, with computers working across disciplines and tasks. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the newest and most amazing technologies is 3D printing, a process that is being used to create amazing items of art. This may not be practical, but it is something new that is just beginning to be experienced. People are inventing more and more advanced ways of creating things, not just for themselves, but for others. Even more incredible, our ability to design and create artificial intelligence and machines with their own personalities and motivations is being brought into the picture. As we make the machines smarter and more capable, each individual will have a role that is different than they would in any other scenario of the future. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany people see artificial intelligence as a danger, and they see the power of artificial intelligence in our personal lives, in our jobs, in our families. Artificial intelligence has created problems for many people. There is another possibility that has come along that we can think is a bit better, to begin with than what we are seeing today. One such possibility is a group that believes it can reverse engineer human DNA and then create a new biological \u0022self.\u0022 For this to happen, however, scientists first have to figure out a way to reverse engineer human DNA. Since we don\u0027t have the technological capability to reverse engineer human DNA today, this can be an extremely difficult path for anyone to take. The solution might not even be discovered until very late in the game until hundreds of years to come, however, and perhaps even we could lose much of our future. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s now talk about digital mind clone software where we can store our thoughts and ideas.

This course teaches you the fundamentals of Six Sigma. It not just helps with change management within your company but also helps your organization to prepare for the new normal. Customer expectations or demands are constantly changing in this world governed by technology. Six Sigma\u0027s emphasis on customer satisfaction enables the company to produce higher-quality products and increase customer loyalty over time. A product-focused strategy compares the product to the products of competitors in order to reach or slightly exceed such levels. You must know that Six Sigma focuses on minimising process variation and improving process control, whereas lean encourages work standardisation and flow by eliminating waste (non-value added processes and procedures).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease note that to achieve success leveraging the Six Sigma methodology, organisational processes must have a failure rate of no more than 3.4 per million (99.99966%) chances. A Six Sigma defect is anything that isn\u0027t according to the client\u0027s specifications. Its goal is to reduce the amount of variation in commercial and production operations. The capacity to focus on producing quantitative and measurable financial gains from any Six Sigma project is one of the most notable features.

Furthermore, the number of users continues to grow, with new individuals joining every day. These rising numbers demonstrate the marketing potential of social media networks. However, marketers face a difficult problem in utilising this potent technique. On social media, your brand must be consistent, accessible, and relevant.

The answer can already be found in the first sentence. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAudio social media systems appear to fulfil a long-held goal for free and democratic social media. Decentralisation offers a wide range of applications, from cryptocurrency to social media. Unlike podcasts or livestreams, social audio platforms are more of an open conversation than a monologue. Even if you\u0027re in a chatroom full of strangers, group voice chats feel strangely intimate. Audio social media platforms allow users a more democratic option to get their opinion heard in a world where platforms are becoming pay-to-play. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBrands may be able to test audio-based ad formats on audio social networks at some point in the future. They would also be able to \u0022sponsor\u0022 particular discussions, similar to how adverts appear on streaming radio and podcasts. Individual chat rooms would most likely have audio advertising \u2014 a company representative or host would provide a short commercial at the start, middle, and/or end of a conversation. Social audio platforms tend to draw niche audiences, ranging from astrology enthusiasts to side hustlers, providing the ideal opportunity for companies to get in front of their target audience in an audio format. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAccessibility is critical to the development of social media. Some apps or software as we know it are inaccessible to persons who are deaf or hard of hearing due to their audio-only nature. Discord has added certain accessibility features, including text-to-speech and greater screen-reader integration, in response to similar criticisms. Audio platforms must ensure that their platform is accessible to everyone in order to survive. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne way audio platforms keep users interested is through attracting influencers and celebrities who funnel their audience from other media.

Putting aside the excitement of new developments, the convenience that technology may provide is unrivalled. Long before the pandemic, the mix of fitness technology and digital fitness was altering our market; both areas were rising at a rapid pace. This transition affects both consumers (gym goers) and suppliers (gyms/personal trainers) now more than ever before. Fitness businesses and members alike have invested in home new-age fitness equipment - and the fitness industry has shifted online to survive: gyms have improved their online offerings, and members have improved their home set-ups, investing in a variety of equipment, apps, wearables, and fitness trackers for the long-term. The use of social media in gym marketing has become a must. It\u0027s a channel via which people can quickly obtain information. They can provide gym-specific advice or information, thereby educating followers on health and wellness and boosting the active-living trend. Owners are rewarded with useful comments, allowing them to establish a solid business reputation, increase member trust, and attract new potential consumers by mentioning their brand online. People are too communicating with each other online in greater numbers than ever before. They follow an influencer on Instagram, subscribe to a fitness channel on YouTube, join a fitness group on Facebook, and like a friend\u0027s Instagram post about weight reduction success. Gyms are starting to recognise the social component of fitness by making it look that fitness is less about attending the gym and more about living a healthy lifestyle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fitness industry has had to conform to a new normal; future gyms will be hybrid and virtual reality, and gym members will track their progress and exercise both in and out of the gym even digitally!!

They can also create goals and track their progress over time by digging deeper into the tracker\u0027s dashboard. There are plenty of virtual reality programmes nowadays too, you can use to burn calories, but just a few are exclusively focused on exercise right now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApps for fitness have never been more important.

SEO has two key objectives. The first is to help you understand what online users are looking for - so that you can create high-quality content to serve their purpose. The second is to help you create a website that will be able to find, index, and understand its content through search engines. SEO can also put oneself ahead of the competition. If three or four websites are selling the same thing, the search-engine-optimized\u0026nbsp;(SEO) ranked website is more likely to have more customers and make more sales.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first stage in\u0026nbsp;SEO\u0026nbsp;is called \u0022technical SEO\u0022 in the process. Technical SEO, as the name suggests, has little to do with a website\u0027s actual content or with methods of website promotion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo make the job of search engine crawlers easier, it has to do with settings you need to customise. Usually, you do not have to deal with it again until you got your professional SEO right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn-Page SEO is the second stage or step. On-Page SEO mainly has to do with the content and other elements found on a page.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main objective of on-page SEO, unlike technical and off-page SEO, is to provide appropriate signals to search engine crawlers so that they can understand the importance and meaning of your content.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that content optimization is part of SEO on the website, but this is often referred to as \u0022SEO content\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOff-Page SEO deals with primarily \u0022Backlinks\u0022. Backlinks are a sign of confidence and they can dramatically influence your ranking status depending on where the links come from. Your ranking would be favourably impacted if the links come from well-known and trustworthy pages. Your ranking would be adversely affected whether they are paying links, links in article directories, link farms, or a consequence of an exchange.\u0026nbsp;Also, digital marketers should note that if the website rankings and organic traffic are growing, you are in the right direction, then this implies. If not, the SEO strategy and action plan will have to be updated.\u0026nbsp;You can always have an SEO checklist in hand, ready.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you believe you already have all the knowledge, guidance and skills outlined above, then this ultimate search engine optimization\u0026nbsp;(SEO)\u0026nbsp;quiz created by the King of Digital Marketing\u003Cstrong\u003E \u0022Srinidhi\u0026nbsp;Ranganathan\u0022\u003C/strong\u003E and \u003Cstrong\u003E\u0022J.
