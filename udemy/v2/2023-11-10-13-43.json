It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are practicals of:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E* Javascript Course Contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Array\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Variables\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Functions\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Objects\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Control Statements\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Cookies\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Loop statements\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESee you inside the course\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-practicals-crash-course/","imageUri":"https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4200228_c917_2.jpg","duration":"38 total mins","enrolledStudentsCount":"96,544.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["For Javascript  Programming Beginners","For People New to Javascript","For People Who want to learn Javascript Fundamentals and later Transition into Web Development"],"tags":["JavaScript"],"rating":{"count":1119,"averageValue":"4.1"},"instructors":[{"name":"PROPER DOT INSTITUTE","url":"/user/vivek-dahibhate-2/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.103896}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"DEB604B83CA6D4C65F59","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/agile-planning-and-okr/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4659900,"title":"Agile Planning and OKRs: Transforming Your Project Outcomes","shortDescription":"PO Academy III: Building customer-centric products on time and within budget","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Challenge:\u003C/strong\u003E Are your projects consistently overshooting budgets and deadlines?

Learning \u0026 Feature Engineering","shortDescription":"Learn how to build fake news detection model using machine learning, feature engineering, logistic regression, and NLP","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to Detecting Fake News with Machine Learning course. This is a comprehensive project based course where you will learn step by step on how to build a fake news detection system using feature engineering, logistic regression, and other models. This course is a perfect combination between Python and machine learning, making it an ideal opportunity to enhance your data science skills. The course will be mainly focusing on three major aspects, the first one is data analysis where you will explore the fake news dataset from multiple angles, the second one is predictive modeling where you will learn how to build fake news detection system using big data, and the third one is to mitigate potential biases from the fake news detection models. In the introduction session, you will learn the basic fundamentals of fake news detection models, such as getting to know ethical considerations and common challenges. Then, in the next session, we are going to have a case study where you will learn how to implement feature engineering on a simple dataset to predict if a news is real or fake. In the case study you will specifically learn how to identify the presence of specific words which are frequently used in fake news and calculate the probability of a news article is fake based on the track record of the news publisher. Afterward, you will also learn about several factors that contribute to the widespread of fake news \u0026amp; misinformation, for examples like confirmation bias, social media echo chamber, and clickbait incentives. Once you have learnt all necessary knowledge about the fake news detection model, we will begin the project. Firstly you will be guided step by step on how to set up Google Colab IDE. In addition to that, you will also learn how to find and download fake news dataset from Kaggle, Once, everything is ready, we will enter the main section of the course which is the project section The project will be consisted of three main parts, the first part is the data analysis and visualization where you will explore the dataset from various angles, in the second part, you will learn step by step on how to build a fake news detection system using logistic regression and feature engineering, meanwhile, in the third part, you will learn how to evaluate the model\u2019s accuracy. Lastly, at the end of the course, you will learn how to mitigate potential bias in fake news detection systems by diversifying training data and conducting fairness audits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, before getting into the course, we need to ask ourselves this question: why should we build fake news detection systems? Well, here is my answer. In the past couple of years, we have witnessed a significant increase in the number of people using social media and, consequently, an exponential growth in the volume of news and information shared online. While this presents incredible opportunities for communication, however, this surge in information sharing has come at a cost, the rapid spread of unverified, misleading, or completely fabricated news stories. These stories can sway public opinion, incite fear, and even have political and social consequences. In a world where information is power, the ability to distinguish between accurate reporting and deceptive content is very valuable. Last but not least, knowing how to build a complex machine learning model can potentially open a lot of opportunities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow are things that you can expect to learn from this course:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn the basic fundamentals of fake news detection model\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECase study: applying feature engineering to predict if a news title is real or fake\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn factors that contribute to the widespread of fake news \u0026amp; misinformation\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to find and download datasets from Kaggle\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to clean dataset by removing missing rows and duplicate values\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to perform news source credibility\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to detect keywords associated with fake news\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to perform news title and length analysis\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to detect sensationalism in fake news\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to detect emotion in fake new with NLP\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to build fake news detection model with feature engineering\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to build fake news detection model with logistic regression\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to build fake news detection model with Random Forest\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to evaluate fake news detection model with confusion matrix\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to perform fairness audit with demographic parity difference\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to mitigate potential bias in fake news detection\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/detect-fake-news-with-machine-learning-feature-engineering/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5646052_2347.jpg","duration":"3.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"419.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["People who are interested in building fake news detection system using feature engineering, logistic regression, and machine learning","People who are interested in detecting emotion and and sensationalism in fake news using NLP"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":0,"averageValue":"0.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"Christ Raharja","url":"/user/christ-raharja/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":0}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"25E34B1A2B2F355A5F3D","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-albanian-course-learn-albanian-for-beginners/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5641026,"title":"Complete Albanian Course: Learn Albanian for Beginners","shortDescription":"Learn Albanian FAST with this non-stop Albanian speaking course for BEGINNERS: learning Albanian will be easy and fun!","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EHave you ever wanted to learn Albanian?

On a personal level, we negotiate with friends, family, landlords, car sellers, and employers, among others. We come across hundreds of situations that put our negotiation skills to the test. Whether buying a house or car, reviewing your salary with your boss, or deliberating contracts for your business, your success in each of\u003Cstrong\u003E \u003C/strong\u003Ethese activities will be heavily dependent on your ability to negotiate. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut how come I am speaking so highly of negotiation skills?
