Estos enfoques se dividen en dos categor\u00EDas, conocidas como primera composici\u00F3n de vista y primera composici\u00F3n de modelo de vista. Elegir entre ver la primera composici\u00F3n y ver la primera composici\u00F3n del modelo es una cuesti\u00F3n de preferencia y complejidad.

It explores the \u003Cstrong\u003Econcept\u003C/strong\u003E and \u003Cstrong\u003Ehistory\u003C/strong\u003E of competencies in organizations, the different approaches to how it is defined and practiced, and a supporting framework for decision-making. Competencies have been long practiced across most large organizations globally, but as yet, there is no universally accepted definition of what we mean by a \u2018competency.\u2019 Research data suggests it struggles with establishing demonstrable evidence of impacts in organization performance, and whether the resource and cost \u003Cstrong\u003Eimplications for practice through selection and assessment, performance management, succession, and talent management\u003C/strong\u003E exhibit a clear benefit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe know intuitively that competencies are welcomed and needed in all organizations. But what they are and \u003Cstrong\u003Ehow we can illustrate a formal value is challenging\u003C/strong\u003E. Traditional methods of job analysis, work analysis, role design, and KSAOs (Knowledge, Skills, Attributes, Other) demonstrate an effective support for on-the-job-performance (OJP) because over time we develop confidence in the connections between employee characteristics and OJP. But it is competencies which really determine OJP and organization capability development (behavior, values, culture). In many cases, competencies are defined as KSAOs or results \u2013 in which case, a competency is unclear. The course provides a \u003Cstrong\u003Echallenging insight into the concept of competencies and the variety of thinking and practical use.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor decision-makers, \u003Cstrong\u003Epursuing competency development is a strategic choice\u003C/strong\u003E. It offers powerful opportunities for organization capability, but at the same time it may be worth focusing on other aspects of human resource strategies and organization development first. Competencies need a clear positioning within the design of capability processes, and a clear value from their practice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOur approach consolidates theory and practice and offers a strategic and technically-robust direction for developing and using competencies formally.
