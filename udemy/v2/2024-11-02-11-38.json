This course might become your first step to acquire skill set, knowledges and maybe even a whole new profession, that is appearing right now. Learning it today, gives you advantages tomorrow!  I\u2019m talking about digital transformation. In terms of customer communications in basically any meduim or big enterprises. And for small businesses, the most succesfull ones, they are already doing it in a modern way from the first day.  This transformation - it is a moving away from old way of communications, like phone calls, email, or even fax - to new way - whatsapp, facebook messenger, instagram direct messages, telegram - any messaging apps that people are using in their everyday life. And now they are starting to us\u0443 it to talk to businesses. To chat with an online store, with a bank, medical clinic - with any organization out there.","All of these companies need employees or contractors who understand how to make this shift, this transition. New channels on the one hand bring a lot of new possibilities, such as chatbots and artificial intelligence, and on the other hand, require a rebuilding of current business workflows.  For example agent\u2019s KPI in a contact centre based on whatsapp, is very different from a voice-based CC. And somebody need to know how to deal with it.  But the contact center is not the only place where apps like whatsapp are taking over. It affects pretty much every customer related departpent: sales, marketing and loyalty, support, customer experience, automation and online services.  So, Whether you plan to tie your career or business entirely to this feild, this knowledge will help you achieve your professional goals in a variety of ways. Because communication - is the essential part of business.  I started this journey seven years ago, when it was hardly even existed. Since then, I have worked with some of the world\u0027s biggest clients, such as Societe Generale, British american tobacco and others. Now I\u2019m a founder of a startup called brandy. im  I invite you to my course where you will learn the basics about communications of the future. Welcome!","Before we start I want to give a quick intro of myself and also let\u2019s take a look on the course plan.  So without further ado, here is what we will discuss  The course consists of 2 parts:  In a first one, everything down lesson 4, we are talking about the key benefits for business in general.  And then learning the basics of chatbots and AI.  The second part is becoming more specific.  We will see how exactly it implies to different departments. Discuss business application of particular messaging channels.  And with all of that we are getting ready to meet the main framework \u2013  of ideal customer journey in modern channels. Which will be useful tool to any of your further projects.  And briefly about me.  You can call me Slava. For a last 7 years I\u2019ve been running chat platform startup. For these years we made a lot of stuff, worked with some worldwide clients.  We have become official provider of apple messages for business. Not sure if this is my most significant achievement, but personally, the most pleasant one.

And then, we are going to build general and cool features inside our own app. We are going to build the topics system. And in this section, I am going to show you how to create, update, show, and delete topics in an easy manner. And now that every topic has a reply we are going to build the replies system so users will be allowed to create and update and delete their own replies. After all of this, we are going to move to other parts of the forum and they are general parts that are related to categories, topics, and replies. Also, there is a section where we are going to take care of the profile system. And then we will dive deeper into creating the admin panel.
