The ultimate secret of the course is that we will also tell you about a tool that you can use for unlimited lead-generation using another secretive artificial intelligence\u0026nbsp;(AI) technology. There is often a disconnection between sales and marketing departments in many businesses. This is typically due to a lack of interaction or shared attention. Marketers may give sales a lead they believe to be ideal, but sales are not. It creates tension between two teams to work together, and AI is the perfect way to bring them together. AI can point out positive sales leads, which will also satisfy marketing, and ensure that potential customers are targeted at the right platforms. You don\u0027t want the company that sells accounting software to be advertised by someone. All teams will need to come together and agree on an optimal customer profile, a profile that fits marketing and sales, to better use AI in the B2B lead generation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe profile can consist of multiple variables, such as sector, company level, and how many employees they have. The standards are almost infinite. The AI will use the profile to measure current and potential leads against a selection of pre-defined behavioural criteria. Without us providing all this, the AI will fumble around, essentially throwing darts at a board while blindfolded. The AI can predict future patterns for lead generation, possible spending, and what campaigns or services will draw their interest from this.

Knowledge builds upon the knowledge, so it is always a good idea to learn from other mental health professionals. I share useful analogies, mindset shifts, tools \u0026amp; techniques in this course that you can directly use in your counselling sessions. The resources are in open word format that you can customize according to your needs and share with your clients to track their improvements and make progress.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E__\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHey, everybody Aman Varma (CBT/DBT/ACT) here, I\u0027m a\u003Cstrong\u003E \u003C/strong\u003Ecounsellor and in this course, I will be sharing with you unique insights and some tools that can help you conduct your depressive client counselling in a much more effective way. Throughout my experience of counselling many clients on depression, I have learned something unique, something that nobody else might know so I have decided that I will share with you all those insights all those resources in this course. Now, the thing is that there are some clients that are very difficult to \u0022treat\u0022 in a sense. No matter how much therapy you apply to them, no matter how many tools and techniques you give them they just cannot seem to come out of depression and this affects not only our business but also our objectives as mental health professionals to help people.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if you want to conduct more effective therapy it is very useful to learn and gain insights from people or from counsellors who are doing such things. Getting a lot of different perspectives on the same thing can enhance our skills and can make our counseling much more effective. Sometimes we face \u0022stubborn depressive\u0022 clients, meaning nothing helps them to bounce back. So we can use the experiences of other counsellors in such scenarios. That is what I do too. If i am stuck somewhere with my counseling i often go out and network with other counselors and see if they have come across such a problem and they share their unique insights with me that help me help my clients get out of depression.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo this course is basically me offloading all my insights and my experiences that I have gone through in the past years treating clients with depression and in addition that I was too having depression I had gone through MDD (major depressive disorder) and Cyclothymia. I also share my personal experience my first-hand insight into what depression looks like for a depressed person so you get both the perspectives in this course one of the counsellors and one of a patient or a client and then you can apply those in your practice, you can share those insights with your clients so that they get a broader understanding of themselves of how they should be working towards solving their depression problem. I hope you will enjoy this course, this is a unique course the content in this course is not something that you will find outside because this is all my authentic experiences and insight so I highly suggest you take this course because knowledge builds upon knowledge in some way, shape or form this knowledge will help you in your personal life, in your professional life and also help you boom your business! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope you will consider this course I will see you on the inside :)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAbout Instructor:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAman Varma has undergone accredited course training in CBT practitioner, Diploma in Hypnotherapy, Mental Health Practitioner, NLP Specialist Practitioner, Diploma in Psychological Counseling and Diploma in Modern Applied Psychology.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"Anglais","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/depression-counseling-made-simpler-and-effective-major-despressive/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4420310_71aa_4.jpg","duration":"2,5\u00A0heures","enrolledStudentsCount":"1\u00A0008 participants","lastUpdated":"Derni\u00E8re mise \u00E0 jour\u00A0: 1/2022","targetAudiences":["Psychologists/Counselors  who are having difficulty treating clients with MDD","Psychologists/Counselors who have started a new business and feel unclear how to proceed with MDD clients","Psychologists/Counselors if your practice is ineffective because you lack frameworks, insights, and worksheets for helping clients with MDD","Psychologists/Counselors who have never helped depressive clients"],"tags":["Sant\u00E9 et bien-\u00EAtre","Sant\u00E9 mentale","Aide psychologique"],"rating":{"count":2,"averageValue":"3.9"},"instructors":[{"name":"Psychology Online","url":"/user/cb802548-f70d-45ca-9f85-fd5a02ea9e3e/","totalNumberOfStudents":22805,"totalNumberOfReviews":407,"averageRating":4.12582204949495}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"7D100F7A7AC9E97E9E8F","originalPrice":"5.440\u00A0\u20B9","discountedPrice":"\u00DCcretsiz","expirationText":"4 g\u00FCn","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/corporate-finance-16-convertible-bonds-warrants/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4164824,"title":"Corporate Finance #16 Convertible Bonds \u0026 Warrants","shortDescription":"Learn about convertible bonds, warrants, and derivative securities from a certified public accountant (CPA)","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThis course will cover convertible securities.

Due to its ability to sense, reason, act and adapt, AI has suddenly become one of the most important technologies and the most in-demand tool for the video creation market; and also due to the popularity of automation in different business practices. Several companies have invested in keeping video production as their main target in Artificial Intelligence.

These companies have invested in AI just to make it more exciting and innovative to watch videos. Many aspects of the production and editing process of videos have been handled by artificial intelligence.\u0026nbsp;Its innovation is also a blessing for production teams and video editors.
