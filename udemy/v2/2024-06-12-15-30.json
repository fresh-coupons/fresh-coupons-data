I found this course created by TJ Walker a perfect introduction to the world of media training. I wanted to learn, not only what a media trainer does, but also what steps I would have to take in order to become a successful media trainer--TJ discusses all this in a clear and concise manner, in a tone that is welcoming and never alienating. The only constructive critique I would give would be concerning the technical form of the presentation, more specifically the video quality and picture aesthetic. Going by the current standard as it applies to video, everything we view is in high definition. Having said that, I believe the video quality could be improved upon as well as the backdrop which I found to be a bit generic and outdated. I found these minor flaws to be slightly distracting and given the high caliber of the speaker and the information being presented I believe these aspects detracted, if only marginally, from the quality of the product.\u0022\u0026nbsp;\u003C/em\u003ENick Cisik\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u00225 Stars!

I love that the courses aren\u0027t just pulling numbers from thin air, it actually shows data to back their tactics up. Also, lots of the courses out there talk about high-level marketing strategy, while startup SaaS marketers often have to also know how to execute the strategy as they may be solo marketers in the company. For example, a very hands-on approach to doing ABM on LinkedIn \u002B the software/tools marketers can use are very helpful in the module about ABM marketing. Last but not the least, Dekker introduced many good books (some academic, some easier to read) on the subject matter. I gave 4.5 stars because I figured that the content of each module can be reorganized to be more on-topic (some are a bit repetitive, but I understand that repetition is important in marketing :) ). It would also be great if more SaaS-specific examples can be provided, especially on the topic of PMM\u0027s role in leading product launches, feature updates, etc.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECovenant Chimnonso\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u0022This course has provided me with a different, more advanced view of Product Marketing leadership and a more general view to approaching marketing generally.
