So he is giving us an actual example of the very thing that he is talking about. His expressions and gestures are perfectly suited to the points he is making. And his pronunciation is very clear and easy to understand. Also his sentences are spoken with the emphasis in the right places. This course is designed for native speakers of English. The same basic principles could probably be applied in a course designed for non-native speakers. I would like to see such a course someday. I am really enjoying this course.

The magnitude of material and the pieces of golden wisdom are so practical to today\u0027s environment.

Only one-third through the course and already my Charity fundraising efforts are more effective because I have gained skills to improve my communication, both my message and my delivery. The clarity of TJ Walker\u0027s delivery demonstrates his message in action. Follow him on Facebook and YouTube for greater depth if you find yourself improving from absorbing his work as I have.

Merger: Two companies of relatively similar size combine forces to create a new, single entity. This is often a move for market expansion or gaining a competitive edge.  Acquisition: One company purchases a majority stake or all of another company. The acquiring company gains control of the acquired company\u0027s assets and operations. This can be done to enter new markets, eliminate competition, or gain new technology resources.","Key Pitfalls in M\u0026A  Culture Clash: Combining distinct company cultures can lead to employee conflicts, low morale, and a decline in productivity.  Overpaying: Enthusiasm can lead companies to overpay for an acquisition, resulting in financial losses down the line.  Poor Integration: Failure to smoothly integrate systems, processes, and teams creates operational chaos and hinders the potential of the combined entity.  Lack of Due Diligence: Insufficient research about the target company\u0027s financial health, legal standing, or market position might expose hidden liabilities and risks.  Loss of Focus: The complexity of the M\u0026A process can distract from core business operations, leading to neglected customers or missed opportunities.","Why is Learning About M\u0026A Important for Companies and Managers?  Strategic Growth: M\u0026A can be a powerful tool to expand into new markets, acquire new technologies, eliminate competitors, or increase market share significantly.  Responding to Market Changes Companies must adapt to industry shifts. An M\u0026A strategy can be vital for staying ahead of the competition or even surviving.  Leadership Development: M\u0026A success relies heavily on the ability of managers to navigate complexity, integrate teams, and make crucial decisions under pressure.","How Can M\u0026A Skills Support Career Development?  Increased Demand: As M\u0026A activity continues to be prevalent, professionals with these skills are highly sought after by companies, investment banks, and consulting firms.  Leadership Opportunities: M\u0026A skills signal strategic thinking, problem-solving abilities, and a talent for execution \u2013 all assets for leadership roles.  Broader Skillset: M\u0026A involves exposure to various aspects of business such as finance, valuation, negotiation, and legal, thus developing a more versatile skillset.

It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables.

Dr. N\u00E4si has been doing research on non-professional photography and visual communication for 12 years.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe demand for the course can be noticed because of\u0026nbsp; misbehaviour on basically all social media platforms. Malicious and aggressive remarks, downplaying and insinuations are toxic examples of this. In general, we all participate in everyday photography using our cell phones, but very few of us have a clear structure, logical train of thought and operating model as regards this mundane topic. Understanding increases well-being. In addition, practical self-disclosure tools help manage various online channels and their content. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring the course, Dr. N\u00E4si will summarize the social changes of amateur photography during the last 20-30 years and help understand the shift in the use and role of photography. Thereafter, the power of photographs and their role in building an online identity is explained. What different reasons motive people to take and share photographs? Lastly, based on the increased understanding of the social space and peoples\u0027 behaviour within, the course provides practical tools for better self-disclosure and consideration when it comes to photographic communication in front and behind the camera.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis course provides a comprehensive picture of smartphone photography with its potential and risks from a social point of view.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo welcome, let\u0027s get started!\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/photographers-guide-to-self-disclosure-online/","imageUri":"https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/6010364_42f1_2.jpg","duration":"1.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"773.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Active camera phone users","Social media users, influencers and people working with online marketing","Anyone interested in group dynamics and photographic communication","People with public visual social media accounts","People who have come across inappropriate behaviour online","Those who are considering creating public online profiles for business purposes"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":0,"averageValue":"0.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"Altti N\u00E4si","url":"/user/altti-nasi/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":0}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"JULYPROMOTION","originalPrice":"\u20B91,799","discountedPrice":"\u20B9449","expirationText":"7 hours","discountPercentage":75}}},"freeCourses":{}}
