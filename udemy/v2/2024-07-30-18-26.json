So he is giving us an actual example of the very thing that he is talking about. His expressions and gestures are perfectly suited to the points he is making. And his pronunciation is very clear and easy to understand. Also his sentences are spoken with the emphasis in the right places. This course is designed for native speakers of English. The same basic principles could probably be applied in a course designed for non-native speakers. I would like to see such a course someday. I am really enjoying this course.

This tool makes use of PigLatin language which is used along with Hadoop for data manipulation and their operations. Pig Latin is a high-level language which provides numerous operators using which programmers can develop their functions for reading, writing as well as processing the data. To be able to do data analysis through this tool, the script must be composed using the Pig Latin language. The scripts are then converted to Map and Reduce tasks. Pig Engine accepts the pig Latin scripts as its inputs thereby generating map-reduce jobs. The pig training is best for all the programmers as it ensures that complex pieces of Java code are not required now to execute simple tasks and achieve simple functionality. Instead, it follows a multi-query approach which reduces the lines of code used for programming. Just to compare 200 lines of Java code can be done in 10 lines of PIG code. It is a SQL like a language and therefore users who have SQL like a background are good to go choice for implementing PIG language.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this Apache Pig Training, you will learn about how to make use of Big data tools and technology.
