When developing a java application, it is necessary to interact with hardware devices for input and output requirements. To do that java program makes use of API in io. the package which has a class for each device. Java IO is an API deal with core classes that comes with reading and writing data from the networks. Java IO consists of many subclasses for file access, buffering, network access, filtering, intercommunication, pipes, reading, and writing text. Java IO has two types of streams namely input streams and output streams. They are programming interfaces to the streams. Two general-purpose classes file input stream and file output stream used to copy a file to file. It also has some classes for the file to represent a file, random access files, Tokenizer. file handling in Java is performed by Java IO API. when a user request to process a read a file, a file system determines where the file lives in the drive then it places them in the memory. While talking about Output stream class there are useful methods of output stream respectively with a hierarchy and similar to this is Input streams java io package has object input and object output respectively.

This tool makes use of PigLatin language which is used along with Hadoop for data manipulation and their operations. Pig Latin is a high-level language which provides numerous operators using which programmers can develop their functions for reading, writing as well as processing the data. To be able to do data analysis through this tool, the script must be composed using the Pig Latin language. The scripts are then converted to Map and Reduce tasks. Pig Engine accepts the pig Latin scripts as its inputs thereby generating map-reduce jobs. The pig training is best for all the programmers as it ensures that complex pieces of Java code are not required now to execute simple tasks and achieve simple functionality. Instead, it follows a multi-query approach which reduces the lines of code used for programming. Just to compare 200 lines of Java code can be done in 10 lines of PIG code.
