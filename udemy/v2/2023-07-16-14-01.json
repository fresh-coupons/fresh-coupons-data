You will learn about hashing, how to crack windows password hashes, how to crack linux hashes and about cryptography. Hashing is a process of converting a given input into a fixed-size alphanumeric string. The output of a hash function is often referred to as a message digest or simply, a hash. A good hash function satisfies the following properties: it is easy to compute the hash value for any given message, it is infeasible to generate two different messages that result in the same hash value, it is infeasible to modify a message without changing its hash value, and it is infeasible to determine the original message from its hash value.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWhen used properly, hashing can be an effective way to store sensitive data such as passwords while keeping them safe from prying eyes. This is because even if someone were to obtain the hash value of a password, they would still need to brute force guess the actual password which would be incredibly time consuming (if not impossible) with today\u0027s computing power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter completing this course, you will be able to crack the passwords hashes from a Windows and Linux computer and find all users passwords using hash cracking tools.

It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables.

You can even check who those unknown people are that have been invited. Then, the recording of the call is immediately available in the same tab, so if you missed the meeting, you don\u2019t need to hunt for the recording. It\u2019s right there, with the meeting notes and agreed actions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E3. Fewer Emails: \u003C/strong\u003EDrowning in your emails becomes a thing of the past.

No more sending out different versions through email and the resulting version confusion.

We cover a range of topics, starting from an introduction to cloud computing and cloud service models to cloud server deployment and configuration using Linode. We also explore the foundations of Linux, LAMP stack installation and configuration, server security, and SSL certificates.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe course begins with an introduction to cloud computing and the different service models available, such as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). This offers students a basic understanding of the different types of cloud services available along with various use cases.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ENext, the course delves into server deployment and configuration using Linode. Linode is a popular cloud hosting provider that offers a range of services, including virtual private servers (VPS), storage, and networking. Students will learn how to deploy and configure a virtual instance and use it to host a website or application using LAMP Stack. LAMP stands for Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP and is a popular stack used to build dynamic websites and web applications. Students will learn how to install and configure each component of the stack and use it to create a functional website or web application. The course will then cover Linux foundations, where we explore the Linux file system, basic commands, and user accounts.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn the following section students explore server security, including best practices for securing a server and common security threats. Students will learn about firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and how to secure sensitive data. We will demonstrate how to setup custom ports, hardware firewalls, and software firewalls using UFW.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EFinally, the course will cover installing and configuring SSL certificates. SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is a standard security technology for establishing an encrypted link between a web server and a browser.

course offers an in-depth overview of the foundations of one of the most powerful image editing software applications available: Adobe Lightroom Classic CC. We start right from the ground up, where students will learn to navigate the Lightroom interface, create image catalogs and import hundreds of images for the purpose of sorting and organizing photo collections. Here we will explore important concepts such as catalog settings, import file handling, auto renaming, metadata presets, and import preferences. Once students are familiar with the basics, we take a theoretical dive into a number of concepts and key terms that are essential in the photography and digital image editing arena. Here we will explore various file formats, color spaces, image resolution, pixel density, and much more. From there, we transition back to completing application setup by exploring file handling options, interface preferences, identity plate setup, and watermarking with both text and graphics.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOnce we\u2019ve covered the foundations, students will take a deep dive into the Lightroom Library Module. The library module is an integral part of the Lightroom application, which is used for a number of important functions. This includes populating, sorting, and organizing image collection sets. This section starts from the basics, where we explore the Library interface. From there, students learn to filter files, paint keywords, and generate keyword sets. We\u2019ll also demonstrate how to use various library views for image comparison, and advanced sorting. Once students have a handle of the foundations, we cover more intermediate sorting techniques using star ratings, pick and reject flags, color labels, and smart collections. We then transition to working with the library attribute filter, adding folders, building smart previews, and an overview of the quick develop panel for basic image enhancements.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAs you can see this course covers a number of topics that are essential to anyone starting off in the digital image enhancement arena. It\u2019s also a great resource for both professional and aspiring photographers that are looking to take their existing shots to the next level.
