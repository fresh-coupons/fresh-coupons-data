Exploring this topic is as challenging as it is interesting. But while there may exist many depictions and images on temples and tomb walls that describe in detail the pharaonic home and kitchen, as well as the kinds of foods offered on almost all occasions from the dawn of the Predynastic era, the ancient Egyptians did not leave behind any recipes. As such it remains difficult, as one can imagine,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eto specify weights, measurements, and methods of preparation with any clear precision.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDue to the specific cultural heritage of each area, ways of cooking may differ from one place to another, helping to individualize that region despite the similarity of ingredients. In Lower Egypt, or the Delta, for example, there has been a consecutive influence of Greeks and Romans, foreign immigration, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of these have directly impacted food and cooking habits as well as recipe variations, and the modern Egyptian kitchen in this region is the outcome of these influences.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut this has not been the case with southern Egypt (Upper Egypt and Nubia), where cooking methods and ingredients have likely remained\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eunchanged since the days of the pharaohs due to the relative lack of foreign influences in the area. Very early on in the project it quickly became apparent that cooking methods in Upper Egypt and Nubia\u2014regions that have always been strongly insular, adhering closely to ancient cultures and inherited traditions\u2014have retained a pharaonic influence in their simplicity, their tendency to use few ingredients and spices, and their preference for vegetables, grains, spices, and herbs indigenous to the region. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Es noted earlier, the ancient Egyptians left few if any recipes, so the ingredients in this course have been slightly modified to suit modern tastes. While certain foods were not introduced into Egypt until after the pharaonic age (including sugar, lemon, tomatoes, chicken, and chilli, among others), they have found their way into the modern-day southern Egyptian kitchen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Pharaoh\u2019s Kitchen has been compiled with the aim of thoroughly exploring ancient Egyptian cooking, from both historical and social perspectives. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003EHome and Kitchen Pharaonic Homes \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E A\u003C/strong\u003Encient Egyptian houses differed according to the social and economic class of their residents, ranging from small, basic structures for peasants and laborers to more elaborate homes for artists, priests, and men of state, villas for nobles, and palaces for kings. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKitchen Planning and Cooking Tools \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehe kitchen was located at the back of the house and would be covered by a roof of straw or branches to simultaneously block out the scorching Egyptian heat and allow the escape of cooking fumes. In villas, the kitchen was located entirely outside the house. A grain storehouse would serve the kitchen, sometimes being located alongside it or on the roof where it could be reached by stairs.The kitchen area would be constructed along simple lines. In one corner there would be an oven covered in a layer of mud or a stove. There would also be one or two stone structures for the grinding of grains, or a tool \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPots and Vessels\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAncient Egyptians used the rich soil of the Nile bank to make pottery.

Food sources were diverse, and ancient Egyptians made good use of the different kinds of fish, vegetables, poultry, and fruits. The staple diet of most Egyptians consisted of bread and beer in addition to what produce the land yielded, such as onions, garlic, lentils, leeks, turnips, radish, lettuce, and cucumbers. Since the Predynastic period, ancient Egyptians, rich or poor, consumed various breads made from different grains. Flour would generally be mixed with a yeasting agent, salt, and spices, and sometimes with eggs and butter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe bread could also be filled with legumes or vegetables or sweetened with honey or dates. The ancient Egyptians also used a fair share of legumes such as beans, chickpeas, and lentils as well as vegetables such as peas, lettuce, garlic, onions, and leeks. Dates were the most common fruit, in addition to figs, grapes, pomegranates, watermelon and plums, all of which appear in depictions of daily life dating back to the New Kingdom. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFood and Social Status\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETypes of food eaten give a clearer picture of the different social levels in the ancient Egyptian hierarchy.

Ancient Egyptians were easily satisfied with a few loaves of bread, a share of beer, some leeks, and onions. The numerous tomb reliefs that picture the many pleasures of food and drink were probably more indicative of the lives of the upper strata of society, like the higher civil servants, priests, landowners, and nobles. The masses would wait for feasts and special occasions for an excuse to indulge. They likely did not have to wait long as festivals were numerous, judging by the annual special occasions relating to the seasons, the Nile, sowing, harvesting, as well as coronations and funerals \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFood and the Gods\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ancient Egyptians identified spiritually with the forces of nature surrounding them, including the sun, moon, wind, the inundation of the Nile, the strength of fierce animals like lions, snakes, and crocodiles, or powerful animals that were of use to them like cows and bulls. There were many gods, one for each invisible force behind the phenomenon, thus becoming intertwined with the lives of the ancient Egyptians. They did not only worship tangible powers, but also less tangible ones symbolized by animals. For example, the force of wisdom was symbolized by the ibis of Thoth, and fertility by the bull.26 The deification of animals made them a symbol for a certain god or power, but it did not stop the ancients from using them for food, transport, or other purposes. Thus the cow was used for farming, and though the ancient Egyptians deified the crocodile, they didn\u2019t find anything \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Efood and language\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe hieroglyphs used by the ancients were numerous and pictorial: symbols of people, animals, tools and implements, as well as food items. The foods were not chosen randomly, but in fact were built on the importance of that symbol to the lives of the ancient Egyptians. Among the twenty-four letters of the ancient Egyptian alphabet, four are related to food: I was represented by a leaf of a plant. N was represented by water, the source of life.

Ancient Egyptians raised sheep and cows for irtet (milk), from which they made cheese, butter, and cream. To increase the animals\u2019 milk production, the ancient Egyptians set proper feeding habits and forbade the use of female animals in agriculture. The peasants themselves were careful to ensure that milking occurred in an atmosphere of calmness and safety. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDairy Products in Modern-day Upper Egypt\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECottage cheese, butter, and ghee, which was called seimi (from which came the name ghee in modern Egyptian, samna) are still used in Upper Egypt today.

They made use of grazing lands that conveniently grew naturally in the swamps of the fertile Delta and the pastures that would appear after the Nile flood and would last for a few months. They also knew how to raise many animals such as bulls, cows, sheep, and goats. Tomb reliefs show many scenes of slaughtering animals, especially bulls, which, in addition to their much-coveted meat, were used for agricultural purposes such as ploughing the land and crushing corn as well as pulling heavy loads such as construction blocks. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPoultry\u003C/strong\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eas one of the main sources of food for ancient Egyptians, varying, as is the case today, from domesticated fowl to wild birds.

Quail, swans, sparrows, storks, and pigeons were fair game. Several methods were used to hunt birds. Boomerangs were known since the Predynastic period and were used in hunting swamp birds. Hunters hid in the rushes, waiting for the precise moment at which they could capture the bird by flinging their boomerangs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFish \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehe Nile was the backbone of ancient Egyptian life, providing water\u2014 both for drinking and agriculture\u2014a means of transport, and communication. There was an abundance of fish thriving in its waters. Many different varieties were available and the flooding of the Nile meant large catches that had to be preserved for storage by salting and drying. In some parts of the country, there were fish that were considered sacred, and couldn\u2019t be caught or eaten, like Nile perch or seasnake.

A rod would be pushed through the mouth and the fish would be grilled over a fire. Fish could also be boiled in a pot filled with water, salt, and some spices. Certain kinds of fish were also smoked and salted. Salting was a convenient way to cook fish to avoid spoilage, especially in the hot weather, as it would keep fish edible for a very long time.

Of the most commonly cultivated were onions which were also used in medicinal recipes as well as on special occasions. Known as a popular food for layman as well as priest, onions were commonly used to flavor dishes. Herodotus even mentioned onions and bread as the staple diet for pyramid builders. Apicius reports that onion was used as an ingredient in a sauce for grilled fish.

Onions, which were eaten raw, comprised a large portion of the ancient Egyptians\u2019 vegetable intake, and it is believed the ancients ate many of their vegetables raw.

Types of legumes consumed were beans, peas, chickpeas, crushed wheat, lentils, lupine beans and fenugreek. Herodotus mentioned that lentils were eaten by pyramid builders in the Old Kingdom. They were also used to make bread and as feed for animals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFound in the tombs of the Fifth Dynasty were eyorti (Egyptian beans), a name similar to the one used in Egypt now, herati. The ancient Egyptians cooked different kinds of beans in various ways. Beans were cooked the same way as peas and were also used in making besara. The latter was prepared by boiling crushed beans, mashing them into a smooth thick paste, then adding spices and herbs such as cumin, dry and fresh coriander, salt, parsley, and dry Jew\u2019s mallow.

Melon was also often planted. Dates were eaten either fresh, or dried, and a type of wine was made out of them, just like the fig, which was also a popular fruit, eaten both fresh and pressed into wine.
