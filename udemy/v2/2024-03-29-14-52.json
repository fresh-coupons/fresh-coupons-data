This Microcontroller is called\u0026nbsp;DigiSpark.\u0026nbsp;It is a microcontroller\u0026nbsp;based on the Attiny85 development board.

An Expert hacker with a few minutes, photographic memory,\u0026nbsp; and perfect typing accuracy can use a few well-crafted keystrokes to hack virtually anything they have physical access to. However, the proper hardware can do the same thing every time on demand without fail.\u0026nbsp; That\u2019s where the Rubber Ducky and other Human Interface Devices (HID)\u0026nbsp; come into play. They inject keystrokes at superhuman speeds, violating computers\u0027 inherent trust in humans by posing as a keyboard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this class, we\u2019ll learn more about what HID attacks are, how they work,\u0026nbsp; the social engineering that can be involved in their deployment, and how to use them in your Pen-testing engagements. Keyboards announce themselves to computers as HID devices and are in turn automatically recognized and accepted. We\u0027ll program a microcontroller in Arduino to take advantage of this by acting as an HID device. We can then create scripts that run when the device is plugged into a target computer. All at only a fraction of the cost of the more well-branded USB Rubber\u0026nbsp; Ducky!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStudents will learn to use a low-cost Digispark to program their payloads for use in Ethical Hacking and Penetration testing. We\u0027ll go over creating more advanced loads, including tracking payloads that run in the background, as well as Rickroll payloads that can be used with permission from friends and family to demonstrate how HID attacks work. Additionally, students learn to automate nearly anything on an unattended device which can be extremely useful when you need to run the same commands on a series of computers.\u0026nbsp; That\u2019s how the Original USB Ruber Ducky was invented. Hak5 founder\u0026nbsp; Darren Kitchen, while working as a sysadmin, got tired of typing the same commands to fix printers and network shares, again and again, and the device evolved out of laziness. He programmed a development board to emulate the typing for him - and thus the keystroke injection attack was born.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0647\u0644 \u0635\u0646\u0627\u0639\u0647 \u062C\u0647\u0627\u0632 \u0631\u0627\u0628\u0631 \u062F\u0643\u064A\u061F\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u062F\u0639\u0646\u0627 \u0646\u062A\u0639\u0631\u0641 \u0639\u0644\u0649\u0026nbsp;

I love that the courses aren\u0027t just pulling numbers from thin air, it actually shows data to back their tactics up. Also, lots of the courses out there talk about high-level marketing strategy, while startup SaaS marketers often have to also know how to execute the strategy as they may be solo marketers in the company. For example, a very hands-on approach to doing ABM on LinkedIn \u002B the software/tools marketers can use are very helpful in the module about ABM marketing. Last but not the least, Dekker introduced many good books (some academic, some easier to read) on the subject matter. I gave 4.5 stars because I figured that the content of each module can be reorganized to be more on-topic (some are a bit repetitive, but I understand that repetition is important in marketing :) ). It would also be great if more SaaS-specific examples can be provided, especially on the topic of PMM\u0027s role in leading product launches, feature updates, etc.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECovenant Chimnonso\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u0022This course has provided me with a different, more advanced view of Product Marketing leadership and a more general view to approaching marketing generally.
