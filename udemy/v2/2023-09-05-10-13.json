We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables.

These environments, which combine in-office and remote work, have become the new normal for many organizations. As a result, Human Resources (HR) professionals find themselves facing unique challenges and opportunities in managing a dispersed workforce. To navigate this evolving landscape effectively, HR professionals need to equip themselves with specialized knowledge and skills.

As we move beyond the pandemic, many organizations have decided to maintain a hybrid work model, recognizing its benefits for both employees and employers. Hybrid work offers flexibility, increased productivity, and the ability to tap into a global talent pool. However, it also presents unique challenges related to communication, engagement, and employee well-being.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe future of work is undeniably hybrid, and HR professionals must adapt to this new reality.

You will also be taught how to identify, exploit and prevent each vulnerability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Command Execution Vulnerability:Command injection is an attack in which the goal is execution of arbitrary commands on the host operating system via a vulnerable application. Command injection attacks are possible when an application passes unsafe user supplied data (forms, cookies, HTTP headers etc.) to a system shell. In this attack, the attacker-supplied operating system commands are usually executed with the privileges of the vulnerable application. Command injection attacks are possible largely due to insufficient input validation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-File Inclusion Vulnerability:allows an attacker to include a file, usually exploiting a \u201Cdynamic file inclusion\u201D mechanisms implemented in the target application. The vulnerability occurs due to the use of user-supplied input without proper validation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-File Upload Vulnerability:Uploaded files represent a significant risk to applications. The first step in many attacks is to get some code to the system to be attacked. Then the attack only needs to find a way to get the code executed. Using a file upload helps the attacker accomplish the first step.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe consequences of unrestricted file upload can vary, including complete system takeover, an overloaded file system or database, forwarding attacks to back-end systems, client-side attacks, or simple defacement. It depends on what the application does with the uploaded file and especially where it is stored.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are really two classes of problems here. The first is with the file metadata, like the path and file name. These are generally provided by the transport, such as HTTP multi-part encoding. This data may trick the application into overwriting a critical file or storing the file in a bad location. You must validate the metadata extremely carefully before using it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other class of problem is with the file size or content. The range of problems here depends entirely on what the file is used for. See the examples below for some ideas about how files might be misused. To protect against this type of attack, you should analyse everything your application does with files and think carefully about what processing and interpreters are involved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESQL Injection Vulnerability:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESQL injection attacks allow attackers to spoof identity, tamper with existing data, cause repudiation issues such as voiding transactions or changing balances, allow the complete disclosure of all data on the system, destroy the data or make it otherwise unavailable, and become administrators of the database server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESQL Injection is very common with PHP and ASP applications due to the prevalence of older functional interfaces. Due to the nature of programmatic interfaces available, J2EE and ASP.NET applications are less likely to have easily exploited SQL injections.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe severity of SQL Injection attacks is limited by the attacker\u2019s skill and imagination, and to a lesser extent, defense in depth countermeasures, such as low privilege connections to the database server and so on.
