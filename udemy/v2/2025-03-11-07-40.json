This term was coined in the early 1990s with the basic concept that positive personal transformation can occur in the aftermath of trauma\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are many good courses already available to help people cope with the symptoms of trauma and PTSD.

This course is for those who wish to go beyond being resilient, to experience meaningful personal growth and perhaps radical transformation in the aftermath of a trauma.

From the ancient Greeks to today, tragedy has been a common theme in many great works of literature. It is also an essential ingredient in soap operas, movies, novels, and the stories people love. Perhaps the enduring appeal of these stories for most of us is that they teach the lessons of suffering without our having to experience the pain directly\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou may wonder, what if I have PTSD? How can I move toward posttraumatic growth if I am struggling with PTSD? The truth is that the same challenges that create PTSD also set the stage for a psychological rebirth. In the aftermath of trauma, what was once an understandable reality has now become mystifying. You have difficulty navigating the strange new life you find yourself living. This difficulty produces the classic symptoms of PTSD: a self-protective posture toward life that is essentially automatic, treating the world as an unsafe place. Being easily startled, having nightmares, feeling emotionally numb, having flashbacks to traumatic events, and feeling mistrustful are all part of this self-protective reaction\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut these shocking challenges to the usual way of living can also set in motion an exploration of new ways of living that becomes PTSD growth. Some people may experience symptoms of PTSD and posttraumatic growth at the same time. This is one of the paradoxes of PTSD growth\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou have likely picked up this course because this idea attracted you. If you have to go through the tragedy and loss of trauma, why not make sure there is something worthwhile in the end?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this course, we hope that you will find a pathway to personal transformation as well. We are eager to share with you the wisdom of other trauma survivors, their accomplishments, and the ways we have devised to encourage the process of PTSD growth. Because of the focus on PTSD growth, this course is different from others that you will find on trauma recovery, posttraumatic stress disorder, and the like.

It assumes that you\u0027re new to the language, so it gets you started with basic functionality such as creating functions, creating variables, and calling these lines of code from your standard HTML pages. It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E*\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E javascript course contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript introduction\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript array\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript variables\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript functions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript objects\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript control statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript cookies\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript loop statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript data structures\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript error handling\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript regular expressions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESection 4- python programming language.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis course section provides an introduction to programming and the python language. students are introduced to core python programming concepts like conditionals, loops, variables, and functions. this section includes an overview of the various python aspects.
