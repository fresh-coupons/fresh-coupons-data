(All the Books of the Bible) That passion drew me to seriously consider his engaging presentation. The instructor challenged me to see myself through the eyes of my Lord and Savior - not the eyes of the world! I learned many valuable teachings about the Book of Philippians by taking this course. That is a credit to the instructor preparing a very detailed and organized course that is easy to follow. The course provided me the opportunity to reflect on my walk with the Lord, and my lack of commitment to thoroughly read and learn from God\u0027s written word on a daily basis. I will never find my true path (God\u0027s will for my life) if I remain a lukewarm Bible studying believer in the Lord, Jesus Christ! It is impossible for a born again Christian to seldom study the Bible, pray without ceasing or draw closer to God in a reconciled relationship while following the secular world. This course has reignited the fire that once was within me to learn from the Bible daily. I praise the Lord for Boomy Tokan who followed the Holy Spirit\u0027s prompting in preparing and sharing this course. I look forward to taking the other courses that Boomy has prepared. Thank you, Lord, for guiding me to this course, which has provided me with a much deeper spiritual understanding of the Book of Philippians.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EI trust you will also partake of what the SPIRIT of GOD wants to communicate to you\u003C/strong\u003E as you embark upon this study.

Even if you\u2019re just looking to build profile, you need a strong internet presence, if you want people to know you exist. The purpose of Digital Marketing is to raise awareness, connect with people who are interested in what you\u2019re offering, and persuade them to take actions you want. It uses digital forms of communication like the web, smartphones, social media platforms, and search engines, as a medium to reach potential customers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust like traditional marketing, digital marketing, is about finding prospective customers and broadcasting your message to them in the right place, in the right tone, and at the right time. Digital Marketing has one major advantage over traditional marketing as you can use analytics tools to monitor your campaigns in real time, so you can swiftly adjust your approach. Typically, it would cost more and take longer to make these kinds of adjustments, but with Digital Marketing it\u2019s easier to course correct than it would be if you had invested in a print ad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWHAT IS SOCIAL MEDIA?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESocial Media is an umbrella term to describe online platforms focused on community-based communication, such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Platforms like this use content sharing and post interaction, and most of there is content produced being from the users not the owners of the platform. Social media also includes curation sites such as wikis, as well as professional networking platforms like LinkedIn. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDue to the massive reach of Social Media, good social media marketing skills are now essential for anyone looking to attract the maximum number of customers online.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWHAT IS SEO?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESEO, or Search engine optimisation, is the science of attracting specific types of traffic to a website using a search engine. To master SEO, you need to create high-value content with high authority backlinks and include keywords in that content that your ideal customers search for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESEO is never a one size fits all solution, to be successful, you must take a bespoke approach. That means you need to optimise your site for the type of search engine you want it to rank highly on, like Google, Amazon, or Bing. SEO typically focuses on scoring highly organic search results, not paid or sponsored traffic, but you can also use it in paid ads, to maximise their reach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs search engines attempt to give the most suitable answer to each person\u2019s search query, you must ensure a search engine views your site as the most appropriate match. Every search engine uses a different algorithm to determine what the best result to a search query is. This will include a combination of different factors, including the quality of your content and backlinks, how many visitors your site has, and your website\u2019s speed and uptime.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModern SEO is complex, and mastering it takes more than just getting the right meta tags. It includes understanding how rich snippets, video, and featured snippets work to enhance your rankings as well as the importance of voice search and Video SEO. If you want to be successful using Google Search, you also need to understand how Google Rank Brain scores your website and must optimise your site to score highly on Google\u2019s algorithm.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELocal SEO is also becoming more critical, and you will need to learn the basics of this, especially since nearly half of all Google searches now have a local intent. Near Me searches have grown even faster, exploding at a rate of 150% more than local searches alone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMastering SEO also includes understanding Technical SEO, which focuses on priming your website for crawling and indexing by search engines.

Your job as a marketer is to emphasise these pain points but in a way that hints YOU can provide the solution. To find out your potential customer\u2019s pain points, you must do market research on your target demographic, to identify their fears, desires, and needs. Market research doesn\u2019t have to be conventional, if your typical customer hangs on out Reddit, why not monitor what they post about and use this to make your copy hold more appeal? When you stress customer\u2019s pain points, you should also highlight the importance of immediate action.

To master SEO, you need to create high-value content with high authority backlinks and include keywords in that content that your ideal customers search for. SEO is never a one size fits all solution, to be successful, you must take a bespoke approach. SEO typically focuses on scoring highly organic search results, not paid or sponsored traffic, but you can also use it in paid ads, to maximise their reach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs search engines attempt to give the most suitable answer to each person\u2019s search query, you must ensure a search engine views your site as the most appropriate match. Every search engine uses a different algorithm to determine what the best result to a search query is. This will include a combination of different factors, including the quality of your content and backlinks, how many visitors your site has, and your website\u2019s speed and uptime.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModern SEO is complex, and mastering it takes more than just getting the right meta tags.

It assumes that you\u0027re new to the language, so it gets you started with basic functionality such as creating functions, creating variables, and calling these lines of code from your standard HTML pages. It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E*\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E javascript course contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript introduction\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript array\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript variables\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript functions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript objects\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript control statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript cookies\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript loop statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript data structures\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript error handling\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript regular expressions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003Esection 3- learn PHP\u0026nbsp;programming language\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis section will learn the basic structure of a web application and how a web browser interacts with a web server.

Ethical hacking is performed by penetration testers and thus has similarities with penetration testing, vulnerability assessment, and social engineering.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe objective of ethical hacking is often to identify system weaknesses that could be exploited by a malicious attacker or criminal, or even identify potential damage that could be caused by an accidental system failure, before a real-world attack occurs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo accomplish this objective, the ethical hacker typically performs four basic types of tasks: system discovery, documentation and analysis, system exploitation, and system defense. The outcome of a test is often a report that describes how an organization can better secure their systems from real-world attacks and accidents.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this course you will learn about exploitation using a password cracker. You will program three different password crackers using the Python programming language. This is a beginners course but it\u0027s recommended that you already programmed with Python.

Hashing is one of the corner stones of cyber security and knowing how to crack hashes is essential for Ethical Hackers. Many passwords are stored in a hash format, the hash function is used in many places including for Windows passwords, Linux passwords and often for databases of web apps. Database leaks often contain password hashes, but what to do with them? You can crack them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are many tools which you can use for hash cracking, one of them is John the Ripper. John the ripper is a fast password cracker, currently available for many flavors of Unix and Windows. The program uses word mangling, permutations, pattern matching, and some other tricks. John runs on multiple operating systems. It\u0027s also highly multithreaded and can make use of multiprocessor systems, which means it can make use of the complete power of your server cluster. In this course we\u0027ll also cover some other tools for hash cracking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this Ethical Hacking course you will learn how to crack various hashes including Windows password hashes and all the common hash formats.
