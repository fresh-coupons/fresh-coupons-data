At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E*\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E javascript course contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript introduction\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript array\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript variables\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript functions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript objects\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript control statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript cookies\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript loop statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript data structures\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript error handling\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript regular expressions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003Esection 4- learn PHP\u0026nbsp;programming language\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis section will learn the basic structure of a web application and how a web browser interacts with a web server.

By examining the revenue generated and the costs incurred on a per-unit basis, experts and companies can evaluate if they are making money or losing it with each sale or customer acquisition.  Scaling Decisions: Understanding unit economics is vital for making informed decisions about scaling a business. If the cost to acquire a customer is higher than the revenue generated from that customer over time, it may not be sustainable to scale the business without making changes.","Business Model Optimization: Unit economics analysis allows experts and companies to identify areas for optimization. It helps in finding cost-effective ways to acquire and retain customers, reduce operational costs, and increase average revenue per unit.  Investor Confidence: For startups and growing companies, demonstrating positive unit economics is often essential to attract investors. It shows that the business model is sound and has the potential for long-term profitability.  Risk Management: By understanding unit economics, companies can identify potential risks early. If the per-unit cost is too high, it may lead to financial instability or bankruptcy in the long run.","Pricing Strategies: Unit economics are key in setting appropriate pricing for products or services. Companies can determine the right balance between pricing and costs to maximize profitability.  Strategic Decision-Making: Business decisions related to product development, marketing campaigns, and resource allocation should be guided by a deep understanding of unit economics. It helps in focusing resources on high-impact areas.","Developing skills related to unit economics can be highly beneficial for building a career in various fields, including business, finance, and entrepreneurship:  Entrepreneurship: Entrepreneurs who understand unit economics can create and refine business models that are more likely to succeed. This knowledge is crucial for securing funding and effectively managing their startups.  Finance and Investment: Professionals in finance and investment need to evaluate the financial health of companies. An understanding of unit economics helps them assess the viability of potential investments.  Marketing and Sales: Marketers can make informed decisions about customer acquisition channels and campaigns based on the cost to acquire a customer and the customer\u0027s lifetime value. Sales teams can prioritize high-value leads.","Operations and Supply Chain Management: Professionals in operations and supply chain management can optimize processes, reduce costs, and improve efficiency by analyzing the unit economics of production and distribution.  Consulting and Advisory Roles: Consultants and advisors who can help companies optimize their unit economics are highly sought after. They can provide valuable insights and recommendations.  Unit economics is a critical aspect of business strategy and financial analysis. Learning about unit economics is essential for making informed decisions, ensuring a sustainable business model, and building a successful career in various fields related to business and finance."],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":6,"averageValue":"4.2"},"instructors":[{"name":"MTF Institute of Management, Technology and Finance","url":"/user/mtfinstitute/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.3333335}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"3C619421E0865F342319","originalPrice":"\u20B91,699","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/premiere-pro-video-editing-basics-to-master-adobe-premiere/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5511636,"title":"Premiere Pro: Video editing Basics to Master- adobe premiere","shortDescription":"Feel free take Premiere Pro course, All Video Editing are very well explained in Hindi.

Does it impact your life and your money? Well, all that I would say is, \u201CIf you can\u2019t negotiate effectively with people, you shouldn\u2019t buy/sell anything for more than a few dollars.\u201D\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason I say this is because regardless of the type of work we do, knowing how to negotiate effectively can greatly impact our success and our satisfaction. Wondering how? I will tell you how\u2026 but before that let me remind you how often you negotiate in life. From childhood, you must have practiced the art of negotiation \u2013 Bedtime, a treat, a promotion, a raise, an extended deadline. Yet you are not good at negotiations. Why? Does it demand a different level of intellect and expertise? Well, I will say \u201CNo\u201D to the former and \u201CYes\u201D to the latter. There are some techniques and a process when put into practice enable you to save thousands of dollars, but unfortunately, no one has told you about these techniques yet, and hence, you are missing out. And by this time, I am sure you must have figured out what I am doing here. I am here to help you uncover all these techniques in this course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt may be\u2026or may not be difficult for you to digest the fact that we all negotiate on a daily basis. On a personal level, we negotiate with friends, family, landlords, car sellers, and employers, among others. We come across hundreds of situations that put our negotiation skills to the test. Whether buying a house or car, reviewing your salary with your boss, or deliberating contracts for your business, your success in each of\u003Cstrong\u003E \u003C/strong\u003Ethese activities will be heavily dependent on your ability to negotiate. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut how come I am speaking so highly of negotiation skills? Well, I\u0027ve spent thousands of hours reading books, articles, and videos and doing real-life research aiming to master negotiation conversations. And now, I want my learnings to benefit you so that you don\u2019t need to chart the long road which I have trodden. I want my long road to be your shortcut and hence, I have created a \u003Cstrong\u003E7-step model \u201CN.E.U.R.O Negotiation System\u003C/strong\u003E\u201D. Combining the principles of Evolution and Brain Science, this program demystifies the science of negotiation like nothing else. This course will help you prepare for and conduct real-world negotiations, from personal to professional, small to large, and daily to extraordinary. You won\u2019t be able to find anything else even one-hundredth as valuable and jaw-dropping. If you get it, please feel free to revert to me.

You\u2019ve been re-assigned, transferred, promoted, demoted, or the big one: fired. Any of these work changes offers you an opportunity to assess what you are doing and what you really want to explore. Maybe there is an occupation that you\u2019ve always wanted to try but fear popped up?

How do you deal with their feelings?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny change begins with a decision. The economy has changed. Our customers want something different. The cultural is evolving. There are any number of reasons why people decide that they or their business must change. Decisions are about change. In fact, the Wall Street Journal tells us that we make 35,000 decisions a day. Admittedly, a lot of them are insignificant such as what flavor ice cream would you choose. But some decisions or changes could affect the future of our businesses, our income, even our lives. Major decisions should be made by tapping into a wide variety of resources and perhaps people. This entails being open to opinions, data, analysis that my differ from our beliefs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESometimes we think we are embracing change but for how long?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake the example of self-help books.

You think that whatever you\u2019re going to get in life or work: better job, more money, new life partner or spouse. A new line of work entirely. It may come with higher pay but it may entail more hours at the office. Increased responsibilities like having to hire and fire people. The change sounded good in theory, but the reality could be different.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPeople might be jealous to your good fortune.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow will others react to your change in your status?
