It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables.

Despite the fact that the concept of neuroplasticity is quite new, it is one of the most important discoveries in neuroscience. The fact is that neural networks are not fixed, but occurring and disappearing dynamically throughout our whole life, depending on experiences. While we repeatedly practice one activity such as a sequence of movements or a mathematical problem, neuronal circuits are being formed, leading to better ability to perform the practiced task with less waste of energy. Once we stop practicing a certain activity, the brain will redirect these neuronal circuits by a much known \u0027use it or lose it\u2019 principle.

These disorders are afflicting almost one in every six individuals throughout the world. Yet, training needs surveys conducted in different parts of the world, especially in low and middle income countries, found that mental health professionals do not have access to training in the delivery of CBT.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECBT is a type of talking treatment that focuses on how your thoughts, beliefs and attitudes affect your feelings and behavior, and teaches you coping skills for dealing with different problems. It combines cognitive\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpon completion of this training, participants will be able to: Accurately assess if CBT is a relevant/indicated intervention, Conceptualize a case from a CBT framework, Demonstrate appropriate application of introductory CBT techniques, Address common stumbling blocks/challenges \uF0B7 Tailor interactions to meet the needs of the person receiving services where they are \uF0B7 Incorporate recovery and culture into treatment plans\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECBT is based on the idea that the way we think about situations can affect the way we feel and behave. For example, if you interpret a situation negatively then you might experience negative emotions as a result, and those bad feelings might then lead you to behave in a certain way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn CBT you work with a therapist to identify and challenge any negative thinking patterns and behaviour which may be causing you difficulties. In turn this can change the way you feel about situations, and enable you to change your behaviour in future. You and your therapist might focus on what is going on in your life right now, but you might also look at your past, and think about how your past experiences impact the way you see the world.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"Englisch","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/cbt-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-for-anxiety-and-depression/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4455066_9f98_2.jpg","duration":"4,5 Stunden","enrolledStudentsCount":"142 Teilnehmer","lastUpdated":"Zuletzt aktualisiert: 12/2021","targetAudiences":["Anyone who is interested in CBT","Anyone who has the passion for learning"],"tags":["Pers\u00F6nliche Entwicklung","Sonstiges in Pers\u00F6nliche Entwicklung","Kognitive Verhaltenstherapie (CBT)"],"rating":null,"instructors":[{"name":"BS Academy","url":"/user/tarek-barakat-6/","totalNumberOfStudents":5445,"totalNumberOfReviews":12,"averageRating":4.497289935294117}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"F91ADEF98855394652B4","originalPrice":"4.480\u00A0\u20B9","discountedPrice":"380\u00A0\u20B9","expirationText":"2 Tage","discountPercentage":92}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/introduction-to-computer-science-with-python/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":3542398,"title":"Build A Search Engine With Python: Computer Science \u0026 Python","shortDescription":"AStateOfData.Com\u2122 Computer Science With Python - Build A Search Engine With Python: Computer Science \u0026 Python","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EAStateOfData.Com\u2122 Computer Science With Python: An Absolute Beginners Guide To Computer Science\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIntroduction\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWHY THIS COURSE IS DIFFERENT?\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany of the online courses teach you to code but not the theory/way of thinking behind it why would we choose a while but not a for loop, why should we pass 2 parameters to a function but not only one? \u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis course will teach you how to think about solving coding problems throughout quizzes, there are 112 video format quizzes that aim to keep you engaged with the course and teach you the Python fundamentals in an easy to follow manner\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMEET THE INSTRUCTOR\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe provide a platform for thousands of people to expand the understanding of programming and computer science.
