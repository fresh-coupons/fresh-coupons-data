Even if you\u2019re just looking to build profile, you need a strong internet presence, if you want people to know you exist. The purpose of Digital Marketing is to raise awareness, connect with people who are interested in what you\u2019re offering, and persuade them to take actions you want. It uses digital forms of communication, like the web, smartphones, social media platforms, and search engines, as a medium to reach potential customers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust like traditional marketing, digital marketing is about finding prospective customers and broadcasting your message to them in the right place, in the right tone, and at the right time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDigital Marketing has one major advantage over traditional marketing, as you can use analytics tools to monitor your campaigns in real time, so you can swiftly adjust your approach. Typically, it would cost more and take longer to make these kinds of adjustments, but with Digital Marketing it\u2019s easier to course correct than it would be if you\u2019d invested in a print ad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat is Social Media?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESocial Media is an umbrella term to describe online platforms focused on community-based communication, such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Platforms like this use content sharing and post interaction, and most content is produced from the users, not the owners of the platform. Social media also includes curation sites such as Wikis, as well as professional networking platforms like LinkedIn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDue to the massive reach of Social Media, good social media marketing skills are now \u003Cem\u003Eessential \u003C/em\u003Efor anyone looking to attract the maximum number of customers online.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat is SEO?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESEO, or Search engine optimization, is the science of attracting specific types of traffic to a website, using a search engine. To master SEO, you need to create high-value content with high authority backlinks, and include keywords in that content that your ideal customers search for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESEO is never a one size fits all solution. To be successful, you must take a bespoke approach. That means you need to optimise your site for the type of search engine you want it to rank highly on, like Google, Amazon, or Bing. SEO typically focuses on scoring highly organic search results, not paid or sponsored traffic. You can also use it in paid ads, to maximise their reach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs search engines attempt to give the most suitable answer to each person\u2019s search query, you must ensure a search engine views your site as the most appropriate match.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEvery search engine uses a different algorithm to determine what the best result to a search query is. This will include a combination of different factors, including the quality of your content and backlinks, how many visitors your site has, and your website\u2019s speed and uptime.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModern SEO is complex, and mastering it takes more than just getting the right meta tags. It includes understanding how rich snippets, video, and featured snippets work to enhance your rankings, as well as the importance of voice search and Video SEO. If you want to be successful using Google Search, you also need to understand how Google Rank Brain scores your website and must optimise your site to score highly on Google\u2019s algorithm.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat is Local SEO?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELocal SEO is also becoming more critical, and you will need to learn the basics of this, especially since nearly half of all Google searches now have a local intent. Near Me searches have grown even faster, exploding at a rate of 150% more than local searches alone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMastering SEO includes understanding Technical SEO, which focuses on priming your website for crawling and indexing by search engines. It\u2019s important you don\u2019t neglect this aspect, as without it search engines will find it difficult to access, crawl, and index your website. As a result, you\u2019ll rank much lower. The reason this process is referred to as \u201CTechnical SEO\u201D is because it has nothing to do with promoting your website, and is not the same as the type of SEO you include in your content.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat types of careers will this course help you with?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you complete this course, you\u2019ll be a Digital Marketing Master, and will have many different career options open to you. You could work as a freelance Facebook Ads \u0026amp; Instagram Ads consultant, market brands, or promote your own business. Your options will be almost unlimited, as strong digital marketing skills are \u003Cem\u003Ehighly \u003C/em\u003Ein demand.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs they focus on online business, and can be done entirely online, Digital Marketing jobs are also pandemic proof, so your skillset will always be needed. Just make sure to narrow down your choices and focus on what you enjoy and do well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe you have a passion for branding, and would like to work as a branding consultant for start-up companies? Perhaps you\u2019re interested in specialising, whether that be in marketing for the tech sector, the health and wellness niche, or in real estate?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best way to achieve top earnings is to find a niche you can position yourself as an authority voice in, and you can do this by acquiring a skillset your competitors don\u2019t have. If you can offer expertise in Facebook advertising, or email marketing, for example, you will be bringing something extra to the table that will give you an edge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving niche knowledge will mark you out from other candidates trying to land their first gig and signal that you\u2019re a high value candidate to employers and clients.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also specialise by diversifying into niche careers such as SEO or copywriting. SEO knowledge is a highly in demand skill and it doesn\u2019t require a qualification. If you know how to do it right, copywriting can be similarly rewarding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause of the amount of online content we consume, demand for skilled SEO experts and pro copywriters has grown massively. More brands than ever require well-written content, that\u2019s optimised to perform well in search. If you can combine the two, you\u2019ll have a HUGE competitive advantage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you\u2019re getting started, you can try freelance sites, like Elance or People per Hour, although it will take a little while to build up a reputation. Blogging can be another area you can build up a following in and then monetize, though to do well you must post regularly, and provide unique content.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWebsite design skills, which you will learn on this course, are another great way to make money. You can gain practical experience by creating sites for your family and friends for free, or in exchange for their skills. Practical experience is essential when you\u2019re first starting out and will stand you in great stead as you progress in your mastery.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you become more confident and have built up your portfolio, you\u2019ll be able to land paid clients.

It provides us with the list of services and various tools which are required for building the Mobile User Interface with the native feel and the same look. The ionic framework needs to have a native wrapper interface using which it will be able to run the ionic based applications on mobile devices. Moreover, it can be known to be the front-end based HTML framework which comprises many front end languages, and therefore it is built on top of the possibly best front end framework, AngularJS, and Cordova. It is an HTML5 based Mobile Application development framework which is targeted at building mobile-based hybrid apps. Ionic can be thought of as a front end UI framework that is used to handle the basic look and feel and the User interface based interactions that are required for the app to be compelling. It is somewhat like Bootstrap for native applications that are built for the support of a broad range of common and basic native mobile-based components, beautiful design, and slick animations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe features would include AngularJS based Model View Controller architecture for creating and building rich SPAs also known as Single Page Applications particularly optimized for the device and mobile-based devices. Other features would include CSS components that come along with the native look and feel and are used to provide all the elements which are typically required by a mobile-based web application. The default styling of the components can be easily overridden which can accommodate their designs. The JavaScript components extend the CSS component capabilities and also Javascript related functions and their capabilities to cover the mobile elements which cannot be only done with HTML and CSS. Other features include the ones related to Cordova plugins that offer the API related to the usage of the mobile-based native device functions with JavaScript code. The Ionic CLI is a NodeJS based utility which is powered by the various commands required for building, starting, running as well as emulating ionic applications. The views are a very useful platform that is required for sharing, uploading, and testing your applications for native devices.

It talks and explains the networking basics which is much more helpful for the beginners who are new to the world and domain of networking. This OSPF Certification course of Routing Protocol OSPF builds a strong foundation for them to prepare for good level certifications like CCNA. You will be able to learn all the terminologies and key functionalities related to routing protocols. There is n number of routing protocols that are developed today but only very few have been adopted by the industry. In this course, all those concepts will be explained in detail and you can practice them at your ease. The broad areas to be covered are related to configurations, operations, and troubleshooting. Apart from that, there are a few use cases of two very popular Routing protocols that work on the principle of OSPF and have their level of advantages. This OSPF Certification Module describes how to connect and configure and operate Open Shortest Path First which was specifically designed for IP networks and therefore supports IP tagging and sub-netting of extremely derived information related to routing. It also allows the packet-based information and authentication to take place and also makes use of the multicast for Internet protocol when either sending or receiving any packet\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis course module named Routing Protocols RIP and EIGRP is quite similar to the one used above and is also responsible to teach you many basics and fundamental concepts such as those related to troubleshooting, operation, and configuration. The two most important routing protocols which will be explained in detail are the RIP also known as Routing information protocol and the other is EIGRP which is the abbreviated form for Extended interior Gateway protocol. In the RIP protocol, the oldest of the vectors for distance IP Routing protocols are still put to use and thereby getting various enhancements. There are currently two versions that exist for the RIP viz. RIPv1 and RIPv2. RIPv1 is also said to be the classful protocol which means that it is not classless whereas if you talk about the RIPv2, it is considered to be the classless support routing protocol and IPv6 is the one whose support is extended to RIPv2 with the next-gen RIP which is also termed as RIPng. EIGRP, on the other hand, is related to the Interior Gateway protocol as it is a proprietary protocol of the company CISCO. This protocol is occasionally described as the distance vector routing protocol which also acts and imitates like a link state-oriented protocol. Distance vector-based protocols share everything of which they are aware of. The only limitation they carry is that the amount of information shared is only among the neighbors which are directly or indirectly connected with each other. Link state-based protocols announce that the information present is only about the direction and not indirectly connected links. However, they are also responsible to share the routing protocol information among themselves in all the areas they deem fit among all the routes in their domain or area.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/cisco-ospf-hands-on-certification-training/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4844382_3644_3.jpg","duration":"10.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"10,051.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["The target audience for this course is anybody who has a keen interest in the field of digital communication and is also aware of how the basics of understanding the networks and other routing protocols and mechanisms such as OSPF Routing.

This is a comprehensive data analysis course where you will be guided step by step on how to perform complex data analysis and visualisation on inflation data using R programming language. This course is a perfect combination of macroeconomics and statistics as you will learn all things about inflation from both perspectives. In the introduction session, you will learn basic fundamentals of R programming language, such as getting to know its use cases and features that R has but Python does not have. Then, continue by learning the basic fundamentals of macroeconomics and inflation, using case study examples to understand inflation better as well as getting to know factors that cause inflation. Afterward, you will also learn how to calculate inflation rate and interest rate as well as understanding the relationship between both of them, especially why in most cases raising the interest rate can help to lower the inflation rate. Before starting the project, you will be guided step by step on how to set up all necessary tools, such as installing R programming language and R Studio which is the IDE that will be used in our project. Meanwhile, for the data source, we are going to get our datasets from Kaggle which is one of the largest data science learning platforms that has a lot of datasets that can be downloaded for free. In the project section, you are going to be conducting analysis and visualisation on two different datasets from Kaggle. At the end of the project, you are also going to learn how to deliver data insights and summaries which highlight all your findings during the project. Last but not least, at the end of the course, we will also go over several solutions that can be implemented to lower inflation rate like effective monetary policy, cutting of unnecessary government spending, and fiscal responsibility.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, before getting into the course, we need to ask ourselves these questions. Why should we learn about inflation? Why should we analyze inflation data using the R programming language? Well, let me ask you this question first, have you ever asked yourself, why a cup of coffee that cost two dollars five years ago but now the same product with the same quality costs three dollars? Or maybe why a gaming desk cost you a hundred dollars three years ago but today the same product from the same brand costs you two hundred dollars. Well, those are a few examples of inflation in real life where your cash today is no longer as valuable as it used to be a couple years ago and you might be wondering why? Well inflation reduces a currency\u2019s purchasing power as what we discussed in the previous example where two dollars could buy you a cup of coffee five years ago but today you need three dollars. There are many factors out there that can potentially cause inflation however the most common factor is the oversupply of cash where there is more cash in the circulation than the actual demand. Let me give you an example, let\u2019s say there is an island with population of a thousand people and there are only a hundred coins in the circulation, obviously in this case, the coin is very valuable as they are a thousand people who want to get those coins but there are only a hundred coins available but what if I told you the island\u2019s ministry of treasury decided to create nine hundred more coins, so now there are a thousand coins in the circulation, obviously, now the value of one coin is definitely not as valuable as it used to be.
