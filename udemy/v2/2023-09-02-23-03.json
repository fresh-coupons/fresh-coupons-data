This course is a follow-up from the earlier course on \u003Cstrong\u003EReverse Engineering \u0026amp; Memory Hacking\u003C/strong\u003E. It is the practical application of what you have learnt in the first course. If you think that packing and anti-debugging is good enough to prevent reverse engineering, then you may be in for a surprise. In this course, I\u0026nbsp;will show you how to test the effectiveness of several popular packers by packing crackmes and then reversing them - \u003Cstrong\u003Ewithout unpacking. \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETraditionally packed programs are unpacked before debugging is carried out. This is because a packed program\u0027s file cannot be patched. Much of software protection has centered on making it difficult to unpack programs. However,\u0026nbsp; the important question is: how effective is packing, obfuscation and anti-debugging as a means to prevent reversing? This course explores several packers to find the answers. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe will do the analysis using a tool called Cheat Engine, which is a prominent tool used by game hackers. This tool could also be used to study and analyze packed program\u0027s processes that is running in memory. You will learn how to perform debugging in spite of anti-debugging being implemented. There is no need to unpack and dump memory.\u0026nbsp; Instead of unpacking and then patching the dumped files and fixing IAT (Import Address Table) tables,\u0026nbsp; we will write scripts to hack memory using byte patching using an advanced technique called AOB (Array-Of-Bytes) Injection, by injecting code into code caves (inline memory patching).\u0026nbsp; In this course you will learn how to do all of the above and more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the end of this course you will be able to gauge the effectiveness of software packers, obfuscation and anti-debugging protection and also to have a good idea of how to implement extra countermeasures to improve the security of software.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn all the practical exercises and walkthroughs, we will use Crackme\u0027s which I\u0026nbsp;have written.

Two fundamental principles of Islamic banking are the sharing of profit and loss and the prohibition of the collection and payment of interest by lenders and investors. In Islamic banking, the banks do not collect interests from creditors. Instead, they earn money using equity participation systems and share profits and losses. Islamic finance is practiced in many Muslim countries and is extremely popular among Islamic communities, as some conventional banking practices might be against Shariah. Islamic finance is considered more ethical than conventional banking, as it believes that a bank and its clients should make profits and losses together. Hence, it does not just focus on maximizing the bank\u2019s wealth. Also, Islamic finance practices consider the best interests of the Muslim community.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIslamic banking development can be attributed to some conventional banking theories and practices which go against and hurt the sentiments of the Muslim communities. Hence, Islamic finance was developed by inventing methods that are Sharia-compliant. Sharia is the Islamic law present in the Quran\u2019s teachings. Creating practices that align with the Muslim culture and beliefs encourages many to take up banking. Islamic finance is so strictly followed that banks look to religious leaders and scholars for guidance. The main objective of Islamic banking\u003Cstrong\u003E \u003C/strong\u003Eand finance is that all society participants should create wealth and benefit.

Thus, getting into a project finance role is not easy; one must possess commendable analytical acumen and quantitative skills besides a profound understanding of investment banking. However, if you are one of those who intend to pursue a career in the field of project finance, then you are at the right place, as this article will discuss in detail. In short, this article will make your dream come true.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt refers to the funding of any long-term industrial projects or infrastructure with the help of a non-recourse financial structure. In this type of arrangement, the entire funding (mix of debt and equity) is not done at the start of the project but rather sequentially as the project progresses. The repayment obligations are met using the cash flow generated by the project itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet us take the help of a simple example to explain the working of project finance. Assuming the commencement of a toll gate project in 2021, the project will complete within five years, by the end of 2025. to simplify matters, the project will entirely fund through debt, with 20% of the funds allocated annually, starting in 2021, to ensure the project\u2019s completion within the five-year timeframe. The entire funding will utilize by the end of the five years. Following the project\u2019s completion, debt repayment will commence in 2026 and continue over the subsequent ten years, concluding by the end of 2035. The repayment will be made using the revenue from the collected toll tax. Now, the role of the project finance team is to build a robust financial model to study the viability of the future cash flow of the project and, depending on that, decide the capital structure and the source of funding arranged at the same time. A special purpose vehicle (SPV) is created to execute the entire project properly.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/project-finance-fundamentals-a-beginners-guide/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5531244_a4f3.jpg","duration":"1 total hour","enrolledStudentsCount":"272.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Students of finance \u0026 accounting: If as a student of finance and/or accounting you have an interest in regards to project finance, this is the perfect course for you.
