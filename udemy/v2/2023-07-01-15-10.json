It\u0027s the ability to imagine someone else\u0027s pain, joy, anger in our hearts. In order for interpersonal relationships to work effectively and be satisfying, empathy is key. By making sense of what\u0027s said and not said; what\u0027s done and not done, we can make sense of everything. We\u0027re better at receiving and processing information, and finding solutions with it. Our intrinsic sense of justice is rooted in empathy, which strengthens bonds of trust. People can learn a lot about their behavior by empathizing with the negative, i.e., the emotions behind their unpleasant or destructive actions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are 5 major topics I\u0027d like to cover in this master\u0027s course\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

Zero trust architectures simplify network infrastructure, make users happier, and keep cyberthreats at a distance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince John Kindervag, then at Forrester Research, coined the phrase, zero trust architectures follow the maxim \u0022never trust, always verify.\u0022 To block inappropriate access and lateral movement throughout an environment, zero trust architecture enforces access policies based on context\u2014including the user\u0027s role and location, the device they\u0027re using, and the data they\u0027re asking for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA zero trust architecture means you know who\u0027s using what, and you can track it, including encrypted traffic; you need to monitor and verify the traffic between parts of the environment; and you need multifactor authentication (MFA) that goes beyond passwords.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn important thing to remember is that in a zero trust architecture, a resource\u0027s location isn\u0027t as important as before. Rather than rigid network segmentation, software-defined microsegmentation protects your data, workflows, services, and such anywhere, in your data center or distributed hybrid or multicloud.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy using a network-centric data security strategy that provides specific access only to those who need it, Zero Trust Architecture focuses on the business needs and functionality of an organization. By enabling parameters to dictate access and restrictions, the Zero Trust model views data security from a whole new perspective. As opposed to legacy networks that have little to no visibility or control over network and data usage, Zero Trust Architectures see all network traffic through segmentation gateways with granular policies governing access to data, apps, and assets. There are certain rules that have to be followed before a resource can be accessed in a Zero Trust network.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe five major topics I want to cover in this master\u0027s course are\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

Flappy Bird \u0026amp; Ping Pong Games with Godot Engine course. This is basically an extensive project based course where you will be guided step by step on how to build a dynamic action survival game from scratch using Godot Engine and potentially build a sustainable passive income from selling the game on online Marketplaces. This course will teach you on how to build and design games without having to know extensive programming skill as Godot Engine has a visual scripting feature that allows you to drag and drop objects. In the introduction session, you will learn the basic fundamentals of Godot Engine, technologies used behind it, and its main use cases, then continue with a full step by step tutorial on how to install Godot Engine, tutorial to navigate its dashboard, as well as exploring all features available on that platform. Afterward, you will also be shown a couple examples of games created using Godot Engine and going over all potential game ideas to build. To make the learning experience even more complete, this course also comes with a project where you will be guided step by step on how to build an action survival theme game from scratch using Godot Engine. Once the game has been built, we will be conducting testing to make sure that all features have been fully functioning and most essentially the game has a friendly user interface from the player perspectives. In the testing session, there will be three main objectives that need to be tested, those are functional testing, performance testing, and user experience testing. Lastly, at the end of the course you will also learn effective marketing strategies that you can implement to reach more potential audiences to play your game as well as get to know several marketplace to sell your games like Itch IO and Steam.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, before getting into the course, we need to ask ourselves this question. Why should we learn building games using Godot? Well, the answer might be pretty obvious to some people, this is one of the best platform that you can utilise to build and design game without having very advances programming skills, other than that, there are still many other reasons why, Godot Engine has been well known to offer a comprehensive set of game creation tools, including a visual scripting system, 3D modelling tools, terrain editors, and animation tools. Not only that, Godot also provides social features that allow users to connect, collaborate, and engage with other players and creators. Users can join communities, participate in events, share feedback, and form friendships within the platform\u0027s social ecosystem. Last but not least, Godot supports multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, HTML5, and more. It provides a unified development environment that allows developers to create games that can run seamlessly on different operating systems and devices. Hence, when it comes to compatibility testing for the game that you build and design using Godot Engine, most likely it would pass without any issue\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow are things that you will learn from the course:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearning basic fundamentals of Godot engine, getting to know technologies behind it, and its use cases\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExploring Godot dashboard \u0026amp; features\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearning basic GDscript code\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBuilding \u0026amp; designing flappy bird clone game\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBuilding \u0026amp; designing ping pong game\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearning game testing objectives: functional testing, user experience testing, and performance testing\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearning effective marketing strategies to promote your game\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGetting to know marketplaces where game developers can sell their game\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/building-flappy-bird-ping-pong-games-with-godot-engine/","imageUri":"https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5412300_177f.jpg","duration":"4 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"2,245.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["People who are interested in building games using Godot Engine","People who are interested to learn GDscript programming language"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":0,"averageValue":"0.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"Christ Raharja","url":"/user/christ-raharja/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":0}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"3106E5272A6050A2C817","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"3 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/modeling-rending-interior-office-project-in-revit/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5379914,"title":"Revit Arch. : Modeling \u0026 Rendering Interior office project","shortDescription":"Follow Complete Step by Step instructions to become from Beginner to Pro Level in Modeling \u0026 Rendering Interior Office","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to Learning \u0026amp; Exploring Civil Engineering Concepts \u0026amp; Softwares Practically. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAutodesk Revit is a building information modelling software tool for architects, landscape architects, structural engineers, mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) engineers, designers and contractors.

It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E* Javascript Course Contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Introduction\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Array\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Variables\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Functions\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Objects\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Control Statements\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Cookies\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Loop statements\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Data Structures\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Error Handling\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Regular Expressions\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESee you inside the course\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThank you see you inside the course\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/css-and-javascript-complete-course-for-beginners/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4282170_1ea0.jpg","duration":"4 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"74,078.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["For People New to CSS And JavaScript","For People Who want to learn CSS And JavaScript Fundamentals and later Transition into Web Designing","For People New to Web Designing"],"tags":["CSS","JavaScript"],"rating":{"count":795,"averageValue":"4.5"},"instructors":[{"name":"PROPER DOT INSTITUTE","url":"/user/vivek-dahibhate-2/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.443548}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"F41DEDD03F5DC6CACC98","originalPrice":"\u20B91,699","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/quickbooks-certification-exam-practice-test-2023-updated/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5367396,"title":"Quickbooks Certification Exam - Practice Test - 2023 Updated","shortDescription":"\u0022Excel in QuickBooks Certification Exam: Comprehensive Practice Test With Detailed Explanations - Updated 2023\u0022","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Unlock your potential and ace the QuickBooks Online examination with our comprehensive practice test.
