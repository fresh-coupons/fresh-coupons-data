Master core HR roles and responsibilities. Become top-notch HRM Practitioner","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EThis Human Resource Management - HR Fundamentals 101 to Advanced course focusses on creating or setting up such an environment or work atmosphere in the workplace where the employees can be highly productive and perform their best to achieve the organization\u2019s goals and objectives. This course contains modules that educate the human resource professional on career development opportunities for the employees and helps them to design the progress framework.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe real asset of a company is not its infrastructure nor it is the profits, it is its employees who work wholeheartedly for the company. The companies, who understand this thing well, never get into higher losses. So the essence is that every company should try to make its employees happy all the while. Now if we talk about the performance part of the employees, so it also matters a lot for the company and yes it is not exaggerated to say that employees should also feel the responsibility of work. So to make employees motivated toward work there is a concept of \u201Cperformance appraisal\u201D in every company which is basically the allowance, paid to the employee whose performance is excellent in every assignment provided to him. So this is basically linked directly to the performance of the employee.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHiring new employees is one thing and retaining the new as well as the existing employees is also pivotal. The course focusses on different strategies for retaining the performing employees who are a valuable gem to the company. Retention strategies focus on methods to make the employees feel valued and engaged to keep them or retain them. Retention methods are very effective in creating a positive impact among the employees and thus helps to increase the turnover of the company.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this ever-changing work environment, employee turnover is a best-oriented move that could see fresh faces, fresh ideas, and experience beaming all through the work environment. Turnover is highly reinvigorating and refreshing, but too much turnover can cause a brain drain, and naturally, that\u2019s not good for the company\u2019s health. Advice keeps the balance straight and tries every bid to keep the turnover less than 15 percent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou will often come across people, who are just not settling in at one workplace, and in their search for another temporary job, they end up giving you an interview for a particular post. The chances are that they might have all the qualifications required and all the right criteria you have been looking for, but if he is a job hopper, you should let go of him and find another person for the job at your firm. Hiring somebody for the short term is both hectic and shortsighted since the person might leave anytime, and you will have to work on looking for a new employee again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe will start with a brief introduction to human resource and its presence in an organization. Then we will move ahead with the role of HR and its working in managing and controlling the human resource of an organization. The entire module will give you a brief idea of what Human Resource is and how easy or difficult can the role of an HR be. You need to watch 24 videos in total to cover the module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis course focuses on workforce planning, development and management and related issues like salary and compensation management, holiday and leave management for the employees, retirement plans, provident fund management, health plans and insurance of the employees and their family, recruitment and selection procedures for hiring quality and potential employees, retaining the employees are also looked after by the human resource management. The recruitment and selection team will look after interviewing and hiring of the candidates and their cost to the company.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHuman Resource Management is an umbrella term used for the development and management of people in an organization. HRM as a process is very important for an organization, without which it will be a tedious task to run an organization.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHRM also helps the employees to live up to their full potential and perform their best and hence benefit the organization.

Moreover, integrating AI to our business regardless of niche and business model has always been a wise decision, in our case, adding designs generated by AI will definitely deliver more value to the business.

It assumes that you\u0027re new to the language, so it gets you started with basic functionality such as creating functions, creating variables, and calling these lines of code from your standard HTML pages. It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E* Javascript Course Contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Introduction\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Array\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Variables\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Functions\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Objects\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Control Statements\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Cookies\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Loop statements\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Data Structures\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Error Handling\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Regular Expressions\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESee you inside the course\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-for-beginners-complete-course/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4200368_f71e_5.jpg","duration":"2 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"90,637.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["For Javascript  Programming Beginners","For People New to Javascript","For People Who want to learn Javascript Fundamentals and later Transition into Web Development"],"tags":["JavaScript"],"rating":{"count":1045,"averageValue":"4.2"},"instructors":[{"name":"PROPER DOT INSTITUTE","url":"/user/vivek-dahibhate-2/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.162088}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"AF69538054BC1C9D36AF","originalPrice":"\u20B91,299","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-basic-computer-course-master-using-computer/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":3504028,"title":"The Complete Computer Basics Course: Become a Power User","shortDescription":"Basic Computer Course - IT Support - Computer Fundamentals - Desktop Support - Basic Computer Skills","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EThe Complete Basic Computer Course: Master Using Computer: Basic Computer Course - Desktop Support - It Support - Computer Basics- Computer Fundamentals - Basic Computer Skills\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnderstand every concept of computer science and become a master of using it. we all have computers or we are computer students so, in this course, I am focused to help you understand every essential thing you need for the first time because computer basics is the #1 thing you have to learn.

It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E*\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E javascript course contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript introduction\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript array\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript variables\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript functions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript objects\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript control statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript cookies\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript loop statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript data structures\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript error handling\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript regular expressions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003Esection 3- learn PHP\u0026nbsp;programming language\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this section, we will learn the basic structure of a web application, and how a web browser interacts with a web server.

There is a BIG difference in the way these two types of results are ranked. With organic search results, there are many more ranking factors that you will need to consider if you want to perform well in search. When it comes to paid results, advertisers are ranked according to the amount they\u2019ll pay a single visitor, sent to them through Google\u2019s Pay Per Click Ad\u2019s network. The more they are willing to pay the higher they will rank. It\u2019s as simple as that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrganic search doesn\u2019t work in the same way. You can\u2019t pay your way to the top. Instead, you need to optimise your site, pages, and content so you score highly in Google\u2019s ranking algorithm. The good news is, when people search for information on a topic, most people trust organic search results FAR more than they trust paid results.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this video, we\u2019ll be focusing solely on organic results, and giving you tips and advice you can use to perform well in organic Google search.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy do you need SEO?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch engines will be one of the main sources of traffic to your webpage and Google is the biggest and most popular search engine, by far.

It is responsible for coordinating the execution of the entire Spark application. The driver program defines the SparkContext, which serves as the entry point for Spark functionality. It handles the division of the application into tasks, scheduling them on the cluster, and managing the overall execution. The driver communicates with the cluster manager to allocate resources and coordinate the distribution of tasks to worker nodes. It also maintains control and monitoring of the application.
