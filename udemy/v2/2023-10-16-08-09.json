Se compone en base a etiquetas, tambi\u00E9n llamadas marcas o tags, con las cuales conseguimos expresar las partes de un documento, cabecera, cuerpo, encabezados, p\u00E1rrafos, etc. En definitiva, el contenido de una p\u00E1gina web.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHTML es el primer lenguaje que debe aprender cualquier persona interesada en construir un sitio web. A partir de HTML podemos pasar a muchos otros lenguajes interesantes que sirven para hacer cosas diversas y m\u00E1s avanzadas. Es decir, sea cual sea la tecnolog\u00EDa, herramienta o gestor de contenido que nos hayamos propuesto aprender, o que tengamos que usar en nuestro d\u00EDa a d\u00EDa, HTML siempre ser\u00E1 el lenguaje en el que toda web se construye y, por tanto, es de obligado conocimiento para todos.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECSS son las siglas en ingl\u00E9s de Cascading Style Sheets, que significa \u0022hojas de estilo en cascada\u0022. Es un lenguaje que se usa para estilizar elementos escritos en un lenguaje de marcado como HTML. Este lenguaje fue desarrollado por W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) en 1996 por una raz\u00F3n muy sencilla. HTML no fue dise\u00F1ado para tener etiquetas que ayuden a formatear la p\u00E1gina. Est\u00E1 hecho solo para escribir el marcado para el sitio.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHTML y CSS son dos de los lenguajes de programaci\u00F3n m\u00E1s populares del mundo. Junto con JavaScript (que se utiliza para la funcionalidad), HTML (que se utiliza para la estructura de la p\u00E1gina web), y CSS (que se utiliza para el estilo), se consideran dos de los lenguajes fundamentales para el desarrollo web.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAprender HTML y CSS es sencillo. En pocos d\u00EDas o semanas ser\u00E1s capaz de entender y usar las etiquetas m\u00E1s comunes y componer documentos HTML (p\u00E1ginas web) correctas, y usar los selectores y propiedades m\u00E1s comunes y crear tus propias hojas de estilos con CSS. Aqu\u00ED encontrar\u00E1s muchas ayudas para poder dar esos primeros pasos y luego profundizar en cualquier \u00E1rea que necesites.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELa relaci\u00F3n entre HTML y CSS es muy fuerte. Dado que HTML es un lenguaje de marcado (es decir, constituye la base de un sitio) y CSS enfatiza el estilo (toda la parte est\u00E9tica de un sitio web), van de la mano. CSS no es t\u00E9cnicamente una necesidad, pero no querr\u00E1s tener un sitio que solo tenga HTML, ya que se ver\u00EDa completamente desnudo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEste curso de HTML y CSS te llevar\u00E1 desde principiante hasta profesional.

It assumes that you\u0027re new to the language, so it gets you started with basic functionality such as creating functions, creating variables, and calling these lines of code from your standard HTML pages. It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E*\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E javascript course contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript introduction\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript array\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript variables\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript functions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript objects\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript control statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript cookies\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript loop statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript data structures\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript error handling\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript regular expressions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESection 4- python programming language.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis course section provides an introduction to programming and the python language. students are introduced to core python programming concepts like conditionals, loops, variables, and functions. this section includes an overview of the various python aspects.

I\u0027ve worked in radio/television as a producer/host and I\u0027ve been interviewed by national media outlets from Good Morning America to the New York Times, so I\u0027m picky; and I\u0027m typically critical of those I see out there passing themselves off as media training experts, especially since I do media training (on a much smaller scale) myself. TJ Walker is the real deal. Though the production values aren\u0027t high end and the lighting/background could use some tweaking, the content itself is top-notch.
