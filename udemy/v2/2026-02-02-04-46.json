COEs offer clustering and convert your nodes into one super computer, make intelligent\u00A0\u00A0decisions as to where to schedule the containers, connect containers running on different nodes by setting up multi host network and offer many other interesting features such as fault tolerance, zero downtime deployments etc.\u00A0\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKubernetes is the gold standard in the world of container orchestration.
