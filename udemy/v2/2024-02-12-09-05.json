By addressing stigma, we can create an environment where individuals feel comfortable seeking help, receiving appropriate care, and living fulfilling lives. Mental health stigma refers to the negative attitudes, beliefs, and stereotypes that surround mental health and mental illness. It involves prejudiced judgments, discrimination, and the marginalization of individuals with mental health conditions. Stigma can manifest at various levels, including societal, interpersonal, and self-stigma. Addressing mental health stigma involves promoting awareness, education, and challenging misconceptions. Efforts to reduce stigma aim to create a more supportive and understanding environment for individuals with mental health conditions, fostering a society where mental health is treated with the same importance and empathy as physical health. The objective of this course is to understand and explore the concept and types of mental health stigma, examine how mental health stigma affects individuals and society and develop strategies to combat mental health stigma. This course aims to help educators, students, research scholars, mental health practitioners and counselors to understand and apply strategies for combating mental health stigma and promoting mental health resilience.
