Leadership can be exhibited at various levels within an organization, from frontline supervisors to top executives.","Business management refers to the process of planning, organizing, directing, and controlling resources (such as human, financial, and material) to achieve organizational objectives efficiently and effectively. It encompasses various functions such as strategic planning, operations management, marketing, finance, and human resources management. Business managers are responsible for overseeing day-to-day operations, ensuring that resources are utilized optimally, and adapting to changes in the business environment to sustain or improve organizational performance.","Importance of the Role of C-level Executive / CEO: The role of a C-level executive, particularly the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), is crucial in shaping the strategic direction and overall success of an organization. Some key aspects of their importance include:","Setting Vision and Strategy: The CEO is responsible for defining the organization\u0027s mission, vision, and long-term strategic goals.

Learning provides them with the knowledge and analytical tools necessary to evaluate options, assess risks, and make informed decisions that drive sustainable business growth.","Employee Development and Engagement:  Investing in learning opportunities for managers demonstrates a commitment to employee development and engagement. Managers who prioritize learning set a positive example for their teams, fostering a culture of continuous improvement and personal growth within the organization.

The term digital forensics was originally used as a synonym for \u003Cstrong\u003Ecomputer forensics\u003C/strong\u003E but has expanded to cover investigation of all devices capable of storing digital data. With roots in the personal computing revolution of the late 1970s and early 1980s, the discipline evolved in a haphazard manner during the 1990s, and it was not until the early 21st century that national policies emerged.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDigital forensics investigations have a variety of applications. The most common is to support or refute a hypothesis before criminal or civil courts. Criminal cases involve the alleged breaking of laws that are defined by legislation and that are enforced by the police and prosecuted by the state, such as theft and assault against the person. Civil cases on the other hand deal with protecting the rights and property of individuals (often associated with family disputes) but may also be concerned with contractual disputes between commercial entities where a form of digital forensics referred to as electronic discovery (discovery) may be involved\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring the 1980s very few specialized digital forensic tools existed, and consequently investigators often performed live analysis on media, examining computers from within the operating system using existing sysadmin tools to extract evidence. This practice carried the risk of modifying data on the disk, either inadvertently or otherwise, which led to claims of evidence tampering. A number of tools were created during the early 1990s to address the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDigital forensics is commonly used in both criminal law and private investigation. Traditionally it has been associated with criminal law, where evidence is collected to support or oppose a hypothesis before the courts. As with other areas of forensics this is often a part of a wider investigation spanning a number of disciplines. In some cases, the collected evidence is used as a form of intelligence gathering, used for other purposes than court proceedings (for example to locate, identify or halt other crimes). As a result, intelligence gathering is sometimes held to a less strict forensic standard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you enroll in our Digital Forensics Masterclass | Forensic Science 2023 DFMC, you\u0027ll not only learn about the fundamentals of digital forensics, but so much more!

In this module, you will learn how to publish your app to the Google Play Store. You will also explore strategies for app monetization, including in-app purchases\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven though Kotlin is a full-fledged functional programming language, it preserves most of the object-oriented nature of Java as an alternative programming style, which is very handy when converting existing Java code. Kotlin has classes with constructors, along with nested, inner, and anonymous inner classes, and it has interfaces like Java 8. Kotlin does \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E have a new keyword. To create a class instance, call the constructor just like a regular function. We saw that in the screenshot above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKotlin has single inheritance from a named superclass, and all Kotlin classes have a default superclass Any, which is \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E the same as the Java base class java.lang.Object. Any contains only three predefined member functions: equals(), hashCode(), and toString().\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKotlin classes have to be marked with the open keyword in order to allow other classes to inherit from them; Java classes are kind of the opposite, as they are inheritable \u003Cem\u003Eunless\u003C/em\u003E marked with the final keyword. To override a superclass method, the method itself must be marked open, and the subclass method must be marked override. This is all of a piece with Kotlin\u2019s philosophy of making things explicit rather than relying on defaults. In this particular case, I can see where Kotlin\u2019s way of explicitly marking base class members as open for inheritance and derived class members as overrides avoids several kinds of common Java errors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, you\u0027ll learn how to create apps and run them on virtual devices through guided exercises. You\u0027ll cover the fundamentals of Android development, from structuring an app to building out the UI with Activities and Fragments and various navigation patterns. Progressing through the chapters and lectures, you\u0027ll delve into Android\u0027s RecyclerView to make the most of displaying lists of data and become comfortable with fetching data from a web service and handling images. You\u0027ll then learn about mapping, location services, and the permissions model before working with notifications and how to persist data. Moving on, you\u0027ll get to grips with testing, covering the full spectrum of the test pyramid. You\u0027ll also learn how AAC (Android Architecture Components) are used to cleanly structure your code and explore various architecture patterns and the benefits of dependency injection. \u003Cem\u003EThe core libraries of RxJava and Coroutines are covered for asynchronous programming\u003C/em\u003E. The focus then returns to the UI, demonstrating how to add motion and transitions when users interact with your apps. Towards the end, you\u0027ll build an interesting app to retrieve and display popular movies from a movie database, and then see how to publish your apps on Google Play. By the end of this course, you\u0027ll have the skills and confidence needed to build fully-fledged Android apps using Kotlin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre you trying to start a career in Android programming, but haven\u0027t found the right way in?

If so, then this course is for you\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen Android first arrived in 2008, it was a bit drab compared to the much more stylish iOS on the Apple iPhone/iPad. But, quite quickly, through a variety of handset offers that struck a chord with practical, price-conscious consumers, as well as those who are fashion-conscious and tech-savvy, Android user numbers exploded. For many, myself included, developing for Android is the most rewarding pastime and business, bar none. Quickly putting together a prototype of an idea, refining it, and then deciding to run with it and wire it up into a fully-fledged app, is such an exciting and rewarding process. Any programming can be fun \u2013 I have been programming all my life \u2013 but creating for Android is somehow extraordinarily rewarding..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKotlin is the most succinct language, and therefore is the least error-prone, \u003Cem\u003Ewhich is great for beginners\u003C/em\u003E. Kotlin is also the most fun language, mainly because the succinctness means you can get results faster and with less code. Google considers Kotlin an official (first-class) Android language. There are some other advantages to Kotlin that make it less error-prone and less likely to make mistakes that cause crashes. We will discover the details of these advantages as we proceed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKotlin is an object-oriented language. This means that it uses the concept of reusable programming objects. If this sounds like technical jargon, another analogy will help. Kotlin enables us and others (like the Android API development team) to write code that can be structured based on real-world things, and here is the important part \u2013 it can be reused.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/kotlin-android-training-android-app-development/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4365954_c92d_6.jpg","duration":"15.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"90,079.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Beginner Kotlin Developers","Android Kotlin Programming Training","Mobile App Development Course"],"tags":["Android Development","Kotlin"],"rating":{"count":514,"averageValue":"4.5"},"instructors":[{"name":"OCSALY Academy | 390.000\u002B Students - Ethical Hacking","url":"/user/online-academy-of-computer-science/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.3223686}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"LAST_JULY_2024","originalPrice":"\u20B91,999","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-ethical-hacking-linux-and-metasploit-training/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4488594,"title":"Real Ethical Hacking in 43 Hours: Certificated CSEH\u002BCEH PRO","shortDescription":"Ethical Hacking, Pentest, Python Hacking, CEH, Metasploit, Linux , Nmap, Linux Hacking, OSCP and other awesome topics. \u002B","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEthical hacking\u003C/strong\u003E is the identification and exploitation of security vulnerabilities for the purpose of improving an organization\u2019s cyber security.

He literally walks you through everything, so it\u0027s like you\u0027re right there looking over his shoulder. For anyone wanting to understand all the fundamentals of Wordpress, I think you\u0027ll absolutely love this course. It will save you tons of time by having all this information in one place.

I\u0027ve always had a lot of questions about the many settings and various options in Wordpress and most courses just skip over them or tell you to check this box and move on with no explanation. I never really got my questions answered until now. Jenius is very detailed in his instruction. He walks you through step by step and tells you what each setting or section is for, how it is used (or not used) and why.

The goal of computer forensics is to perform a structured investigation and maintain a documented chain of evidence to find out exactly what happened on a computing device and who was responsible for it. Computer forensics -- which is sometimes referred to as computer forensic science essentially is data recovery with legal compliance guidelines to make the information admissible in legal proceedings. The terms digital forensics and cyber forensics are often used as synonyms for computer forensics. Digital forensics starts with the collection of information in a way that maintains its integrity. Investigators then analyze the data or system to determine if it was changed, how it was changed and who made the changes. The use of computer forensics isn\u0027t always tied to a crime. The forensic process is also used as part of data recovery processes to gather data from a crashed server, failed drive, reformatted operating system (OS) or other situation where a system has unexpectedly stopped working.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy is computer forensics important?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the civil and criminal justice system, computer forensics helps ensure the integrity of digital evidence presented in court cases.

A person would be able to redo and reproduce an origami by unfolding it first. Knowing how cars work requires understanding each major and minor mechanical part and their purposes. The complex nature of the human anatomy requires people to understand each and every part of the body. How? By dissecting it. Reverse engineering is a way for us to understand how things were designed, why is it in its state, when it triggers, how it works, and what its purpose is. In effect, the information is used to redesign and improve for better performance and cost. It can even help fix defects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is amazing, and rather disconcerting, to realize how much software we run without knowing for sure what it does. We buy software off the shelf in shrink wrapped packages. We run setup utilities that install numerous files, change system settings, delete or disable older versions and superseded utilities, and modify critical registry files. Every time we access a Website, we may invoke or interact with dozens of programs and code segments that are necessary to give us the intended look, feel, and behaviour. We purchase CDs with hundreds of games and utilities or download them as shareware. We exchange useful programs with colleagues and friends when we have tried only a fraction of each program\u2019s features. Then, we download updates and install patches, trusting that the vendors are sure that the changes are correct and complete. We blindly hope that the latest change to each program keeps it compatible with all of the rest of the programs on our system. We rely on much software that we do not understand and do not know very well at all. I refer to a lot more than our desktop or laptop personal computers. The concept of ubiquitous computing, or \u201Csoftware everywhere,\u201D is rapidly putting software control and interconnection in devices throughout our environment. The average automobile now has more lines of software code in its engine controls than were required to land the Apollo astronauts on the Moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMalware analysis is the study of malware\u0027s behaviour. The objective of malware analysis is to understand the working of malware and how to detect and eliminate it. It involves analysing the suspect binary in a safe environment to identify its characteristics and functionalities so that better defences can be built to protect an organization\u0027s network.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImagine if the Trojan Horse was thoroughly inspected and torn down before it was allowed to enter the gates of a city. This would probably cause a few dead soldiers outside the gate fighting for the city. The next time the city is sent another Trojan Horse, archers would know where to point their arrows. And no dead soldiers this time. The same is true for malware analysis\u2014by knowing the behaviours of a certain malware through reverse engineering, the analyst can recommend various safeguards for the network. Think of it as the Trojan Horse being the malware, the analyst being the soldier who initially inspected the horse, and the city being the network of computers.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/reverse-engineering-and-malware-analysis/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4539592_c997_4.jpg","duration":"8.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"38,668.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Beginner Reverse Engineers who curious about learning Reverse Engineering","Beginner Malware Analyst who curious about learning Malware Analysis"],"tags":["Malware","Reverse Engineering"],"rating":{"count":224,"averageValue":"4.1"},"instructors":[{"name":"OCSALY Academy | 390.000\u002B Students - Ethical Hacking","url":"/user/online-academy-of-computer-science/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.05}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"LAST_JULY_2024","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/android-kotlin-development/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5088334,"title":"Android App Development in 34 Hours : MobDevOps\u002B Android 13","shortDescription":"You don\u0027t need 34\u002B hours for learning kotlin!

Either you are preparing yourself to enter into the field of automotive service, or you are expanding your skills to include automotive electrical systems. In either case, congratulations on selecting one of the most fast-paced segments of the automotive industry. Working with the electrical systems can be challenging, yet very rewarding; however, it can also be very frustrating at times. For many people, learning electrical systems can be a struggle. It is my hope that I am able to present the course to you in such a manner that you will not only understand electrical systems, but will excel at it. There are many ways the theory of electricity can be explained, and many metaphors can be used. Some compare electricity to a water flow, while others explain it in a purely scientific fashion. Everyone learns differently. I am presenting electrical theory in a manner that I hope will be clear and concise. If you do not fully comprehend a concept, then it is important to discuss it with your instructor. Electricity is somewhat abstract; so if you do have questions, be sure to ask me in Udemy ask section.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy Become an Electrical System Technician? \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the past, it was possible for technicians to work their entire careers and be able to almost completely avoid the vehicle\u2019s electrical systems. They would specialize in engines, steering/ suspension, or brakes. Today, there is not a system on the vehicle that is immune to the role of electrical circuits. Engine controls, electronic suspension systems, and anti-lock brakes are common on today\u2019s vehicles. Even electrical systems that were once thought of as being simple have evolved to computer controls. Headlights are now pulse-width modulated using high side drivers and will automatically brighten and dim based on the light intensity of oncoming traffic. Today\u2019s vehicles are equipped with twenty or more computers, laser-guided cruise control, sonar park assist, infrared climate control, fiber optics, and radio frequency transponders and decoders. Simple systems have become more computers reliant. For example, the horn circuit on the 2008 Chrysler 300C involves three separate control modules to function. Even the tires have computers involved, with the addition of tire pressure monitoring systems!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday\u2019s technician must possess a full and complete electrical background to be able to succeed. The future will provide great opportunities for those technicians who have prepared themselves properly and learn more with this Car Mechanic Course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the off chance that you\u0027re not especially precisely slanted, you might watch the people who are with appreciation, surprise, and irritation since they have something you don\u0027t: a comprehension of how things work and how things fit together. Whenever they dismantle something, they can reassemble it how it was. Whenever they say that they need to investigate the hood, they can really get the darn thing open. Furthermore, when they need to change a level, they don\u0027t endure ten minutes attempting to sort out which end of the raise is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFortunately, you don\u0027t need to be brought into the world with a wrench in your grasp to know how to fix things \u2014 even things as apparently convoluted as a vehicle. I know; I\u0027ve been there.

All things considered, in the event that you couldn\u0027t actually sort out some way to open the hood, how might you check the oil or the coolant level? That is the reason I start this course with the essentials: straightforward positions that you\u0027ll have to do over and over \u2014 like opening the hood, lifting a vehicle, and replacing a tire. I likewise incorporate guidelines for filling the gas tank yourself (it\u0027s less expensive than full-administration), a reliable technique for dismantling anything and assembling it back once more, and security pointers that each technician \u2014 experienced and amateur \u2014 ought to notice.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/car-repair-auto-mechanic-training/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4624160_7f02_9.jpg","duration":"7.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"63,300.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Beginner Car Mechanics","Auto Mechanic Course Learners","Car Mechanic Training Course","Car Mechanic Training","Automotive Repair Training","Online Auto Mechanic Course","Auto Repair Class","Car Mechanic School"],"tags":["Car Repair"],"rating":{"count":1088,"averageValue":"3.9"},"instructors":[{"name":"OCSALY Academy | 390.000\u002B Students - Ethical Hacking","url":"/user/online-academy-of-computer-science/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"LAST_JULY_2024","originalPrice":"\u20B92,699","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/bootstrapping-business-without-money-investments-getting/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5845088,"title":"Bootstrapping, Business Without Money, Investments Getting","shortDescription":"Bootstrapping, Business Without Money, Investments Getting Course by MTF Institute","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWelcome to course\u003C/strong\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003EBootstrapping, Business Without Money, Investments Getting by MTF Institut\u003C/strong\u003Ee\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThat course is part of Program about Entrepreneurship and Business\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThis course focused on different types of funding of your business, from personal and private investments, investing funds, to launching of business without money.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECourse provided by \u003Cstrong\u003EMTF Institute of Management, Technology and Finance\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMTF\u003C/strong\u003E is the global educational and research institute with HQ at Lisbon, Portugal, focused on business \u0026amp;
