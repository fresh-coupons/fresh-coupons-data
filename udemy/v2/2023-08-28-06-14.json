You will Learn from the best Business and Make Profit !","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EThere\u2019s a HUGE difference between simply operating a used car dealership business and operating a profitable used car dealership. To get a better idea of the possible demand for used cars in your area, you\u2019ll need to crunch some numbers. By knowing the number of used cars sold in your area every year and month , you can estimate what percentage of the market you will be likely to be able to corner and reach. By locating the average profit per vehicle, you can get an approximate idea of how much profit and money your dealership able to make per year. While the groundwork associated with opening a dealership can be time-consuming, expensive, and demanding, the real test of your dealership\u2019s viability doesn\u2019t begin until after you open your doors to the public. Without the right management of your dealership, all the effort you put into laying the foundation will be wasted. While each state has its own rules and regulations, there are several important universal aspects of operating a car dealership and tips on how you can get the most out of your investment. Your customers are the single most important factor in the success or failure of your business, so taking the time to identify who they are and what they care about is absolutely vital. Take a look at the types of cars you plan on selling, then do some research to determine the age, gender, and income level of the average individual who owns those types of vehicles. Later down the line, this will allow you to tailor your marketing and advertising efforts toward those who are most likely to be interested in what you have to offer. Make sure to base any of your conclusions regarding your target clients on real actionable data; don\u2019t simply make assumptions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/car-flipping-earn-money-from-selling-used-cars-ocsaly/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4741312_7b69_3.jpg","duration":"1.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"26,201.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Beginner Used Car Business Leaders"],"tags":["Car Flipping"],"rating":{"count":83,"averageValue":"4.1"},"instructors":[{"name":"OCSALY Academy | 240.000\u002B Students","url":"/user/online-academy-of-computer-science/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":3.9}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"CAR-SELLING-2023","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"2 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-firefox/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":2582622,"title":"Firefox Basics","shortDescription":"Everything you need to know about Firefox!","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESO, YOU\u2019RE LOOKING FOR A COURSE THAT WILL TEACH YOU FIREFOX QUICKLY \u0026amp; IN A FUN MANNER?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u2019ve got just the course for you!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWelcome, my name is Josh Werner with Learn Tech Plus and I\u2019ve put this course together to help people just like you quickly master Firefox...Whether you\u2019re a beginner or a web developer with existing programming knowledge/skills!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your goal is to become a web developer, then this course is perfect for you.

Here, in this course, you will be fascinated by how far artificial intelligence has advanced nowadays. If I told you a couple years ago that you can generate a full podcast and clone your own voice using AI, most likely, you won\u2019t believe those technologies actually exist. Nonetheless, what if I told you that today you can utilise AI to generate a full podcast episode and not only that you can also clone your voice, then, integrate that new voice to your podcast host that was created using AI. For those of you who might assume that the process is going to be very complicated, you are mistaken. As matter of fact, the process is relatively simple and straightforward, all you need to do is to describe what would be the topic of your podcast and do some minor customisations like choosing your podcast host and choosing the voice for that host. Meanwhile, for cloning your voice, all you need to do is to upload an audio file of your sample voice and artificial intelligence will automatically generate the clone version of your voice. In the introduction session, you will learn basic fundamentals of the podcast and you will also get to know several strategies that can be implemented to retain your podcast viewers.Then, continue by going over several podcast topic ideas that you should consider, such as alternate history, science fiction, and politics. Afterward, you will also learn how artificial intelligence can help you to automate and speed up your podcast production process, such as converting text to speech, removing background noise, and generating content scripts for podcasts. In the next session, you will extensively learn the technology behind AI voice cloning as well as get to know more about AI tools that we will be using, such as Speechify, Play HT, and My Vocal AI. Then, we will also go over several podcast hosting platforms that you might want to consider, for example Spotify, Pod Bean, and Cast box. Once you\u2019ve learnt all necessary knowledge about automating podcasts and cloning voice with AI, you will enter the main section of the course which is the project session. In the first project, you will be guided step by step on how to create podcast episodes using AI tools like Pod Bot, Pod Castle, All in Pod, Slayer, Magic Cast, and Pod Pilot. Whereas, in the second project you will learn step by step on how to clone your own voice using Speechify, Play HT, and My Vocal AI. Once both projects have been completed, you will also learn how to monetise your podcast through several business models as well as how to grow your podcast audiences.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, we need to ask ourselves these questions, why should we automate podcast production using AI? And why should we clone our voice? Well, in my opinion, there are many reasons why, first of all, podcasts have been getting a lot of attention in the past few years as more and more people started to get their entertainment, information, and education from podcasts. Therefore, it is definitely not surprising to know that the market value of podcasts in 2023 has reached more than twenty three billion dollars and it is still projected to increase in the next couple years. This is basically a strong indication that podcasts have a bright future and there is a huge potential for you to turn this side hustle into a sustainable business. In addition to that, as artificial intelligence has advanced very rapidly in the past few years, why not integrate AI with podcasts to automate and speed up the production process. Can you imagine how much time and energy that you can potentially save if you utilise AI to its fullest extent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow are things that you can expect to learn from this course:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn basic fundamentals of Podcast and several strategies to retain your podcast views\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how AI can help you to automate and speed up your podcast production process\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn the technology behind cloning voice using AI, from sample voice data collection to speech synthesis\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGet to know several platforms to host your podcast like Spotify, Pod Bean, Pine Cast, Spreaker, and CastBox\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to generate a podcast content using Podbot AI, All in Pod AI, Slayer AI, Magic Cast AI, and Pod Pilot AI\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to convert text to speech using Pod Castle AI\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to remove background noise from the audio using Pod Castle AI\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to clone your voice using Speechify AI, Play HT, and My Vocal AI\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn several business models to monetise your podcast\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn several efficient marketing strategies to promote your podcast and reach broader audience\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/automating-podcast-production-cloning-your-voice-with-ai/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5518034_f880.jpg","duration":"2.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"377.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["People who are interested to start a podcast","People who are interested in incorporating podcast to their contents","People who are interested to clone their voices using AI"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":0,"averageValue":"0.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"Christ Raharja","url":"/user/christ-raharja/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":0}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"3C4660290D5CA5BF3780","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/clojure-course/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":3462434,"title":"Clojure Basics","shortDescription":"Everything you need to know about Clojure Basics","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EHave you always wanted to learn how to do use Clojure but don\u2019t know where to start?\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould you like to build apps with Clojure Basics and bring your apps to life?\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen Clojure Basics is for you!\u0026nbsp; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHi, I\u2019m your instructor Josh Werner and I\u2019ll be leading you through this course.\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClojure is an in-demand skill in 2021.\u0026nbsp; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe course begins with the basics.

With online car repair training, you can become a skilled auto mechanic in just a few short months and kickstart your journey to a successful and fulfilling career !\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EYou are probably taking this course for one of two reasons. Either you are preparing yourself to enter into the field of automotive service, or you are expanding your skills to include automotive electrical systems. In either case, congratulations on selecting one of the most fast-paced segments of the automotive industry. Working with the electrical systems can be challenging, yet very rewarding; however, it can also be very frustrating at times. For many people, learning electrical systems can be a struggle. It is my hope that I am able to present the course to you in such a manner that you will not only understand electrical systems, but will excel at it. There are many ways the theory of electricity can be explained, and many metaphors can be used. Some compare electricity to a water flow, while others explain it in a purely scientific fashion. Everyone learns differently. I am presenting electrical theory in a manner that I hope will be clear and concise. If you do not fully comprehend a concept, then it is important to discuss it with your instructor. Electricity is somewhat abstract; so if you do have questions, be sure to ask me in Udemy ask section.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy Become an Electrical System Technician? \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the past, it was possible for technicians to work their entire careers and be able to almost completely avoid the vehicle\u2019s electrical systems. They would specialize in engines, steering/ suspension, or brakes. Today, there is not a system on the vehicle that is immune to the role of electrical circuits. Engine controls, electronic suspension systems, and anti-lock brakes are common on today\u2019s vehicles. Even electrical systems that were once thought of as being simple have evolved to computer controls. Headlights are now pulse-width modulated using high side drivers and will automatically brighten and dim based on the light intensity of oncoming traffic. Today\u2019s vehicles are equipped with twenty or more computers, laser-guided cruise control, sonar park assist, infrared climate control, fiber optics, and radio frequency transponders and decoders. Simple systems have become more computers reliant. For example, the horn circuit on the 2008 Chrysler 300C involves three separate control modules to function. Even the tires have computers involved, with the addition of tire pressure monitoring systems!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday\u2019s technician must possess a full and complete electrical background to be able to succeed.

Whenever they dismantle something, they can reassemble it how it was. Whenever they say that they need to investigate the hood, they can really get the darn thing open. Furthermore, when they need to change a level, they don\u0027t endure ten minutes attempting to sort out which end of the raise is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFortunately, you don\u0027t need to be brought into the world with a wrench in your grasp to know how to fix things \u2014 even things as apparently convoluted as a vehicle.

It is named after the mathematician Haskell Curry. The language is very expressive and has an elegant strong typing system. The language allows you to write code at a very high level, making it easier to write correct code.
