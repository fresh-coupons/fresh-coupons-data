It is based on the idea that a neural network can learn to automatically learn representations of the data at different levels of abstraction. Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) is a type of deep learning model that is a feedforward artificial neural network model that maps sets of input data onto a set of appropriate outputs. MLP is a supervised learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. MLP is based on the idea that a neural network with multiple layers can learn to automatically learn representations of the data at different levels of abstraction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENatural Language Processing (NLP): \u003C/strong\u003ENatural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of Artificial Intelligence that deals with the interaction between human language and computers. One of the common techniques used in NLP is the term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf). Tf-idf is a statistical measure that reflects the importance of a word in a document or a corpus of documents.

This is a comprehensive project based course where you will learn step by step on how to perform complex analysis and visualization on cryptocurrency market dataset. This course will be focusing mainly on forecasting cryptocurrency prices using three different forecasting models, those are Prophet, time series decomposition, and machine learning particularly we are going to be utilizing Random Forest and XGBoost. Regarding programming language, we are going to use Python alongside with several libraries like Pandas for performing data modeling, Numpy for performing complex calculations, Matplotlib for visualizing the data, and TensorFlow which is an open-source machine learning library used for building and training various deep learning models. Meanwhile, for the data source, we are going to download the crypto market dataset from Kaggle. In the introduction session, you will learn basic fundamentals of cryptocurrency market forecasting, such as getting to know the crypto market characteristics and forecasting models that will be used. Then, continue by learning the basic mathematics behind prophet model and time series decomposition where you will be guided step by step on how to analyze case study and perform basic calculation. This session is intended to prepare your knowledge and understanding before implementing these models in the forecasting project. Afterward, you will also learn several factors which can potentially impact the cryptocurrency market, such as liquidity, market cap, transaction volume, and circulating supply. Once you\u2019ve learnt all necessary knowledge about crypto market forecasting, we will begin the project, firstly you will be guided step by step on how to set up Google Colab since we are going to use it as the IDE in this project, then you will also learn how to find and download datasets from Kaggle. After preparing the IDE and datasets, you will enter the main section of the course which is the project section. The project will be consisted of three parts, the first one is forecasting cryptocurrency market using Prophet model, the second one is forecasting cryptocurrency market using time series decomposition model, meanwhile, the third one is forecasting cryptocurrency market using machine learning models specifically Random Forest and XGBoost. Lastly, at the end of the course, you will also learn how to perform model evaluations to assess the accuracy and quality of your forecasting model.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, before getting into the course, we need to ask ourselves these questions: why should we learn to forecast the crypto market? Is it going to be accurate? Well, there are many answers to those questions. Firstly, both cryptocurrency and big data technology have advanced very rapidly in the past few years, therefore, combining both sounds like a brilliant idea. In addition to that, integrating big data technology especially machine learning and time series will enable us to make more accurate data driven based predictions. Not only that, identifying patterns and trends from the historical data can be used as a good indicator to forecast what will happen in the future. Nonetheless, no matter how advanced or accurate your forecasting model is, you still need to be aware that there is no such thing as 100% accuracy when it comes to forecasting. Last but not least, learning how to forecast can be very valuable knowledge and skill sets since you will be able to implement the same exact concept to other markets like stock market, commodity market, or even real estate market.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow are things that you can expect to learn from the course:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn basic fundamentals of cryptocurrency market forecasting, such as getting to know crypto market characteristics and forecasting models that will be used\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn math and logics behind prophet forecasting model, such as getting to know trend factor, seasonality component, and holiday component\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn math and logics behind time series decomposition model, such as getting to know trend component, seasonal component, and residual component\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to split dataset using Random Forest algorithm and learn how to calculate Gini Impurity\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn several factors that can potentially impact cryptocurrency market, such as circulating supply, transaction volume, liquidity, market cap, and security\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to find and download datasets from Kaggle\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to upload data to Google Colab Studio\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to clean datasets from missing values and duplicate values\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to detect outliers in the dataset\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to analyse and visualise daily and annual price volatility\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to detect market trend and calculate moving average\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to find correlation between price and volume using TensorFlow\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to build forecasting model using Prophet\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to build forecasting model using time series decomposition\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to build forecasting model using machine learning, specifically Random Forest and XGBoost algorithm\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to evaluate the accuracy and quality of the forecasting models using prediction interval coverage, component analysis, and feature importance analysis\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/forecast-crypto-market-with-time-series-machine-learning/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5532648_e35c_2.jpg","duration":"3 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"357.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["People who are interested in forecasting cryptocurrency market using time series and machine learning","People who are interested in financial technology field particularly integrating big data with financial market","People who are interested in analysing and visualising complex dataset using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Numpy"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":0,"averageValue":"0.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"Christ Raharja","url":"/user/christ-raharja/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":0}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"AE42688A735AA0C3A35D","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/nlp-in-python/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":3257648,"title":"2023 Natural Language Processing in Python for Beginners","shortDescription":"Text Cleaning, Spacy, NLTK, Scikit-Learn, Deep Learning, word2vec, GloVe, LSTM for Sentiment, Emotion, Spam \u0026 CV Parsing","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to KGP Talkie\u0027s Natural Language Processing (NLP) course.

Digital cameras\u003Cstrong\u003E \u003C/strong\u003Eare built into doorbells; your smartphone tracks your daily movements from work to home and back; and you receive social media updates when you go to the gym, see a show, or visit a new city. Digital technology tracks your phone calls, bank transactions, and medical appointments. What about criminal or unethical behavior if it tracks your mundane daily activities?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat activity is also monitored, and as a\u003Cstrong\u003E \u003C/strong\u003Edigital forensic investigator, you\u0027ll need to understand where digital evidence is stored and how to analyse it. There is almost no criminal activity that does not involve digital evidence, and it is your responsibility as an investigator to gather all available evidence, process it, and present your findings to the authorities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInvestigators who work in the field of digital forensics must have a diverse set of skills and interests. The first question I ask anyone thinking about a career in this field is if they enjoy solving puzzles. You may not have access to any information other than the fact that something happened when investigating a case. So, if someone needs to be shown or told what happened, this field may not be right for them. When a case is brought to an investigator\u0027s attention, the investigator is often given instructions to figure out what the computer or device was used for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother important trait is the ability to deal with frustration, as investigative tools and software do not always work without problems. When it comes to cell phones and small devices, this is a fairly common occurrence. Many students, rather than working through the challenges, stop their investigation in class at the first sign of difficulty. They don\u0027t even try to figure out what\u0027s wrong with the tool by looking at the web or using the help system. To be a successful investigator, one must be persistent and creative \u2013 they must be problem solvers. Digital forensics is a branch of forensic science that collects, analyses, documents, and presents digital evidence related to computer crime for use in a court of law using scientific knowledge. Knowing what was done, when it was done, and who did it is the ultimate goal. The term \u201Cdigital forensics\u201D is often used interchangeably with \u201Ccomputer forensics\u201D (also known as \u201Ccyber forensics\u201D), but it has come to encompass all devices capable of storing digital data, including networking devices, mobile phones, tablets, digital cameras, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, digital home appliances, and other digital storage media such as CD/DVD, USB drives, SD cards, external drives, and backup tapes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComputer Forensics is a specialization that deals with the recovery, examination and investigation of digital evidence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComputer Forensics is an applied science that deals with the recovery, examination and investigation of digital evidence.

In either case, congratulations on selecting one of the most fast-paced segments of the automotive industry. Working with the electrical systems can be challenging, yet very rewarding; however, it can also be very frustrating at times. For many people, learning electrical systems can be a struggle. It is my hope that I am able to present the course to you in such a manner that you will not only understand electrical systems, but will excel at it. There are many ways the theory of electricity can be explained, and many metaphors can be used. Some compare electricity to a water flow, while others explain it in a purely scientific fashion. Everyone learns differently. I am presenting electrical theory in a manner that I hope will be clear and concise. If you do not fully comprehend a concept, then it is important to discuss it with your instructor. Electricity is somewhat abstract; so if you do have questions, be sure to ask me in Udemy ask section.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy Become an Electrical System Technician? \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the past, it was possible for technicians to work their entire careers and be able to almost completely avoid the vehicle\u2019s electrical systems. They would specialize in engines, steering/ suspension, or brakes. Today, there is not a system on the vehicle that is immune to the role of electrical circuits. Engine controls, electronic suspension systems, and anti-lock brakes are common on today\u2019s vehicles. Even electrical systems that were once thought of as being simple have evolved to computer controls. Headlights are now pulse-width modulated using high side drivers and will automatically brighten and dim based on the light intensity of oncoming traffic. Today\u2019s vehicles are equipped with twenty or more computers, laser-guided cruise control, sonar park assist, infrared climate control, fiber optics, and radio frequency transponders and decoders. Simple systems have become more computers reliant. For example, the horn circuit on the 2008 Chrysler 300C involves three separate control modules to function. Even the tires have computers involved, with the addition of tire pressure monitoring systems!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday\u2019s technician must possess a full and complete electrical background to be able to succeed.

Whenever they dismantle something, they can reassemble it how it was. Whenever they say that they need to investigate the hood, they can really get the darn thing open. Furthermore, when they need to change a level, they don\u0027t endure ten minutes attempting to sort out which end of the raise is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFortunately, you don\u0027t need to be brought into the world with a wrench in your grasp to know how to fix things \u2014 even things as apparently convoluted as a vehicle.

Kotlin has classes with constructors, along with nested, inner, and anonymous inner classes, and it has interfaces like Java 8. Kotlin does \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E have a new keyword. To create a class instance, call the constructor just like a regular function. We saw that in the screenshot above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKotlin has single inheritance from a named superclass, and all Kotlin classes have a default superclass Any, which is \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E the same as the Java base class java.lang.Object. Any contains only three predefined member functions: equals(), hashCode(), and toString().\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKotlin classes have to be marked with the open keyword in order to allow other classes to inherit from them; Java classes are kind of the opposite, as they are inheritable \u003Cem\u003Eunless\u003C/em\u003E marked with the final keyword. To override a superclass method, the method itself must be marked open, and the subclass method must be marked override. This is all of a piece with Kotlin\u2019s philosophy of making things explicit rather than relying on defaults. In this particular case, I can see where Kotlin\u2019s way of explicitly marking base class members as open for inheritance and derived class members as overrides avoids several kinds of common Java errors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, you\u0027ll learn how to create apps and run them on virtual devices through guided exercises. You\u0027ll cover the fundamentals of Android development, from structuring an app to building out the UI with Activities and Fragments and various navigation patterns. Progressing through the chapters and lectures, you\u0027ll delve into Android\u0027s RecyclerView to make the most of displaying lists of data and become comfortable with fetching data from a web service and handling images. You\u0027ll then learn about mapping, location services, and the permissions model before working with notifications and how to persist data. Moving on, you\u0027ll get to grips with testing, covering the full spectrum of the test pyramid. You\u0027ll also learn how AAC (Android Architecture Components) are used to cleanly structure your code and explore various architecture patterns and the benefits of dependency injection. \u003Cem\u003EThe core libraries of RxJava and Coroutines are covered for asynchronous programming\u003C/em\u003E. The focus then returns to the UI, demonstrating how to add motion and transitions when users interact with your apps. Towards the end, you\u0027ll build an interesting app to retrieve and display popular movies from a movie database, and then see how to publish your apps on Google Play.

If so, then this course is for you\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen Android first arrived in 2008, it was a bit drab compared to the much more stylish iOS on the Apple iPhone/iPad. But, quite quickly, through a variety of handset offers that struck a chord with practical, price-conscious consumers, as well as those who are fashion-conscious and tech-savvy, Android user numbers exploded. For many, myself included, developing for Android is the most rewarding pastime and business, bar none. Quickly putting together a prototype of an idea, refining it, and then deciding to run with it and wire it up into a fully-fledged app, is such an exciting and rewarding process. Any programming can be fun \u2013 I have been programming all my life \u2013 but creating for Android is somehow extraordinarily rewarding..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKotlin is the most succinct language, and therefore is the least error-prone, \u003Cem\u003Ewhich is great for beginners\u003C/em\u003E. Kotlin is also the most fun language, mainly because the succinctness means you can get results faster and with less code. Google considers Kotlin an official (first-class) Android language.

We will discover the details of these advantages as we proceed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKotlin is an object-oriented language. This means that it uses the concept of reusable programming objects.

The term digital forensics was originally used as a synonym for \u003Cstrong\u003Ecomputer forensics\u003C/strong\u003E but has expanded to cover investigation of all devices capable of storing digital data. With roots in the personal computing revolution of the late 1970s and early 1980s, the discipline evolved in a haphazard manner during the 1990s, and it was not until the early 21st century that national policies emerged.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDigital forensics investigations have a variety of applications. The most common is to support or refute a hypothesis before criminal or civil courts. Criminal cases involve the alleged breaking of laws that are defined by legislation and that are enforced by the police and prosecuted by the state, such as theft and assault against the person. Civil cases on the other hand deal with protecting the rights and property of individuals (often associated with family disputes) but may also be concerned with contractual disputes between commercial entities where a form of digital forensics referred to as electronic discovery (discovery) may be involved\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring the 1980s very few specialized digital forensic tools existed, and consequently investigators often performed live analysis on media, examining computers from within the operating system using existing sysadmin tools to extract evidence. This practice carried the risk of modifying data on the disk, either inadvertently or otherwise, which led to claims of evidence tampering. A number of tools were created during the early 1990s to address the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDigital forensics is commonly used in both criminal law and private investigation. Traditionally it has been associated with criminal law, where evidence is collected to support or oppose a hypothesis before the courts. As with other areas of forensics this is often a part of a wider investigation spanning a number of disciplines. In some cases, the collected evidence is used as a form of intelligence gathering, used for other purposes than court proceedings (for example to locate, identify or halt other crimes). As a result, intelligence gathering is sometimes held to a less strict forensic standard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you enroll in our Digital Forensics Masterclass | Forensic Science 2023 DFMC, you\u0027ll not only learn about the fundamentals of digital forensics, but so much more!

To get a better idea of the possible demand for used cars in your area, you\u2019ll need to crunch some numbers. By knowing the number of used cars sold in your area every year and month , you can estimate what percentage of the market you will be likely to be able to corner and reach. By locating the average profit per vehicle, you can get an approximate idea of how much profit and money your dealership able to make per year. While the groundwork associated with opening a dealership can be time-consuming, expensive, and demanding, the real test of your dealership\u2019s viability doesn\u2019t begin until after you open your doors to the public. Without the right management of your dealership, all the effort you put into laying the foundation will be wasted. While each state has its own rules and regulations, there are several important universal aspects of operating a car dealership and tips on how you can get the most out of your investment. Your customers are the single most important factor in the success or failure of your business, so taking the time to identify who they are and what they care about is absolutely vital. Take a look at the types of cars you plan on selling, then do some research to determine the age, gender, and income level of the average individual who owns those types of vehicles. Later down the line, this will allow you to tailor your marketing and advertising efforts toward those who are most likely to be interested in what you have to offer. Make sure to base any of your conclusions regarding your target clients on real actionable data; don\u2019t simply make assumptions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/car-flipping-earn-money-from-selling-used-cars-ocsaly/","imageUri":"https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4741312_7b69_3.jpg","duration":"1.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"26,601.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Beginner Used Car Business Leaders"],"tags":["Car Flipping"],"rating":{"count":91,"averageValue":"3.8"},"instructors":[{"name":"OCSALY Academy | 250.000\u002B Students","url":"/user/online-academy-of-computer-science/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":3.9411764}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"CAR-BUYING-2023-SEP","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"3 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/instagram-marketing-2021-growth-and-promotion-on-instagram/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":3717522,"title":"Instagram Marketing 2021: Growth and Promotion on Instagram","shortDescription":"Use Instagram to Target and Attract the right Followers to Grow your Account | Convert Followers into Loyal Clients","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EGrowing on social media can sometimes be very complicated, especially if you have no prior experience and this field.

The goal of computer forensics is to perform a structured investigation and maintain a documented chain of evidence to find out exactly what happened on a computing device and who was responsible for it. Computer forensics -- which is sometimes referred to as computer forensic science essentially is data recovery with legal compliance guidelines to make the information admissible in legal proceedings. The terms digital forensics and cyber forensics are often used as synonyms for computer forensics. Digital forensics starts with the collection of information in a way that maintains its integrity. Investigators then analyze the data or system to determine if it was changed, how it was changed and who made the changes. The use of computer forensics isn\u0027t always tied to a crime. The forensic process is also used as part of data recovery processes to gather data from a crashed server, failed drive, reformatted operating system (OS) or other situation where a system has unexpectedly stopped working.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy is computer forensics important?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the civil and criminal justice system, computer forensics helps ensure the integrity of digital evidence presented in court cases.

And his pronunciation is very clear and easy to understand. Also his sentences are spoken with the emphasis in the right places. This course is designed for native speakers of English. The same basic principles could probably be applied in a course designed for non-native speakers. I would like to see such a course someday. I am really enjoying this course.

He makes every other course seem like a prologue and I know I am going to be the confident, well prepared speaker that I always sought to become. The magnitude of material and the pieces of golden wisdom are so practical to today\u0027s environment. It hardly seems possible that a teacher of this quality would be so giving and available to the average person like myself, when he is qualified to coach Kings and Dignitaries. Only one-third through the course and already my Charity fundraising efforts are more effective because I have gained skills to improve my communication, both my message and my delivery.
