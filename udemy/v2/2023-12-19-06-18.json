It ensures reliable transmission of data across the physical network by employing mechanisms like frame synchronization, MAC addressing, and error control. Error control includes both error detection and error correction, which are achieved through techniques like parity checks and Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC). These processes help identify and rectify errors that might occur at the physical layer, enhancing overall data integrity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EQuestion:\u003C/strong\u003E In a network using IPv4 addressing, what is the purpose of subnetting?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA) To enhance network security\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB) To reduce the number of IP addresses needed\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EC) To divide an IP network into multiple network segments\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ED) To increase the speed of the network\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAnswer:\u003C/strong\u003E C) To divide an IP network into multiple network segments\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EExplanation:\u003C/strong\u003E Subnetting, in the context of IPv4, is the process of dividing a single network into multiple smaller, more manageable network segments or sub-networks. This practice allows for more efficient use of IP addresses, reducing the wastage associated with large address blocks. Subnetting enhances network organization, improves security by isolating network segments, and can improve performance by reducing local traffic. However, its primary purpose is not to increase the speed of the network or reduce the overall number of IP addresses but to create logically segmented networks within a larger network.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EQuestion:\u003C/strong\u003E What is the primary function of a network firewall?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA) To act as a distribution point for data packets\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB) To connect multiple network segments\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EC) To monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ED) To provide dynamic IP addresses to devices\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAnswer:\u003C/strong\u003E C) To monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EExplanation:\u003C/strong\u003E A network firewall serves as a security barrier between your internal network and external sources, such as the internet. Its primary function is to monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. By doing so, firewalls help prevent unauthorized access to or from a network, safeguarding data and resources. Firewalls can be hardware-based, software-based, or a combination of both, and are essential components in a comprehensive network security strategy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EQuestion:\u003C/strong\u003E Which protocol is used to securely manage network devices remotely?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA) HTTP\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB) SNMP\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EC) SSH\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ED) FTP\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAnswer:\u003C/strong\u003E C) SSH\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EExplanation:\u003C/strong\u003E Secure Shell (SSH) is the protocol used for securely accessing network devices remotely.

SSH is widely used for managing network infrastructure and systems due to its robust security features.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EQuestion:\u003C/strong\u003E What does the term \u0027QoS\u0027 stand for in networking, and what is its primary purpose?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA) Quality of Service; to ensure efficient data transfer\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB) Quick Operating System; to speed up network device operations\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EC) Query Optimization System; to enhance database queries over a network\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ED) Queue of Signals; to manage data packet queuing\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAnswer:\u003C/strong\u003E A) Quality of Service; to ensure efficient data transfer\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EExplanation:\u003C/strong\u003E Quality of Service (QoS) in networking refers to the various technologies and techniques used to manage and prioritize network traffic to ensure the efficient transmission of data. The primary purpose of QoS is to provide priority, including dedicated bandwidth, controlled jitter and latency (required by some real-time and interactive traffic), and improved loss characteristics. It is used to ensure that the most important data gets through the network as quickly and smoothly as possible, even in high traffic situations or when bandwidth is limited.

Multithreading allows multiple threads to execute concurrently, making better use of CPU resources. This results in more tasks being completed in the same amount of time, thereby increasing throughput. Options B, C, and D are benefits associated with multithreading, but they are not specific to CPU-bound processes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhich of the following is a potential disadvantage of multithreading?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA.

It acts as a signaling mechanism that restricts the number of threads that can access a resource or a pool of resources concurrently. By doing so, semaphores help prevent resource conflicts and ensure thread safety. Options A, B, and D, while relevant to multithreading, are not the primary functions of a semaphore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHow does thread-local storage (TLS) benefit multithreading?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA.
