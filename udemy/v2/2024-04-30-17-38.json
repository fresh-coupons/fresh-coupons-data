There are different busbar electrode combinations, there\u0027s a different voltage range and conductor gap information, there\u0027s information about the box, the height, the width, and the depth, and how they use that enclosure box to calculate the instant energy levels. There\u0027s the arcing current variation corrective factor that goes into a lot of detail, there is arc flash test, the continuous voltage spectrum, the enclosure size and correction factor, the table of equipment and class types, the minimum arcing current adjustments, and the 125 kVA transformer cutoff whatever happened to that, so we\u0027ll talk about that as well.
