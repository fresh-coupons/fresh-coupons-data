They also learn about best practices for securing web servers and databases.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOnce students have gained a strong understanding of server deployment and security, the course covers server scaling. Here, students learn how to scale their Linode server by adding resources such as CPU, RAM, and storage. Students also learn about load balancing and auto-scaling, which are important concepts for ensuring high availability and scalability of cloud-based applications.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe course then dives into server images and backups. Students learn how to create and restore server images, which are useful for deploying pre-configured servers quickly. They will also learn about backup strategies and best practices for ensuring data reliability.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe next topic covered in the course is PHP foundations. Students learn about the PHP programming language, including syntax, data types, and control structures. They also gain practical experience by writing and executing PHP scripts.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EFinally, the course will culminate with students building a members-only blog using PHP and MySQL. Students will apply the knowledge they have gained throughout the course by creating a web application that requires user authentication and allows users to create and edit blog posts. They will also learn about best practices for designing and developing web applications.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThis course is designed to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of cloud computing, server deployment, and web application development. Students will gain practical experience by deploying virtual servers in the cloud, configuring web servers and databases, and building web applications using PHP and MySQL. By the end of the course, students will have the skills and knowledge necessary to deploy and maintain cloud-based applications with confidence.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/linode-build-a-scalable-blog-app-using-php-mysql-db/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5037450_d470.jpg","duration":"11 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"21,674.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["IT professionals who want to expand their knowledge of cloud computing and server deployment.","Web developers who want to learn how to deploy web applications on the cloud using Linode.","Entrepreneurs and small business owners who want to learn how to manage and maintain their own cloud-based applications.","Students pursuing a degree in computer science, information technology, or related fields.","Anyone interested in learning more about cloud computing and server deployment, regardless of their technical background."],"tags":["Cloud Computing","LAMP Stack","PHP"],"rating":{"count":80,"averageValue":"4.6"},"instructors":[{"name":"YouAccel Training","url":"/user/youaccel/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.590909}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"YOUACCEL68211","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"1 day","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/php-beginner-to-advanced/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4740064,"title":"PHP Tutorial Beginner to Advanced","shortDescription":"Learn everything you need to start a successful career as a PHP developer","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWHY PHP\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPHP is used in \u003Cstrong\u003Emore than 70 percent\u003C/strong\u003E of the websites across the Internet.

This course offers a comprehensive guide into one of the most powerful, modern JavaScript libraries available - ReactJS. Whether you are completely new to React, or you\u2019ve dabbled with it in the past, one thing\u2019s for sure - You\u2019ve likely interacted with a number of web applications that use the React library for building out user interface components. Some of the most well known examples include Netflix, Facebook, and Airbnb. Developed and maintained by Meta along with a community of independent developers, React remains free and open-source. React is a component based library built entirely on JavaScript, which makes it perfect for designing complex UI\u2019s. With React, developers can build encapsulated components that efficiently manage their own state and render UI updates specifically when data changes. For example, think of the automated content refresh feature you see on a twitter feed, or Facebook like button. Here, the state of the UI component changes on the page without having to manually refresh when the data is updated. This is just one small, yet powerful UI feature built into React.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThis course starts with exploring the foundations of React and its core use cases. We offer a concise definition of what React is and what it\u2019s not. From there, we explore the tools needed to get started along with an introduction into JSX, and Functional React components. Through a complete hands-on project you will learn a number of important concepts including react props, callbacks, OnClick Events and passing parameters within callback functions. By the end of module one you will have built a fully functional calculator, complete with display and numerical operators. We will also cover important topics such as the React State Hook, and Debugging.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn the second module students build out a multiplayer Connect-4 clone, with AI integration. Here we start with styling the individual game board components followed by advanced onClickEvents. This includes global, dynamic and inline styling. From there, we move on to passing props, destructing, and React children. Students will explore the React key property, along with Lifecycle events, game initialization, CSS variables, and conditional rendering. By the end, you will have built a complete Connect-4 game capable of automatically determining the winner in both a multi-player and AI based single player setting.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn module three we further unleash the power of React by building out a complete e-commerce site with multiple product categories, a product showcase, shopping cart feature, and much more. Here, we introduce a number of integral new concepts including: JSON server, Fetch API, and installing React router. These essential building blocks will be used to render the product categories, style the product list, and configure the product details page. From there we dive into styled components, refactoring the shop layout, and exploring the concept of \u201Ccontext\u201D in React. In the final stages of the project students will configure the shopping cart basket, and the integrated checkout feature. We will also implement a product search feature, followed by in-depth exercises on validating input forms in React.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAs you can see this course covers a tremendous bit of ground.

If the model predictions deviate significantly from real world scenarios, it could have catastrophic results for both an organization and its customers. In such a scenario, it becomes extremely important to have well defined, preventive and detective guardrails around model development and use. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrganizations have done model risk management in one form or the other, but the overarching principles and framework has started shaping in the last decade. In April 2011, the US Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System published the Supervisory Guidance on Model Risk Management (SR 11-7). With the recent advances in Machine Learning \u0026amp; Artificial Intelligence and the introduction of generative AI like GPT-4 and DALL\u00B7E, government and regulatory bodies around the world are showing tremendous interest in strengthening existing regulations or introducing new ones. On 17th May 2023, the Prudential Regulatory Authority of Bank of England published SS 1/23 Model Risk Management principles for banks in UK covering traditional banking models as well as Machine Learning and AI models.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis course gives an overview of Model Governance and Risk Management principles and can serve as a high level guide to implement or harden model governance and risk management processes for your organization or clients.
