We will explore how coaching knowledge is pivotal for career development, the responsibilities of middle and top managers in preparing and mentoring personal development plans for team members, and the critical role of coaching in internal education and employee development. Additionally, we will examine how coaching methods contribute to the mental health and well-being of employees, acting as a vital support system for individuals who may have limited access to other sources of guidance.","The Transformation of Managerial Roles  1.1 Evolving Leadership Expectations  The traditional image of a manager as a stern authority figure has given way to a more holistic view of leadership. Managers are now expected to serve as role models, motivators, and mentors to their teams. This shift stems from the recognition that employees perform at their best when they feel valued, supported, and empowered.  The evolution of leadership expectations can be traced back to the changing dynamics of the modern workplace. In the past, managers were primarily responsible for enforcing rules and ensuring productivity. However, as organizations began to realize that employee engagement and satisfaction were crucial for success, a transformation in managerial roles ensued.  Today, managers are not just tasked with overseeing tasks and projects; they are expected to inspire and empower their teams. This shift is partly a response to the changing nature of work itself.

They actively listen to understand the unique challenges and aspirations of each employee, fostering a sense of trust and rapport.

It encourages them to take the initiative, think critically, and develop problem-solving skills\u2014a valuable asset in today\u0027s fast-paced, ever-changing business landscape.
