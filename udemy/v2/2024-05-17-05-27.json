It encourages them to take the initiative, think critically, and develop problem-solving skills\u2014a valuable asset in today\u0027s fast-paced, ever-changing business landscape.  Coaching also plays a crucial role in setting and achieving goals. Effective managers use coaching techniques to collaboratively define clear, actionable objectives with their team members. This process not only aligns individual efforts with organizational goals but also empowers employees to track their progress and make necessary adjustments along the way.","Coaching Knowledge for Career Development  Career Development in the Modern Workplace  Career development is a top priority for employees. Discover how coaching knowledge equips managers with the tools to help team members navigate their career paths, set meaningful goals, and continually improve their skills.  Career development has evolved from being a peripheral concern to a central focus in the modern workplace. In an era marked by rapid technological advancements and industry disruptions, employees recognize the importance of continuous learning and skill enhancement to remain relevant and competitive.  This heightened emphasis on career development places managers at the forefront of helping their team members chart their professional journeys. Coaching knowledge equips managers with the ability to provide guidance that is not only aligned with the organization\u0027s needs but also tailored to the aspirations of individual employees.  One of the key advantages of coaching in career development is its ability to facilitate self-awareness. Effective coaches help employees identify their strengths, weaknesses, interests, and values. Armed with this self-knowledge, employees can make informed career decisions that align with their passions and long-term goals.","The Manager as a Career Development Partner  Explore the responsibilities of middle and top managers in preparing and mentoring personal development plans for their team members. Learn how these plans can align with organizational objectives and create a win-win situation for both employees and the company.  Managers who actively engage in career development become indispensable partners in their employees\u0027 professional growth. They play a pivotal role in creating personalized development plans that leverage individual strengths and address areas needing improvement.  These development plans not only benefit the employees but also the organization. By aligning individual development goals with the company\u0027s strategic objectives, managers ensure that every team member\u0027s growth contributes to the overall success of the business.  Furthermore, coaching techniques are instrumental in fostering a growth mindset within teams. Managers can use coaching to encourage employees to embrace challenges, persist in the face of setbacks, and view failures as opportunities for learning and improvement. This mindset shift has a profound impact on team performance and innovation.","Coaching for Internal Education and Employee Development  The Role of Managers in Internal Education  Managers often bear the responsibility of nurturing a culture of learning within their teams and organizations. Explore how coaching methods can be instrumental in identifying and addressing skill gaps, fostering innovation, and supporting ongoing employee development.  Organizations that prioritize learning and development gain a competitive edge. Managers are at the forefront of this initiative, serving as the catalysts for continuous improvement and innovation within their teams.  Coaching methods play a pivotal role in identifying and addressing skill gaps. By regularly assessing the competencies of their team members, managers can tailor training and development programs to bridge these gaps effectively. This proactive approach not only enhances individual skills but also bolsters the organization\u0027s overall capabilities.  Moreover, coaching encourages a culture of innovation. Effective coaches inspire creativity and critical thinking in their teams. They challenge employees to question the status quo, explore new ideas, and experiment with novel approaches. In this way, managers act as innovation champions, driving progress and adaptability.","Coaching as a Tool for Employee Empowerment  Employee empowerment is a cornerstone of effective leadership. Coaching techniques provide managers with the tools to empower their team members by fostering a sense of ownership and autonomy in their roles.  One of the primary ways coaching empowers employees is by promoting self-directed learning. Instead of relying solely on formal training programs, employees learn to identify their development needs and take initiative in seeking resources and opportunities for growth. Managers who coach effectively encourage this proactive approach.  Furthermore, coaching cultivates a growth-oriented mindset among employees. When team members receive regular feedback, both positive and constructive, they become more receptive to continuous improvement. They view challenges as opportunities for growth and development, which ultimately leads to higher levels of engagement and performance.  By creating an environment where continuous learning is celebrated, managers inspire their teams to thrive in an ever-changing business landscape. This culture of learning becomes a strategic advantage for organizations, as it enables them to adapt quickly to new challenges and opportunities.","Coaching for Mental Health and Well-being  The Manager as a Trusted Support System  For many employees, especially those who live alone or lack a strong support network, a manager can become their most trusted confidant. Understand how coaching methods extend beyond professional development to support the mental health and well-being of team members.  The relationship between a manager and their team members extends beyond the confines of the workplace. In some cases, a manager may be the primary source of support for an employee, especially when they are facing personal challenges or seeking guidance related to their mental health and well-being.  Coaching methods are not limited to career development; they encompass the whole spectrum of an employee\u0027s life. Effective managers create an environment where team members feel comfortable discussing personal challenges and seeking guidance when needed. This trust and openness are essential for maintaining employee well-being.  In situations where employees are dealing with stress, anxiety, or other mental health issues, managers with coaching skills can provide valuable support. They can listen empathetically, offer guidance on stress management techniques, and help employees access appropriate resources for professional help when necessary.","Coaching for Life Questions and Personal Challenges  Life is filled with complexities, and employees often grapple with personal challenges that can affect their work performance and overall well-being. Managers who are skilled in coaching can offer valuable guidance during these times of need.  One area where coaching is particularly beneficial is work-life balance. In today\u0027s fast-paced world, employees often struggle to juggle their professional and personal responsibilities. Managers can use coaching techniques to help team members set boundaries, manage their time effectively, and achieve a healthier work-life balance.  Coaching also proves invaluable in navigating interpersonal relationships, both within and outside the workplace. Managers can offer insights into effective communication, conflict resolution, and building positive relationships, which can significantly impact an employee\u0027s overall quality of life.  In times of personal crisis or uncertainty, such as major life transitions or unexpected challenges, employees may turn to their managers for guidance. Managers trained in coaching can provide a supportive and non-judgmental space for employees to explore their feelings, identify potential solutions, and develop action plans to address these challenges.","coaching techniques have become indispensable in the modern workplace, particularly within the roles of managers and leaders. These skills not only drive career development and internal education but also play a crucial role in supporting the mental health and well-being of employees.  As we navigate an ever-changing professional landscape, organizations that recognize the importance of coaching will not only foster a culture of continuous improvement but also cultivate a loyal and motivated workforce. Managers who embrace coaching as a core aspect of their leadership style will not only elevate their own careers but also become catalysts for the success of their teams and organizations as a whole.

In addition to a theoretical deep dive, the course demonstrates how to install, configure, and secure LAMP stack on Ubuntu for hosting dynamic, database driven web apps. We offer a detailed segment on server security, where students will configure both software and network firewalls for their instance using strict firewall policies, UFW and custom SSH ports.

In this course you will learn how to use JavaScript along with two powerful JavaScript libraries to build dynamic, interactive web pages. We start with introducing students to the document object model (DOM) which defines the logical structure of HTML documents. From there we dive into JavaScript to demonstrate various methods in which DOM elements can be manipulated to add interactivity to static components. The JavaScript section starts right from the basics, which includes JavaScript placement, and data output. From there we move on to variable declaration, arithmetic operations, operator precedence, data types, and objects. Once the foundations are covered, we move on to more complex operations using Arrays, Conditional Statements, JavaScript comparison operators, booleans and loops. Here students will learn to unleash the true power of JavaScript to render different outcomes based on user interaction. We will explore the use of functions to efficiently handle repetitive tasks and JavaScript events to handle output based on actions and occurrences. The section will conclude with a hands-on project where students will implement their knowledge to build a web based photo gallery and background color changer.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn the second section of this course, students will learn to work with jQuery - a powerful JavaScript library designed to simplify HTML DOM tree traversal and manipulation. jQuery is ultra lightweight, feature rich, and cross-platform compatible. It\u2019s one of the easiest libraries to work with for building out JavaScript features on an HTML web page. jQuery is excellent for event handling, CSS animations, and Ajax integration for asynchronous UI state changes. Similar to the JavaScript section, the jQuery module begins with the foundations. This includes instructions on embedding jQuery to a web page, and an intro into jQuery syntax. Students will learn to work with jQuery selectors, events, and toggling. From there we dive into animations using fades, slides, and the jQuery animate function. Students also learn about chaining, draggable objects, callback functions, the get content method, toggling classes, and filtering. By the end of the jQuery module, you will know how to build stunning animated web pages with ease.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn the last section of this course we\u2019ll explore React - a cutting edge JavaScript library for building state-of-the art user interface components. You\u2019ve likely seen React in action on some of the hottest web apps developed by fortune 500 companies. For example, Netflix, Facebook, and AirBnB all use React for their front-end UI. As a matter of fact, React was developed by Meta alongside a community of independent developers. Until this day, React remains free and open-source so it has plenty of support and documentation. Unlike jQuery which interacts with the document object model directly, React works through a \u201Cvirtual\u201D DOM. React is unaware of changes made to the DOM outside of React and determines updates based on its own internal representations. React is best for creating reusable code blocks for UI components and layering them on top of each other to minimize the number of times the DOM needs to be re-rendering on state changes. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe React section of this course starts off with a hands-on project where you\u2019ll learn how to work with functional React components, props, Callback functions, OnClick Events, and the React State hook to build a fully functional calculator. From there we will dive into project number two, where you will build a connect-4 clone. Here we will cover more intermediate concepts including passing props, destructuring, passing arguments to click events, various styling methods, and handling callbacks. You will also learn about the React key property, React lifecycle events, and conditional rendering. By the end you will have built a complete multi and single player connect-4 game board with built-in AI capabilities. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn the final section of the course we further unleash the power of React by building out a complete e-commerce site with multiple product categories, a product showcase, shopping cart feature, and much more. Here, we introduce a number of integral new concepts including: JSON server, Fetch API, and installing React router. These essential building blocks will be used to render the product categories, style the product list, and configure the product details page. From there we dive into styled components, refactoring the shop layout, and exploring the concept of \u201Ccontext\u201D in React. In the final stages of the project students will configure the shopping cart basket, and the checkout feature. We will also implement a product search feature, followed by in-depth exercises on validating input forms in React.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAs you can see this course covers a tremendous bit of ground. Best of all it\u2019s co-authored by Tim Maclachlan - a renowned senior full-stack developer with over 20 years of commercial development experience. As a multi-faceted developer, Tim specializes in algorithmic, analytical and mobile development. To date, he\u2019s written hundreds of applications and worked in a number of industries from commercial aviation and military, to banking and finance. Tim has a genuine passion for teaching others how to become better coders and looks forward to interacting with his students.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWith that said, we hope you\u2019re just as excited about this course as we are, if so - hit that enroll button and let\u2019s get started.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-javascript-jquery-and-react-bootcamp-hands-on/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4789948_a375.jpg","duration":"13 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"49,856.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Students interested in working with Popular JavaScript Libraries","Students interested in Building Interactive UI Components using React and jQuery","Students interested in Mastering Front-End Development using JavaScript"],"tags":["JavaScript","jQuery","React JS"],"rating":{"count":335,"averageValue":"4.6"},"instructors":[{"name":"YouAccel Training","url":"/user/youaccel/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.5}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"YOUACCEL24236","originalPrice":"\u20B91,999","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"3 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/professional-diploma-in-business-english-and-communications/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5770034,"title":"Professional Diploma in Business English and Communications","shortDescription":"Professional Diploma in Business English and Communications by MTF Institute","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWelcome to course: Professional Diploma in Business English and Communications by MTF Institute\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECourse provided by \u003Cstrong\u003EMTF Institute of Management, Technology and Finance\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMTF\u003C/strong\u003E is the global educational and research institute with HQ at Lisbon, Portugal, focused on business \u0026amp; professional hybrid (on-campus and online) education at areas: Business \u0026amp; Administration, Science \u0026amp; Technology, Banking \u0026amp; Finance. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMTF R\u0026amp;D \u003C/strong\u003Ecenter focused on research activities at areas: Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Data Science, Big Data, WEB3, Blockchain, Cryptocurrency \u0026amp; Digital Assets, Metaverses, Digital Transformation, Fintech, Electronic Commerce, Internet of Things. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMTF\u003C/strong\u003E is the official partner of: IBM, Intel, Microsoft, member of the Portuguese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and resident of the incubator \u0022The Fintech House of Portugal\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMTF \u003C/strong\u003Eis present in 208 countries and has been chosen by more than 380,000 students.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBusiness English differs from common English in terms of vocabulary, tone, and communication style, as it is specifically tailored for professional settings and interactions within the business world. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are some key differences and reasons why learning Business English and Communications is important for companies and professionals:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EProfessional Vocabulary:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBusiness English incorporates specialized vocabulary related to industries, corporate functions, and specific job roles.

With this course you have the opportunity to relive this fond childhood memory by building a connect-4 clone using React. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EReact, also known as React JS, is a powerful JavaScript library used for building custom, interactive user interfaces using UI components. Some of the most well known examples of organizations using React for their front-end include Netflix, Facebook, and Airbnb. Developed and maintained by Meta along with a community of independent developers, React remains free and open-source. React is a component based library built entirely on JavaScript, which makes it perfect for designing complex UI\u2019s. With React, developers can build encapsulated components that efficiently manage their own state and render UI updates specifically when data changes. For example, think of the automated content refresh feature you see on a twitter feed, or Facebook like button. Here the state of the UI component changes on the page, without having to manually refresh when the data is updated. This is just one small, yet powerful feature of React.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThrough a complete hands-on project, this course will teach you all the fundamental principles of React that you must know to become a proficient React developer. We start with the tools needed to get started with React, along with instructions on creating the Connect-4 game board. From there we dive in to React OnClick Events, Passing Props, Destructing, React Children, and Passing Arguments. With a solid understanding of the foundations, students move on to various styling techniques for the game components, along with Dynamic classes, and handling callbacks. Here we\u2019ll explore inline, global, and dynamic styling coupled with dynamic classes. We will then move on to the React State Hook, React Key Property and initializing the game modules. Students then tackle more intermediate concepts including the logical components of calculating a winner, determining a draw, and React Lifecycle events. In the last module, we explore the implementation of AI for automated move suggestions, and single player games.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn addition to the hands-on React module, we also offer a comprehensive overview of JavaScript for those who need a refresher. Here we start with introducing students to the document object model (DOM) which defines the logical structure of HTML documents. From there we dive into JavaScript to demonstrate various methods in which DOM elements can be manipulated to add interactivity to static components. We start right from the basics, which includes JavaScript placement, and data output. From there we move on to variable declaration, arithmetic operations, operator precedence, data types, and objects. Once the foundations are covered, we move on to more complex operations using Arrays, Conditional Statements, JavaScript comparison operators, Booleans and loops. Here students will learn to unleash the true power of JavaScript to render different outcomes based on user interaction. We will explore the use of functions to efficiently handle repetitive tasks and JavaScript events to handle output based on actions and occurrences. The section will conclude with a hands-on project where students will implement their knowledge to build a web based photo gallery and background color changer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/build-a-connect-4-clone-in-react-javascript-foundations/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4789918_7294.jpg","duration":"5.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"40,114.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Students interested in learning how to build interactive web pages using JavaScript","Students interested in learning ReactJS","Students interested in front-end UI Development using React","Students interested in learning JavaScript Foundations"],"tags":["JavaScript","React JS"],"rating":{"count":150,"averageValue":"4.6"},"instructors":[{"name":"YouAccel Training","url":"/user/youaccel/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.4615383}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"YOUACCEL24236","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"3 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/adobe-lightroom-classic-cc-the-map-book-module/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4900680,"title":"Adobe Lightroom Classic CC: The Map \u0026 Book Module","shortDescription":"Geotag Images | Filter and Save Locations | Book Settings | Book Layout | Text Formatting | Backgrounds | Exporting","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003ELightroom is an intuitive photo editing application used by both enthusiasts and professional photographers.
