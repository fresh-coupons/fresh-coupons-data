It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables.

Even if you\u2019re just looking to build profile, you need a strong internet presence, if you want people to know you exist. The purpose of Digital Marketing is to raise awareness, connect with people who are interested in what you\u2019re offering, and persuade them to take actions you want. It uses digital forms of communication, like the web, smartphones, social media platforms, and search engines, as a medium to reach potential customers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust like traditional marketing, digital marketing is about finding prospective customers and broadcasting your message to them in the right place, in the right tone, and at the right time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDigital Marketing has one major advantage over traditional marketing, as you can use analytics tools to monitor your campaigns in real time, so you can swiftly adjust your approach. Typically, it would cost more and take longer to make these kinds of adjustments, but with Digital Marketing it\u2019s easier to course correct than it would be if you\u2019d invested in a print ad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat is Social Media?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESocial Media is an umbrella term to describe online platforms focused on community-based communication, such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Platforms like this use content sharing and post interaction, and most content is produced from the users, not the owners of the platform. Social media also includes curation sites such as Wikis, as well as professional networking platforms like LinkedIn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDue to the massive reach of Social Media, good social media marketing skills are now \u003Cem\u003Eessential \u003C/em\u003Efor anyone looking to attract the maximum number of customers online.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat is SEO?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESEO, or Search engine optimization, is the science of attracting specific types of traffic to a website, using a search engine. To master SEO, you need to create high-value content with high authority backlinks, and include keywords in that content that your ideal customers search for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESEO is never a one size fits all solution. To be successful, you must take a bespoke approach. That means you need to optimise your site for the type of search engine you want it to rank highly on, like Google, Amazon, or Bing. SEO typically focuses on scoring highly organic search results, not paid or sponsored traffic. You can also use it in paid ads, to maximise their reach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs search engines attempt to give the most suitable answer to each person\u2019s search query, you must ensure a search engine views your site as the most appropriate match.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEvery search engine uses a different algorithm to determine what the best result to a search query is. This will include a combination of different factors, including the quality of your content and backlinks, how many visitors your site has, and your website\u2019s speed and uptime.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModern SEO is complex, and mastering it takes more than just getting the right meta tags. It includes understanding how rich snippets, video, and featured snippets work to enhance your rankings, as well as the importance of voice search and Video SEO. If you want to be successful using Google Search, you also need to understand how Google Rank Brain scores your website and must optimise your site to score highly on Google\u2019s algorithm.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat is Local SEO?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELocal SEO is also becoming more critical, and you will need to learn the basics of this, especially since nearly half of all Google searches now have a local intent. Near Me searches have grown even faster, exploding at a rate of 150% more than local searches alone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMastering SEO includes understanding Technical SEO, which focuses on priming your website for crawling and indexing by search engines. It\u2019s important you don\u2019t neglect this aspect, as without it search engines will find it difficult to access, crawl, and index your website. As a result, you\u2019ll rank much lower. The reason this process is referred to as \u201CTechnical SEO\u201D is because it has nothing to do with promoting your website, and is not the same as the type of SEO you include in your content.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat types of careers will this course help you with?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you complete this course, you\u2019ll be a Digital Marketing Master, and will have many different career options open to you.

Just make sure to narrow down your choices and focus on what you enjoy and do well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe you have a passion for branding, and would like to work as a branding consultant for start-up companies? Perhaps you\u2019re interested in specialising, whether that be in marketing for the tech sector, the health and wellness niche, or in real estate?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best way to achieve top earnings is to find a niche you can position yourself as an authority voice in, and you can do this by acquiring a skillset your competitors don\u2019t have.

SEO knowledge is a highly in demand skill and it doesn\u2019t require a qualification. If you know how to do it right, copywriting can be similarly rewarding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause of the amount of online content we consume, demand for skilled SEO experts and pro copywriters has grown massively. More brands than ever require well-written content, that\u2019s optimised to perform well in search.

You can gain practical experience by creating sites for your family and friends for free, or in exchange for their skills.

Zero trust architectures simplify network infrastructure, make users happier, and keep cyberthreats at a distance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince John Kindervag, then at Forrester Research, coined the phrase, zero trust architectures follow the maxim \u0022never trust, always verify.\u0022 To block inappropriate access and lateral movement throughout an environment, zero trust architecture enforces access policies based on context\u2014including the user\u0027s role and location, the device they\u0027re using, and the data they\u0027re asking for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA zero trust architecture means you know who\u0027s using what, and you can track it, including encrypted traffic; you need to monitor and verify the traffic between parts of the environment; and you need multifactor authentication (MFA) that goes beyond passwords.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn important thing to remember is that in a zero trust architecture, a resource\u0027s location isn\u0027t as important as before. Rather than rigid network segmentation, software-defined microsegmentation protects your data, workflows, services, and such anywhere, in your data center or distributed hybrid or multicloud.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy using a network-centric data security strategy that provides specific access only to those who need it, Zero Trust Architecture focuses on the business needs and functionality of an organization. By enabling parameters to dictate access and restrictions, the Zero Trust model views data security from a whole new perspective. As opposed to legacy networks that have little to no visibility or control over network and data usage, Zero Trust Architectures see all network traffic through segmentation gateways with granular policies governing access to data, apps, and assets. There are certain rules that have to be followed before a resource can be accessed in a Zero Trust network.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe five major topics I want to cover in this master\u0027s course are\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.
