Between the training videos and the PDF books included in the course, it\u0027s invaluable -- and affordable for just about anyone. I took a media training course in NYC which required me to fly in for three entire weekends over the course of three consecutive months; TJ Walker covered essentially the same content right here. I\u0027ve worked in radio/television as a producer/host and I\u0027ve been interviewed by national media outlets from Good Morning America to the New York Times, so I\u0027m picky; and I\u0027m typically critical of those I see out there passing themselves off as media training experts, especially since I do media training (on a much smaller scale) myself. TJ Walker is the real deal. Though the production values aren\u0027t high end and the lighting/background could use some tweaking, the content itself is top-notch. Whether you have only two hours or up to two days before your interview, you\u0027ll have a significantly better chance of success by investing part of that time in taking this\u0022 \u003C/em\u003ELinda Lowen\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u0027\u0027I faced a lot of tvs, Radio, and Phone interviews in recent months.
