This course bridges the gap between economic theory and empirical analysis, offering a balanced blend of theoretical concepts and hands-on practical application. Throughout the course, students will delve into the core principles of econometrics, learning how to formulate and estimate econometric models, assess their validity, and draw meaningful conclusions. Topics covered include simple and multiple regression analysis, assumptions of classical linear regression models, hypothesis testing, and diagnostic tests for model validation. Students will gain a deep understanding of regression analysis, assumptions of Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), and how to derive OLS parameters and proofs of the Best Linear Unbiased Estimators (BLUE) properties. The course places a strong emphasis on understanding the underlying assumptions and limitations of econometric models, ensuring that students can identify and address common issues such as multicollinearity, heteroscedasticity, autocorrelation, and endogeneity. By the end of this course, students will not only have a solid theoretical foundation in econometrics but also practical skills to address complex economic questions and contribute to evidence-based decision-making in various fields such as economics, finance, and public policy.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/introduction-to-econometrics-theory-and-practice/","imageUri":"https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5487554_a21f_3.jpg","duration":"3.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"139.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["The course \u0022Introduction to Econometrics: Theory and Practice\u0022 is typically designed for students who have a basic understanding of economics and a strong interest in quantitative analysis.

It assumes that you\u0027re new to the language, so it gets you started with basic functionality such as creating functions, creating variables, and calling these lines of code from your standard HTML pages. It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables.

Two fundamental principles of Islamic banking are the sharing of profit and loss and the prohibition of the collection and payment of interest by lenders and investors. In Islamic banking, the banks do not collect interests from creditors. Instead, they earn money using equity participation systems and share profits and losses. Islamic finance is practiced in many Muslim countries and is extremely popular among Islamic communities, as some conventional banking practices might be against Shariah. Islamic finance is considered more ethical than conventional banking, as it believes that a bank and its clients should make profits and losses together. Hence, it does not just focus on maximizing the bank\u2019s wealth. Also, Islamic finance practices consider the best interests of the Muslim community.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIslamic banking development can be attributed to some conventional banking theories and practices which go against and hurt the sentiments of the Muslim communities. Hence, Islamic finance was developed by inventing methods that are Sharia-compliant. Sharia is the Islamic law present in the Quran\u2019s teachings. Creating practices that align with the Muslim culture and beliefs encourages many to take up banking. Islamic finance is so strictly followed that banks look to religious leaders and scholars for guidance. The main objective of Islamic banking\u003Cstrong\u003E \u003C/strong\u003Eand finance is that all society participants should create wealth and benefit. Usually, in conventional banking, some parties benefit at the expense of others.

In this class, we will dive into the world of Data Structures and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using the popular programming language, C\u002B\u002B.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EData structures are an essential part of computer science, as they provide an organized way of storing and manipulating data. By using data structures, we can access and modify data more efficiently, which is essential for developing efficient and effective software.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn our class, we will cover various data structures, including arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and trees. We will explore how to implement these structures in C\u002B\u002B and how to perform basic operations like insertion, deletion, and searching. Additionally, we will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each data structure and when to use them in different situations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELinked lists, for example, are a popular data structure used to store and manage data in a sequence. Linked lists are efficient because they can be dynamically allocated and are flexible in size. However, they can be more complicated to implement and use than other data structures like arrays.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStacks and queues are also important data structures that are commonly used in software development. Stacks use the \u0022last in, first out\u0022 (LIFO) principle, while queues use the \u0022first in, first out\u0022 (FIFO) principle. These data structures are useful for managing data in a specific order, and we will learn how to implement and use them in our class.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrees are another popular data structure that we will cover in our class. Trees are useful for organizing data in a hierarchical structure and are often used in computer science applications like file systems, databases, and search engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to data structures, we will also cover the basics of OOP in C\u002B\u002B. Object-oriented programming focuses on encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. With OOP, we can create reusable code, improve code organization and structure, and make code maintenance more manageable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn our class, we will cover the basics of OOP in C\u002B\u002B, including classes, objects, constructors, and destructors. We will also discuss inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation, and how they can be used to improve the functionality of our programs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EC\u002B\u002B is a powerful programming language known for its speed and efficiency. It is widely used in developing operating systems, embedded systems, and gaming applications. With C\u002B\u002B, we can take advantage of its powerful features to create complex programs with high performance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn our class, we will explore the C\u002B\u002B syntax and how it can be used to implement data structures and OOP concepts. We will also learn how to optimize our code for performance and efficiency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo wrap it up, our CS104, C105 Masterclass will provide you with a solid foundation in Data Structures and Object-Oriented Programming with C\u002B\u002B. You will learn how to implement data structures, use OOP concepts to improve your code, and take advantage of the powerful features of C\u002B\u002B.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/data-structures-cpp/","imageUri":"https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5160672_2d22.jpg","duration":"8.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"22,018.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["This course is ideal for individuals who want to enhance their programming skills with C\u002B\u002B and learn the fundamentals of data structures and OOP.","Aspiring computer science students who want to get a head start in their coursework or professionals who wish to expand their knowledge of programming will benefit from this course.","Students who have a basic understanding of C\u002B\u002B but want to learn advanced techniques and concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction should take this course.","Students who have a basic understanding of C\u002B\u002B but want to learn advanced techniques and concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction should take this course.","Programmers who want to learn how to design efficient algorithms and optimize code will find this course valuable.","This course is also suitable for individuals who are interested in pursuing a career in software development, particularly in industries such as gaming, mobile app development, and finance."],"tags":["Data Structures"],"rating":{"count":94,"averageValue":"4.2"},"instructors":[{"name":"OCSALY Academy | 250.000\u002B Students","url":"/user/online-academy-of-computer-science/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.207317}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"OCSALY_1000SUBS_YT","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-css-course/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":2039416,"title":"CSS3 Ultimate Guide","shortDescription":"CSS3 For Web Development: Quickly Master CSS3 By Building A Project From Scratch","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EHave you always wanted to learn how to code but don\u0027t know where to start?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould you like to make amazing websites and bring your ideas to life?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen CSS3 Ultimate Course is for you!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHi, I\u2019m your instructor Josh Werner and I\u2019ll be leading you through this course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProgramming is the most in-demand skill in 2021. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe course begins with the basics.\u0026nbsp; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll take you through everything you need to know to start building websites like an expert.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll learn all the fundamentals of CSS3 and how you can style your own websites. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is great for students starting or advanced developers that need a refresher course on CSS3.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are no requirements necessary to enroll I only ask that you come open minded and ready to learn\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFeel Free to look through the course description and checkout some of my preview videos\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe course is packed with over 6 hours of hands-on tutorials\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHere is what you will Learn:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E01.

During the beginning of the 20th century, most of these waters came under the category of global commons. Beginning in the 1950s, states began the process of appropriating for themselves these marine areas that were once part of the global commons. For example: in 1900 the territorial sea was only 3 nautical miles, now it is 12 nautical miles. Concepts like contiguous zone, continental shelf, and EEZ were not in existence and in fact, were not even thought about. With the advances in technology, humans\u2019 ability to exploit the high seas grew in an exponential way prompting nation-states to claim more and more exclusive rights for themselves. With more and more claims of exclusivity, there was an increase in the number of maritime disputes, particularly relating to the delimitation of the continental shelf and archipelagic waters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurthermore, with the increase in Global ship traffic, and overfishing, there is also a serious issue of marine environmental degradation. Hence, the United Nations took upon itself the task of consolidating the International Law of the Sea into a comprehensive UNCLOS convention that was concluded in 1983. The convention also provides for a permeant law of the sea tribunal to adjudicate conflicting claims and counterclaims, in fact, the treaty provides for compulsory adjudication of maritime disputes besides preserving the rights of individual nations to resort to an alternate settlement of these disputes by Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration. In many ways, the UNCLOS convention is a trendsetter. The process of determination of customary international law is one of the most complicated areas in International Law. Mercifully, the UNCLOS convention simplified the learning of international law of the sea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe convention provides for the establishment of an International seabed authority that would regulate the mining of high seas. The convention also makes a sincere effort to codify the rights of landlocked states and provides for elaborate provisions to regulate the exploitation of non-living and different types of living resources in marine waters. Considering that Global Warming and Climate Change are real threats to humanity, the convention also provides for guidelines to tackle marine pollution and determination of the extent of Archipelagic waters, the convention also provides succinct guidelines on issues like freedom of navigation, right of innocent passage that would include over-flight rights in the air space above international waters, legal regime on internal and international straits, human-made maritime channels, thus, trying to limit the increasing claims of state sovereignty over waters that were once part of global commons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe existing learning materials on the law of the sea focus mainly on the state practices of big maritime powers who had traditionally set the rules of the game. This course also focuses on the state practices of Asian and African states who became independent in pursuant to United Nations efforts during the second half of the 20th century. Unlike in the 19th and 20th centuries, western powers do not fight between themselves more often by resorting to war. During the birth of the United Nations, there were just 45 sovereign states. now we have about 195 sovereign states, and most of these new states are located in Asia and Africa. In fact, the Afro-Asian region had become a hotbed of serious international conflicts periodically manifested in violent armed conflicts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe international legal regime is described as a soft legal regime because unlike nation-states states International community lacks a centralized law-making body scheme for effective implementation and compulsory dispute settlement mechanism. The UNCLOS convention addresses each of these deficiencies in a focused way.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/international-law-of-the-sea/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5157364_20f5.jpg","duration":"5

No matter what you do to promote the product, it is called marketing. Marketing would continuously go on. And as a result, you would receive queries and leads for your products.
