In modern workplaces, boundaries are not always obvious \u2014 and the consequences of misunderstanding them can be serious.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA key strength of this course is that it approaches POSH and digital harassment \u003Cstrong\u003Efrom multiple, real-world perspectives\u003C/strong\u003E. You will explore situations through the lens of the \u003Cstrong\u003Eperson experiencing harm\u003C/strong\u003E, the \u003Cstrong\u003Ebystander who witnesses it\u003C/strong\u003E, the \u003Cstrong\u003Esupervisor or manager expected to respond\u003C/strong\u003E, and the \u003Cstrong\u003Eleadership or HR professional responsible for investigation, compliance, and culture\u003C/strong\u003E. This multi-perspective approach helps you see the full picture \u2014 not just what happens, but how decisions, silence, or action impact everyone involved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIn this course, you will:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDevelop\u003C/strong\u003E the ability to identify sexual harassment across physical, digital, remote, and AI-enabled work environments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDistinguish\u003C/strong\u003E between intent and impact, and recognise why \u201Cunwelcome\u201D conduct matters more than intention.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDetect\u003C/strong\u003E subtle, identity-based harassment, microaggressions, and power-driven behaviours before they escalate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EApply\u003C/strong\u003E appropriate responses from different roles \u2014 whether you are the person affected, a bystander, a manager, or part of HR or leadership.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENavigate\u003C/strong\u003E reporting and investigation processes with clarity, including roles, responsibilities, and compliance risks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EStrengthen\u003C/strong\u003E bystander intervention and shared accountability across teams.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBuild\u003C/strong\u003E a prevention-first mindset that supports healing, trust, and long-term cultural change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy does this topic matter so much? Because harassment \u2014 especially when ignored, minimised, or mishandled \u2014 erodes trust, harms mental well-being, and exposes organisations to serious legal and reputational risk. As work increasingly happens through messages, video calls, collaboration tools, and AI systems, the nature of harassment is changing. Understanding modern POSH is no longer optional; it is a shared workplace responsibility.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThroughout the course, you will engage with reflective exercises, real-world case scenarios, scenario-based quizzes, and guided role-play simulations that mirror what employees, managers, and HR teams actually face. These activities help you move from awareness to action \u2014 so you are prepared not just to recognise issues, but to respond thoughtfully and responsibly from your role.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat makes this course different is its balanced and respectful approach. It does not rely on fear, blame, or legal overload. Instead, it combines compliance awareness with empathy, clarity, and practical decision-making \u2014 making it suitable for global workplaces while remaining deeply relatable and human.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the end of this course, you won\u2019t just know the policy \u2014 you\u2019ll understand your role, your responsibility, and your power to make workplaces safer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEnroll now and take an active step toward seeing it, speaking up, preventing it, and understanding why it matters.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-posh/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/6986823_9c1d_3.jpg","duration":"2 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"385.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Employees who want to recognise, respond to, and report harassment safely in modern, digital, and remote workplaces.","People managers and supervisors who want to handle complaints responsibly, confidently, and in line with legal and organisational expectations.","HR professionals who want to strengthen investigation practices, documentation, and compliance while building trust with employees.","Organisational leaders who want to move beyond checkbox compliance and create genuinely respectful, safe workplace cultures.","Bystanders and team members who want to intervene appropriately and support colleagues without escalating risk.","Professionals working in hybrid or remote roles who want clarity on digital, online, and AI-related harassment boundaries."],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":5,"averageValue":"4.9"},"instructors":[{"name":"GenMan Solutions","url":"/user/monika-rawat-23/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.8}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"731B5FB243AF89EFA5B8","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-power-bi-expert-data-analysis-and-visualization/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":6143653,"title":"Advanced Power BI: Expert Data Analysis and Visualization","shortDescription":"From Data to Decisions with Advanced Modeling Techniques","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EThis Advanced Power BI course is meticulously designed to equip professionals with the expertise needed to master data analytics and visualization at an advanced level.
