The focus of the course will be on four key services, including: Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), AWS Storage Solutions, and Elastic Load Balancers (ELB) integrated with Auto Scaling Groups (ASG). \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAmazon EC2 is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It allows users to launch virtual machines (VMs) on demand and pay only for the compute resources they use. In this course, we will explore the different types of instances available, as well as how to launch, configure, and manage EC2 instances.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn addition to the EC2 service, we also explore AWS storage solutions including Elastic Block Store (EBS), Elastic File System (EFS), Snapshots, and Amazon Machine Images (AMIs). EBS is a block-level storage service for use with EC2 instances. It provides persistent storage for data that needs to be frequently accessed. EFS is a file-level storage service for use with EC2 instances. It allows users to create and configure file systems that can be accessed from multiple instances. Snapshots are point-in-time copies of EBS volumes that can be used for backup and recovery. AMIs are pre-configured virtual machine images that can be used to launch EC2 instances. In this course, we will explore the different storage options available and how to use them to manage data on the AWS platform.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOnce students have a handle on the foundations, we explore more intermediate topics relevant to workload distribution through the integration of ELBs and ASGs. Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs) are used to distribute incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances. They automatically scale to handle incoming traffic and can also be used to improve availability and fault tolerance. In this course, we will explore the different types of load balancers available, as well as how to configure and use them to distribute traffic across multiple instances.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWe will demonstrate how to integrate the ELBs with Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs) to ensure workloads are only distributed to healthy nodes within the EC2 service. ASGs allow users to automatically scale the number of EC2 instances in response to changing demand. They automatically launch and terminate instances based on predefined rules, ensuring that the number of instances is always sufficient to handle incoming traffic. In this course, we will explore how to configure and use ASGs to automatically scale the number of instances on the AWS platform.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThroughout the course, we will use hands-on exercises to help students gain practical experience with the AWS platform. Students will have the opportunity to launch and configure EC2 instances, create and manage storage volumes, configure load balancers and auto scaling groups, and work with other AWS services. By the end of the course, students will have a solid understanding of the AWS platform and will be able to use it to build scalable and reliable cloud-based applications.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-elastic-load-balancing-with-auto-scaling-groups/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4925158_0612.jpg","duration":"8 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"7,097.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Students interested in learning the foundations of AWS","Students interested in Cloud Computing","Students interested in exploring the Amazon EC2 Service","Students interested in exploring various EC2 Storage Solutions (EFS, EBS)","Students interested in setting up Highly Available cloud setups using ELBs, and ASGs on AWS"],"tags":["Cloud Computing","Amazon Elastic Block Store","AWS Elastic Load Balancing"],"rating":{"count":33,"averageValue":"4.4"},"instructors":[{"name":"YouAccel Training","url":"/user/youaccel/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.467742}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"YOUACCEL97668","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"2 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/online-effective-communication-skills/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":3736648,"title":"Online Authentic and Effective Communication","shortDescription":"Become an Effective Communicator And Find Your Authentic Self, Learn How to Succeed with Effective Communication Skills","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to effectively communicate online and offline with your co-workers, employees, boss, family and friends, then this is the course for you! \u003Cstrong\u003EOnline Authentic and Effective Communication \u003C/strong\u003Eintroduces you to the key techniques and information you need to effectively communicate. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow more than ever we need to build our foundation and find new tools to survive and succeed in the world we are living in.

In this course you will learn to harness the power of JavaScript, XML, AJAX, and React to build highly interactive web pages from scratch. We start with an introduction into the document object model, followed by an in-depth guide to the essentials of JavaScript. In the JavaScript section you will learn a number of concepts instrumental towards your journey as a developer. This includes working with variables, arithmetic operators, objects, functions, arrays, events, and loops. You will also learn the importance of JavaScript placement, while working with both internal and external JavaScript code components. Students learn the importance of operator precedence when performing simple and complex arithmetic operations. Furthermore, you will have the opportunity to work with conditional statements to perform comparisons between different operations. Once you have a handle on the foundations, we\u2019ll dive into a number of JavaScript development projects where you will have an opportunity to apply your new skills with practical hands-on exercises. This includes building an automated background color changer, and photo gallery complete with mouse overs and image transitions.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn the second section of the course we will explore XML and AJAX to demonstrate the power of asynchronous page updates. This means building web components that automatically update on a web page, without having to manually refresh. You will have an opportunity to work with both XML and AJAX in conjunction with JavaScript to build modern web app components such as a search suggest feature, and a pre-populated select menu.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOnce you have a foundational understanding of JavaScript and AJAX, we will dive into working with React, a powerful JavaScript library used for front-end UI development. The React section starts off with a hands-on project where you\u2019ll learn how to work with functional React components, props, Callback functions, OnClick Events, and the React State hook to build a fully functional calculator. From there we will dive into project number two, where you will build a connect-4 clone. Here we will cover more intermediate concepts including passing props, de-structuring, passing arguments to click events, various styling methods, and handling callbacks. You will also learn about the React key property, React lifecycle events, and conditional rendering. By the end you will have built a complete multi and single player connect-4 game board with built-in AI capabilities. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn the final section of the course we further unleash the power of React by building out a complete e-commerce site with multiple product categories, a product showcase, shopping cart feature, and much more. Here, we introduce a number of integral new concepts including: JSON server, Fetch API, and installing React router. These essential building blocks will be used to render the product categories, style the product list, and configure the product details page. From there we dive into styled components, refactoring the shop layout, and exploring the concept of \u201Ccontext\u201D in React. In the final stages of the project students will configure the shopping cart basket, and the checkout feature. We will also implement a product search feature, followed by in-depth exercises on validating input forms in React.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAs you can see this course covers a tremendous bit of ground.

Build an E-Commerce Site, Calculator, and Connect4 Game.","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the Complete React Certification course. This course offers a comprehensive guide into one of the most powerful, modern JavaScript libraries available - ReactJS. Whether you are completely new to React, or you\u2019ve dabbled with it in the past, one thing\u2019s for sure - You\u2019ve likely interacted with a number of web applications that use the React library for building out user interface components. Some of the most well known examples include Netflix, Facebook, and Airbnb. Developed and maintained by Meta along with a community of independent developers, React remains free and open-source. React is a component based library built entirely on JavaScript, which makes it perfect for designing complex UI\u2019s. With React, developers can build encapsulated components that efficiently manage their own state and render UI updates specifically when data changes. For example, think of the automated content refresh feature you see on a twitter feed, or Facebook like button. Here, the state of the UI component changes on the page without having to manually refresh when the data is updated. This is just one small, yet powerful UI feature built into React.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThis course starts with exploring the foundations of React and its core use cases. We offer a concise definition of what React is and what it\u2019s not. From there, we explore the tools needed to get started along with an introduction into JSX, and Functional React components. Through a complete hands-on project you will learn a number of important concepts including react props, callbacks, OnClick Events and passing parameters within callback functions. By the end of module one you will have built a fully functional calculator, complete with display and numerical operators. We will also cover important topics such as the React State Hook, and Debugging.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn the second module students build out a multiplayer Connect-4 clone, with AI integration. Here we start with styling the individual game board components followed by advanced onClickEvents. This includes global, dynamic and inline styling. From there, we move on to passing props, destructing, and React children. Students will explore the React key property, along with Lifecycle events, game initialization, CSS variables, and conditional rendering. By the end, you will have built a complete Connect-4 game capable of automatically determining the winner in both a multi-player and AI based single player setting.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn module three we further unleash the power of React by building out a complete e-commerce site with multiple product categories, a product showcase, shopping cart feature, and much more. Here, we introduce a number of integral new concepts including: JSON server, Fetch API, and installing React router. These essential building blocks will be used to render the product categories, style the product list, and configure the product details page. From there we dive into styled components, refactoring the shop layout, and exploring the concept of \u201Ccontext\u201D in React. In the final stages of the project students will configure the shopping cart basket, and the integrated checkout feature. We will also implement a product search feature, followed by in-depth exercises on validating input forms in React.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAs you can see this course covers a tremendous bit of ground. Best of all it\u2019s authored by Tim Maclachlan - a renowned senior full-stack developer with over 20 years of commercial development experience. As a multi-faceted developer, Tim\u2019s core competencies include algorithmic, analytical and mobile development.

Animation specialists know that \u003Cstrong\u003E2D\u003C/strong\u003E is a more simple technique - whatsoever, so it\u0027s a lot easier to learn and execute, but it still takes just as much, and even often more, time to do than \u003Cstrong\u003E3D\u003C/strong\u003E. On top of that, 3D is a lot more complicated than 2D.\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s for this reason that many producers are looking into 2D production as an animation technique. It\u0027s a technique that is not new though, but quite the contrary - it has been around since the \u002750s, actually much longer. However, it\u0027s been in the past couple of years that 3D animation has risen to the top. Just look at all the movies that were nominated this year for an Academy Award and you\u0027ll see that most, if not all of them, are 3D. If you think about all those movies, for example, \u0022Life of Pi\u0022, \u0022Hugo\u0022, and \u0022Hayao Miyazaki\u0027s\u0022 movies (\u0022The Wind Rises\u0022 and \u0022Ponyo\u0022), they were all done in 3D. This past year saw a large rise in 3D movies than 2D movies, especially when you compare it to the years before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 3D\u0026nbsp;animation process normally has three phases associated with it being - the following stages:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E1. Pre-production stage:\u003C/strong\u003E\u0026nbsp;This process includes concept creation, creating rough storyboards, making script reels, and character modelling. This is the most difficult stage of it all and also it involves a lot of brainstorming to be done by a huge team who will be working on the animation project.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E2. Production stage: \u003C/strong\u003EThis involves the creation of the animated film\u0027s animated elements brought together layer-by-layer and scene-by-scene, all into one place, ready for the final touches to be done or applied. This is usually termed as the \u0022Creation Stage\u0022 too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E3. Post-production stage:\u0026nbsp;\u003C/strong\u003EThis stage deals with rendering of the 3D animation and editing the video using any video editing software like Adobe Premiere Pro, iMovie for Mac or Final\u0026nbsp;Cut Pro (FCP).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe above phases also have multiple sub-processes within them.\u0026nbsp;Thus, this makes 3D animation a complicated process - \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Euntil now\u003C/em\u003E!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EForget being an animation specialist or learning 3D\u0026nbsp;animation from scratch.\u0026nbsp;\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EWhat if we told you that you could create amazing 3D animation videos at high speed using the world\u0027s most powerful and secretive software?\u0026nbsp;What if we told you that this is all possible without modelling, texturing, rigging, lighting or manual animation unlike leveraging traditional animation software to create a 3D output? \u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis means simply speeding up the three phases that we just talked about above by 99x.

However, MySQL and PHP are often swapped for alternative software solutions such as MariaDB, and Python. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe course starts with a detailed overview on setting up and configuring an instance remotely using terminal and terminal emulators such as PuTTY. Here, students learn the foundations of Linux and various Linux distributions such as Ubuntu to securely power web servers. Students will learn various Linux maintenance and directory commands, coupled with user account configuration and disabling root user access. From there, we dive into the foundations of database management systems and explore the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases. We also explore the two main database transaction standards, including ACID and CAP theorem. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOnce students have a solid understand on the foundations of cloud computing, we demonstrate how to securely install and configure LAMP Stack on Ubuntu. The installation will be complete with MariaDB and PHP, whereby students will learn to execute database commands directly from server-side PHP scripts.
