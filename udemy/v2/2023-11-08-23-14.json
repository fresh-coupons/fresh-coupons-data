If that were only possible!?!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reality is that things do not stay the same, things are always changing. This is true with personal development, parenting, relationships and everything in life. Granted change happens at different rates, some so slow barely detectable yet things change. In the world of personal development, parenting \u0026amp; relationship development coming to grips with change and managing the change aka change management can be daunting. Reason is, that so much of the change is beyond our control. Yet we do have control over some of the change and we certainly have control of how we respond to change and how we manage change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother truth is that time and change are related. We see change based upon time and we measure change by time and vise versa. The time element can create issues for us. If change doesn\u2019t happen in the time we believe it should we can get frustrated and quit doing our part to direct change to our liking. In parenting this happens all the time. We may try a new way of addressing our children and if they don\u2019t respond as the \u201Cbook\u201D says then \u201Cour child\u201D must be the \u201Cexception to rule\u201D. So we quit. It didn\u0027t work. Why? Because we often see change as two steps, Old way and New way. But in truth there are six main steps connected by bridges with each step having a cycle of steps. There are changes within ourselves and with our children that will operate at different rates. So when we see Old way expecting new way to happen along with our expectations of when the new way should replace old way, we can feel as if change isn\u2019t happening. \u003Cstrong\u003EHowever, if we understand the method of change and its framework we could actually recognize change happening and where we are during the process of change. This gives us a measure of where we are on the journey of change. This shows us the progression of change. And that we are making an impact even when it appears ( especially in the beginning ) we are not. The recognition of our control of change gives us the confidence and will power to continue on the journey of directed change.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHelp Me I\u0027m a parent! : Method Change, Peaceful Management is designed to show you change, what it looks like, how the process is broken down so that you can see where you are in the process of change, so you wont quit, so you\u2019ll achieve the change you are looking for, sooner rather than later or never.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m Coach Hall your instructor for Help Me I\u0027m a parent! : Method Change, Peaceful Management.

This course teaches students how to create modern, interactive web pages using the Bootstrap framework and React JavaScript library. The course starts with an introduction into Bootstrap with a focus on its reputation in the development community as the number one choice for mobile-first front-end web frameworks. Bootstrap is a well documented collection of reusable code written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We start with exploring the foundations of Bootstrap, including embedding it into projects, and building out the basic Bootstrap page structure. From there we catapult into the infamous Bootstrap grid system, along with the commonly used three column web page layout. After the introductory topics, students learn to work with a number of components from typography, tables and image styling right up to wells, alerts, and buttons. As part of the course we demonstrate how to build out intricate navigation menus using dropdown, collapse, accordion, and pill menus. We will also cover form styling, carousels, modals, scrollspy and just about every other Bootstrap component that\u2019s instrumental to your journey as a front-end developer. The module concludes with a hands-on project, where students will use a Bootstrap theme to build a stunning web page from scratch.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn the second section of the course, we explore React. React, also known as React JS, is a powerful JavaScript library used for building custom, interactive user interfaces using UI components. Similar to Bootstrap, React is a well documented free and open source library. The project was founded by Meta and a network of independent developers. In this section, students learn how to use the React library through a series of hands-on projects. The React section of this course starts off with a hands-on project where you\u2019ll learn how to work with functional React components, props, Callback functions, OnClick Events, and the React State hook to build a fully functional calculator. From there we will dive into project number two, where you will build a connect-4 clone. Here we will cover more intermediate concepts including passing props, destructuring, passing arguments to click events, various styling methods, and handling callbacks. You will also learn about the React key property, React lifecycle events, and conditional rendering. By the end you will have built a complete multi and single player connect-4 game board with built-in AI capabilities. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn the final section of the course we further unleash the power of React by building out a complete e-commerce site with multiple product categories, a product showcase, shopping cart feature, and much more. Here, we introduce a number of integral new concepts including: JSON server, Fetch API, and installing React router. These essential building blocks will be used to render the product categories, style the product list, and configure the product details page. From there we dive into styled components, refactoring the shop layout, and exploring the concept of \u201Ccontext\u201D in React. In the final stages of the project students will configure the shopping cart basket, and the checkout feature. We will also implement a product search feature, followed by in-depth exercises on validating input forms in React.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAs you can see this course covers a tremendous bit of ground. Best of all it features Tim Maclachlan - a renowned senior full-stack developer with over 20 years of commercial development experience.

React, also known as React JS, is a powerful JavaScript library used for building custom, interactive user interfaces using UI components. Some of the most well known examples of organizations using React for their front-end include Netflix, Facebook, and Airbnb. Developed and maintained by Meta along with a community of independent developers, React remains free and open-source. React is a component based library built entirely on JavaScript, which makes it perfect for designing complex UI\u2019s. With React, developers can build encapsulated components that efficiently manage their own state and render UI updates specifically when data changes. For example, think of the automated content refresh feature you see on a twitter feed, or facebook like button. Here the state of the UI component changes on the page, without having to manually refresh when the data is updated. This is just one small, yet powerful feature of React.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThrough a complete hands-on project, this course will teach you all the fundamental principles of React that you must know to become a proficient React developer. We start right from the basics, including the tools needed to get started. From there we dive into JSX, functional components, props, callbacks, and various OnClick events. By this stage, the calculator will have a complete visual display, coupled with functional arithmetic operations. Students then move on to passing parameters in Callback functions, using the React State Hook, and debugging.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn addition to the hands-on React module, we also offer a comprehensive overview of JavaScript for those who need a refresher. Here we start with introducing students to the document object model (DOM) which defines the logical structure of HTML documents. From there we dive into JavaScript to demonstrate various methods in which DOM elements can be manipulated to add interactivity to static components. We start right from the basics, which includes JavaScript placement, and data output. From there we move on to variable declaration, arithmetic operations, operator precedence, data types, and objects. Once the foundations are covered, we move on to more complex operations using Arrays, Conditional Statements, JavaScript comparison operators, booleans and loops. Here students will learn to unleash the true power of JavaScript to render different outcomes based on user interaction. We will explore the use of functions to efficiently handle repetitive tasks and JavaScript events to handle output based on actions and occurrences. The section will conclude with a hands-on project where students will implement their knowledge to build a web based photo gallery and background color changer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/build-a-custom-e-commerce-site-in-react-javascript-basics/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4789922_401f.jpg","duration":"7 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"39,618.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Students interested in learning the Foundations of JavaScript","Students interested in learning the Foundations of ReactJS Library","Students interested in Building Interactive UI Components using React","Students interested in learning how to build a fully customized E-Commerce Site in React"],"tags":["JavaScript","React JS"],"rating":{"count":157,"averageValue":"4.4"},"instructors":[{"name":"YouAccel Training","url":"/user/youaccel/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.325}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"YOUACCEL54835","originalPrice":"\u20B91,999","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/linear-programming-basics/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4478966,"title":"Linear Programming basics","shortDescription":"Number 1 linear programming course.

We will also go through some of the hardest-to-understand concepts like strong duality, complementary slackness, and Farkas\u0027 lemma. Furthermore, we try to understand these concepts in an easy-to-follow way. This allows one to obtain lower bounds on the minimization problem and provide proof of optimality or Infeasibility.

For example, if there is a rise in temperature it will also lead to a rise in the sales of ice creams. This is called positive correlation. Correlation analysis deals with relationship among variables. The correlation coefficient lets researchers to measure if there is a possible linear relationship between two variables measured on the same subject. The values of the correlation coefficient are always between -1 and \u002B1. There are different types of correlation coefficients used for different situation. The most common is the Pearson correlation coefficient. This chapter contains more details about the correlation theory and explains its types in detail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInterpretation of SAS Output\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe output produced by PROC CORR in SAS gives a lot of useful information. The output contains information regarding the list of variables included in the analysis. Next it provides a list of simple statistics for each variable in the analysis. This list contains the number of observations, mean, standard deviation, sum, minimum and maximum. One list contains each variable and their label. Finally the correlation measures are provided in the output. The output will be named \u201CPearson Correlation Coefficient\u201D by default. The results will be displayed in a cross tabular format with the values of one on the diagonal.

Traditional ways to succeed no longer work and you have to look beyond them to achieve greater success. Leading is an important trait that can be used in development of an organization. To initiate decisions that are translated in to concrete actions can be done only by true leaders who can fore see all kinds of situations. Managers must guide and motivate their people to achieve newer heights and become an asset to the company. A leader must direct, influence and motivate employees to perform essential tasks. At times of emergency, every manager must act as a leader to overcome business crisis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA good leader guides, instructs and motivates his fellow assistants and helps them work better. The skills, effectiveness and capacity of a great leader depend on how he manages his subordinates in times of crisis. He should work together along with other co workers to benefit the organization he is working in.Great leaders have the capacity to influence the subordinates in a positive way and get the work done in lesser time with the collective efforts of each employee. Leadership qualities are necessary in each individual, especially in people who are in managerial positions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EManagerial leadership can be seen in different dimensions in the modern day organizations.

Dictating is never encouraged while inspiring and empowering are still considered the best way to get work done from the employees.

It identifies who has power and accountability, and who makes decisions. It is, in essence, a toolkit that enables management and the board to deal more effectively with the challenges of running a company. Corporate governance ensures that businesses have appropriate decision-making processes and controls in place so that the interests of all stakeholders (shareholders, employees, suppliers, customers and the community) are balanced. Good corporate governance can benefit investors and other stakeholders, while bad governance can lead to scandal and ruin. Governance refers to the set of rules, controls, policies, and resolutions put in place to direct corporate behavior. A board of directors is pivotal in governance, while proxy advisors and shareholders are important stakeholders who can affect governance. Communicating a company\u0027s corporate governance is a key component of community and investor relations. For instance, Apple Inc.\u0027s investor relations site profiles its corporate leadership (the executive team and board of directors) and provides information on its committee charters and governance documents, such as bylaws, stock ownership guidelines, and articles of incorporation. Most successful companies strive to have exemplary corporate governance. For many shareholders, it is not enough for a company to be profitable; it also must demonstrate good corporate citizenship through environmental awareness, ethical behavior, and other sound corporate governance practices.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/corporate-governance-us-and-uk-markets/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5621750_ba49.jpg","duration":"2.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"1,096.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Bankers, Accountants, Stakeholders of a company, Anyone who wants to learn about corporate governance"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":0,"averageValue":"0.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"EDUCBA Bridging the Gap","url":"/user/premananda-suna/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":0}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"EDUCBABF22","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/networking-for-real-estate-investors/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":3076274,"title":"Networking for Real Estate Investors For Profits \u0026 Funds","shortDescription":"How To Prospect For Private Money","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EJay Conner shares how to Network for success as a real estate investor.

Learners will come away with an in-depth understanding of the world of forensic accounting and the many ways in which it may differ from the typical accountant\u2019s role. Forensic accounting is the investigation of fraud or financial manipulation by performing extremely detailed research and analysis of financial information. Forensic accountants are often hired to prepare for litigation related to insurance claims, insolvency, divorces, embezzlement, fraud, skimming, and any type of financial theft. Forensic accountants or auditors take a unique focus on performing their work. Typically, when a person with forensic experience is called in to examine financial records, it is due to suspicion of fraud, evaluation of assets, or even to track down fundamentally incorrect accounting.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/forensic-accounting-fraud-detection-and-investigation/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5615328_42e9.jpg","duration":"3 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"1,127.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Students, Professionals, Accountants, Tax professionals, Anyone who wants to understand forensic accounting"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":2,"averageValue":"5.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"EDUCBA Bridging the Gap","url":"/user/premananda-suna/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":5}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"EDUCBABF22","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/youtubeacademy/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":3714720,"title":"YouTube Academy: Complete Beginner to Pro Step-by-Step","shortDescription":"An In-depth Guide to Starting, Branding, Filming, Growing and Earning with YouTube","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EThis course covers everything you need to know from discovering what to make your channel about, planning, branding, filming, equipment; how to upload; how to use tags and titles, getting monetized and how to review your analytics inside YouTube. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe complete guide from A-Z for everything you need to know, all in one place for YouTube.

That is because accumulated stress can aggravate health challenges and other issues; for example, it may affect digestive health, inflammation, the immune system, bone density, sexual health, sleep, anxiety, etc. If you aren\u2019t careful, stress may amplify ailments that were under control before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EStress is normal but can be monitored.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u2019s normal to feel stressed sometimes, but if you always feel under pressure, it can have negative impacts on your mind and body.

Within the sharing of my life story are the teachings on how to heal your life. This particular course revolves around the deep seeded wounds and traumas, conscious and unconscious, that we hold in our cellular structure and our bodies. This course is an emotional journey though the heart. I will be adding more physically focused healing courses as well, however this is the one - the one that most people shun away from. I get it.

It turned out it was mostly about inner peace. That was the first time I\u0026nbsp;heard the term, \u0022inner peace.\u0022\u0026nbsp; I didn\u0027t know what that was and certainly didn\u0027t know how to obtain it. I was a wreck and my life was a mess. However, Gen Togden inspired me and I made a commitment to find inner peace no matter what. That was the start of my journey inwards. I\u0026nbsp;am happy to report that at this time in my life I have inner peace but it did take me quite a few years to change my life. Changing habits and lifestyle and patterns is a process. In this course I\u0026nbsp;will lead you through the steps I took and the changes I made that helped me to find inner peace. We will start with the tangible physical space, something that is more obtainable, then move inward toward the emotional and mental space. The most important take away from this entire course is that your perspective is what creates peace. If we want peace in the world we must have peace in our own hearts, minds and lives. The outer is a refection of the inner.
