The training program will help the trainee to perform all the statistical analysis with Minitab. It is also intended to make the trainees cover all the topics that fall under the domain of Minitab. Topics like Minitab GUI and Descriptive Statistics, Statistical Analysis using Minitab, Correlation Techniques in Minitab and Predictive Modeling using Excel will be covered in this training module and Project on Data Analytics using Minitab and Project on Minitab \u2013 Regression Modeling will be covered in the project module. The goal of this course is to help an individual to achieve knowledge of working with Minitab to perform time series analysis and forecasting of data in all sorts of statistics based problems. It will help all the interested trainees who are willing to extend their knowledge base concerned with Data analytics. This training will also assist the trainees to understand the sort of problems that could be resolved using this. After the finishing of the course, the trainee will advance with the skills needed for time series analysis and forecasting of data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo understand the meaning of the \u201Cname\u201D of the course, let us break down the curse and understand them word by word so that the intent of the course would be clear to our learners and we would set an expectation for our learners who would be pursuing the course. Let us start to understand what Minitab is. Minitab is a software used in use cases of statistics. Minitab, as the software is capable of data analysis, pattern detection through statistics, data crunching. Most of the calculation is automated, and graphs are generated as per the functionality required by the analyst working on the use cases. For this course specifically, we would be exploiting the use of Minitab for Time Series Analysis and Forecasting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, let us understand what time series analysis is. Time series data is a collection of data over some time or interval. The data when captured over time typically might have some internal structure, for example, autocorrelation, trends, seasonality, stationarity, and many such fundamentals. For example, let us think about the sales of umbrellas or raincoats. We can see that in the selling of these items we might encounter a seasonality aspect, that they might be sold high during the onset of the rainy season. Also, we can see that the data itself might auto-correlate itself to the promos that might have been set by some stores, online or offline, and many more such intricate detailing through the understanding of time series analysis fundamentals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow when we know how to analyze the time series it becomes pretty evident that what exactly to do with the studies or hypothesis we developed as a part of the study. The answer lies in prediction! We would understand the fundamentals through historical time series data and then utilize that deep insight to predict or forecast for the future. In this way, we would be able to capture the historical trends and seasonality and utilize them to have a better insight into what\u2019s in store in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis course is a collection of well-crafted tutorials or topics we would naturally go about if we must fully understand the topic of time series analysis and forecasting. This course will allow you to get a sense of what is lying in the basket of time series analysis in the professional project which you would encounter as soon as you take up the project in your organization. This course makes you reach that level of being the \u201Chandful\u201D of people who are capable of cracking even the toughest nut in the professional world.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis confidence you build in the course of this training will go a long way in not only analyzing the sense of time series data but also give you the capability to mentor people who would have just started their track on time series analysis. This course doesn\u2019t differentiate between a beginner or an advanced learner. We have to learn for everyone who is here to expand their horizon of knowledge. Lastly, we would like to mention that this course will lay a strong foundation in time series analysis so that you would be able to build a strong mansion on this foundation layer.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/predictive-modeling-and-time-series-analysis-with-minitab/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4722578_a844_3.jpg","duration":"2.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"7,982.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["We start everything from scratch and try to build from there and the only thing we require is a sense of perseverance and full dedication towards the course.

It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables.

I started out my sales career in car sales. I loved it except I was only there to gain sales experience and I had to always be there to make a sale. I treated my car sales job as my college years. I was there 3 years, 10 months before I discovered brokering money. I sell other people\u2019s money to small business owners. I sell the sexiest product in the world. The one thing that 90% of the world is chasing, I am selling. It\u2019s perfect and you can do it from anywhere in the world. This isn\u2019t a get rich quick scheme so if you are looking for one, you\u2019ve picked up the wrong course. You will have to work, but you can easily make 7-6 figures doing this. I am going to help you avoid some of my mistakes and get to where you want to be quicker. Like I said in the beginning, I was a car salesman. I got burned out and had a young daughter and I have always known that I just wanted to learn how to sell then do my own thing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHow do you Broker Money? \u003C/strong\u003EBasically, You are an Independent sales Organization or ISO for short. Your job is to find small business owners who need money for their business, the business can be a start-up, the business can be in different industries. I would advise you to pick a niche. (More on that later) Once you find people who are in need of money you then connect them to our friends (direct lenders) who have money for sale. You make money in the middle. Your don\u2019t have to put up any of your own money to fund businesses. There\u2019s limited risk to you. Our job is to simply find people who need money for business purposes. As long as you can help people solve their money problems, you will never have money problems of your own. You can make money as soon as the Day after you get started. In this industry we can get businesses funding within 24 hours and we get paid from the direct lenders after the business is funded. In this course, you will learn how to find deals, how to sell and have the opportunity to work with me directly. \u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/business-loan-broker-product-knowledge-sales-marketing/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5462204_f50f.jpg","duration":"2 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"3,358.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["This course is for people who are looking for a career change or an opportunity to work for themselves from home.","Real estate professionals and Mortgage lenders do well in our industry","This course is great for people who are in car sales and are trying to get into a new industry","This course is for business bankers that want to work for themselves and provide loans for businesses"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":14,"averageValue":"4.5"},"instructors":[{"name":"Amir Towns","url":"/user/amir-towns-2/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.5384617}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"FC23348360C0C429FDDB","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"\u20B9449","expirationText":"5 hours","discountPercentage":44}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/master-any-language-with-chatgpt-boost-your-language-skills/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5280736,"title":"Master Any Language with ChatGPT: Boost Your Language Skills","shortDescription":"Unlock Your Full Foreign Language Potential with Cutting-Edge ChatGPT Technology: Speaking, Writing, Listening, Grammar,","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EAre you looking to improve your English (or other foreign language) skills?
