After analysis, we understand what will help students to learn Java in a more efficient way. In this course:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E- High concentration of useful material in each lesson\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESometimes you can notice that watching 5 minutes of our lesson is equivalent to watching other 30 minutes lessons. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is because time spent for preparation for the lesson (script for the lesson, lesson structure) and video editing (to cut boring pieces of the lesson or time when the program loads) sometimes \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E10 times as much (sometimes even 20)\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E as the final lesson duration after video editing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly your homework and coding exercises including the EXAM\u0026nbsp;task might take approximately 20 hours to implement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, each topic is separated from another. In case some concept will be explained in the next lesson and you don\u0027t need to worry about understanding this in the scope of this lesson - the instructor will make an announcement when a specific topic will be covered. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGo and try it yourself!\u0026nbsp;We will appreciate your feedback.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E- Relevant knowledge\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter our team investigated other Java courses on Udemy we realized that most of them have nothing in common with real life. The information which is shared there is very old and significantly out of date. For example, the instructor teaches a framework which is not been used already for 15 years. Or instructors do stress on the programming design which is not used anymore at all!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe instructor of this course is a consultant in a top-rated IT\u0026nbsp;outsourcing company and helps to bring cutting-edge solutions in IT for all his clients. Feel free to check the LinkedIn page of the instructor and check skills endorsement. More than 18 thousand people across all over the world (BTW\u0026nbsp;most of them are from the top 100 companies of the world) evaluated the skills of Andrii Piatakha. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith this course, you can be sure that you will spend your time learning the right things from one of the best IT\u0026nbsp;consultants in the world. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E- Sequence of lessons\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter the years of teaching offline, and based on the feedback of students who are passing online courses we realized how important the sequence of lessons is while teaching Java. The same issue is with the books where information is completely unstructured what makes things even more complex. For example, how students can learn object-oriented programming from the first lesson if they don\u0027t know yet the java syntax basics?\u0026nbsp;Or how a student can implement a home task if he/she doesn\u0027t aware of java methods specifics, or doesn\u0027t know yet how to read program input?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in this course, you can be sure, that you will not get a home task to implement without having enough information to implement it. The program which is in this course is proven by many students who completed it offline and now work as software engineers in outsourcing companies and as freelancers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E- Interview practice tests\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/strong\u003EBeing an IT consultant in different companies, the tutor of this course was in charge of driving the interview process in companies to make sure, that company selects the best people. That\u0027s why the first interview is always test. In case the test is completed, the candidate is invited to have a conversation. That\u0027s why in this course we want to prepare you to complete tests successfully! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEspecially for our students, we prepared tests that could be used to evaluate their knowledge during the interview process. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 tests. 90 questions each \u003Cstrong\u003E(180 interview tests in total). \u003C/strong\u003E120 minutes each.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can read explanations for answers!

Also, you have a lot of tasks that use domain-specific terminology:\u0026nbsp;accounts, transactions, users, carts, menu, services, etc. So that means you are learning programming without abstract concepts like it is written in the books or in other courses. You learn domain-specific terminology and during the lessons, we investigate specific extracts from code that can give you a clear vision of how you can apply the knowledge in real life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo don\u0027t wait!

Course for beginners and intermediate users, and any who want to develop Business English skills and increase their level of knowledge.","Business English differs from common English in terms of vocabulary, tone, and communication style, as it is specifically tailored for professional settings and interactions within the business world.","Here are some key differences and reasons why learning Business English and Communications is important for companies and professionals:","Professional Vocabulary:  Business English incorporates specialized vocabulary related to industries, corporate functions, and specific job roles. This includes terms like ROI (Return on Investment), KPIs (Key Performance Indicators), and other jargon specific to various business sectors.  Formal Tone:  Business communication often requires a more formal tone compared to everyday conversations. Learning how to structure emails, reports, and presentations in a professional manner is crucial for effective communication within a corporate environment.  Cultural Sensitivity:  Business English teaches cultural nuances that are essential for global communication. Understanding how to navigate cross-cultural communication ensures that professionals can collaborate effectively with colleagues, clients, and partners from diverse backgrounds.","Effective Writing Skills:  Business English emphasizes clear and concise writing. Professionals need to be able to convey complex ideas in a straightforward manner, whether it\u0027s in emails, reports, or proposals. Clarity in communication helps in avoiding misunderstandings and ensures that the intended message is delivered accurately.  Negotiation and Persuasion:  Business English equips individuals with skills in negotiation and persuasion. This is crucial in scenarios such as contract discussions, sales pitches, or team collaborations, where the ability to articulate ideas and convince others is paramount.  Presentation Skills:  Professionals often need to present their ideas or reports to colleagues, clients, or superiors. Business English focuses on effective presentation skills, including organizing content, using appropriate visual aids, and engaging the audience.","Networking:  Building professional connections is a vital aspect of career growth. Business English provides the tools to engage in networking effectively, whether it\u0027s during conferences, meetings, or social events. This skill is crucial for establishing relationships that can contribute to career advancement.  Career Advancement:  Learning Business English and Communications can significantly contribute to career advancement. Professionals who can communicate effectively in a business context are more likely to be considered for leadership roles, promotions, and opportunities that require strong interpersonal and communication skills.  Global Business Environment:  In today\u0027s interconnected world, many businesses operate on a global scale. Proficiency in Business English is essential for professionals working with international clients, partners, or colleagues, enabling smoother collaboration and reducing the risk of miscommunication.","In conclusion, the mastery of Business English and Communications is integral for individuals looking to succeed in the professional arena.

Course for any who want to build the career at management, coaching, mentorship or get to know themselves better, for people working in helping areas, for coaches.","The Crucial Role of Coaching Techniques in Managerial Leadership and Career Development  The role of a manager goes far beyond traditional tasks of overseeing operations and ensuring productivity. A successful manager is now expected to act as a leader, a mentor, and a coach, guiding their team members towards individual and collective success. This paradigm shift highlights the significance of coaching techniques in the realm of managerial responsibilities.","The Transformation of Managerial Roles  Evolving Leadership Expectations  The traditional image of a manager as a stern authority figure has given way to a more holistic view of leadership. Managers are now expected to serve as role models, motivators, and mentors to their teams. This shift stems from the recognition that employees perform at their best when they feel valued, supported, and empowered.  The evolution of leadership expectations can be traced back to the changing dynamics of the modern workplace. In the past, managers were primarily responsible for enforcing rules and ensuring productivity. However, as organizations began to realize that employee engagement and satisfaction were crucial for success, a transformation in managerial roles ensued.  Today, managers are not just tasked with overseeing tasks and projects; they are expected to inspire and empower their teams. This shift is partly a response to the changing nature of work itself. In a knowledge-based economy, where creativity, innovation, and adaptability are paramount, traditional top-down management no longer suffices.","Coaching as a Leadership Skill  Coaching has emerged as a pivotal leadership skill that fosters personal and professional growth. We\u0027ll explore how coaching techniques, such as active listening, constructive feedback, and goal-setting, can empower managers to become effective leaders who inspire and guide their teams towards excellence.  Coaching is not a one-size-fits-all approach; it is a dynamic and personalized method of leadership. Effective coaches adapt their style to the needs and preferences of individual team members. They actively listen to understand the unique challenges and aspirations of each employee, fostering a sense of trust and rapport.  Moreover, coaching is not merely about providing solutions but guiding employees to discover answers themselves. This approach instills a sense of ownership and accountability in team members. It encourages them to take the initiative, think critically, and develop problem-solving skills\u2014a valuable asset in today\u0027s fast-paced, ever-changing business landscape.  Coaching also plays a crucial role in setting and achieving goals. Effective managers use coaching techniques to collaboratively define clear, actionable objectives with their team members. This process not only aligns individual efforts with organizational goals but also empowers employees to track their progress and make necessary adjustments along the way.","Coaching Knowledge for Career Development  Career Development in the Modern Workplace  Career development is a top priority for employees. Discover how coaching knowledge equips managers with the tools to help team members navigate their career paths, set meaningful goals, and continually improve their skills.  Career development has evolved from being a peripheral concern to a central focus in the modern workplace. In an era marked by rapid technological advancements and industry disruptions, employees recognize the importance of continuous learning and skill enhancement to remain relevant and competitive.  This heightened emphasis on career development places managers at the forefront of helping their team members chart their professional journeys. Coaching knowledge equips managers with the ability to provide guidance that is not only aligned with the organization\u0027s needs but also tailored to the aspirations of individual employees.  One of the key advantages of coaching in career development is its ability to facilitate self-awareness. Effective coaches help employees identify their strengths, weaknesses, interests, and values. Armed with this self-knowledge, employees can make informed career decisions that align with their passions and long-term goals.","The Manager as a Career Development Partner  Explore the responsibilities of middle and top managers in preparing and mentoring personal development plans for their team members. Learn how these plans can align with organizational objectives and create a win-win situation for both employees and the company.  Managers who actively engage in career development become indispensable partners in their employees\u0027 professional growth. They play a pivotal role in creating personalized development plans that leverage individual strengths and address areas needing improvement.  These development plans not only benefit the employees but also the organization. By aligning individual development goals with the company\u0027s strategic objectives, managers ensure that every team member\u0027s growth contributes to the overall success of the business.  Furthermore, coaching techniques are instrumental in fostering a growth mindset within teams. Managers can use coaching to encourage employees to embrace challenges, persist in the face of setbacks, and view failures as opportunities for learning and improvement. This mindset shift has a profound impact on team performance and innovation.","Coaching for Internal Education and Employee Development  The Role of Managers in Internal Education  Managers often bear the responsibility of nurturing a culture of learning within their teams and organizations. Explore how coaching methods can be instrumental in identifying and addressing skill gaps, fostering innovation, and supporting ongoing employee development.  Organizations that prioritize learning and development gain a competitive edge. Managers are at the forefront of this initiative, serving as the catalysts for continuous improvement and innovation within their teams.  Coaching methods play a pivotal role in identifying and addressing skill gaps. By regularly assessing the competencies of their team members, managers can tailor training and development programs to bridge these gaps effectively. This proactive approach not only enhances individual skills but also bolsters the organization\u0027s overall capabilities.  Moreover, coaching encourages a culture of innovation. Effective coaches inspire creativity and critical thinking in their teams. They challenge employees to question the status quo, explore new ideas, and experiment with novel approaches. In this way, managers act as innovation champions, driving progress and adaptability.","Coaching as a Tool for Employee Empowerment  Employee empowerment is a cornerstone of effective leadership. Coaching techniques provide managers with the tools to empower their team members by fostering a sense of ownership and autonomy in their roles.  One of the primary ways coaching empowers employees is by promoting self-directed learning. Instead of relying solely on formal training programs, employees learn to identify their development needs and take initiative in seeking resources and opportunities for growth. Managers who coach effectively encourage this proactive approach.  Furthermore, coaching cultivates a growth-oriented mindset among employees. When team members receive regular feedback, both positive and constructive, they become more receptive to continuous improvement. They view challenges as opportunities for growth and development, which ultimately leads to higher levels of engagement and performance.  By creating an environment where continuous learning is celebrated, managers inspire their teams to thrive in an ever-changing business landscape. This culture of learning becomes a strategic advantage for organizations, as it enables them to adapt quickly to new challenges and opportunities.","Coaching for Mental Health and Well-being  The Manager as a Trusted Support System  For many employees, especially those who live alone or lack a strong support network, a manager can become their most trusted confidant.

It assumes that you\u0027re new to the language, so it gets you started with basic functionality such as creating functions, creating variables, and calling these lines of code from your standard HTML pages. It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are practicals of:\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E* Javascript Course Contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Array\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Variables\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Functions\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Objects\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/css-and-javascript-crash-course/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4271184_7325_2.jpg","duration":"1 total hour","enrolledStudentsCount":"127,385.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["For CSS And Beginners","For People Who want to learn CSS Fundamentals and later Transition into Web Designing","For People New to CSS And Javascript"],"tags":["CSS","JavaScript"],"rating":{"count":2034,"averageValue":"4.4"},"instructors":[{"name":"PROPER DOT INSTITUTE","url":"/user/vivek-dahibhate-2/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.3732395}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"7160AF75F87F4BFE530B","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/python-101-complete-python-programming-step-by-step-guide/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":6709303,"title":"Python 101: Complete Python Programming Step by Step Guide","shortDescription":"Start your coding journey with Python 101 \u2014 build confidence and skills through simple, structured learning.","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAre you ready to dive into the exciting world of programming and unlock the power of Python?\u003C/strong\u003E Look no further!
