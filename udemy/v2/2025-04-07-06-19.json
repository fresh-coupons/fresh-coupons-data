Did you build a couple of projects with PHP and MySQL, but you still think you are inexperienced and you are missing out on a lot of things when coming to developing bigger projects? If yes, then this course is the right resource for you. This course is very digestible and informative and it was created specifically to enhance your coding skills and knowledge not just in PHP and MySQL, but overall in developing web projects. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is what we are going to do in this course. Naturally, we are going to get started by setting up the right tools for our projects. And after that, we are going to build our first simple yet very interesting project and that\u0027s a URL shortening service. The second project will be about sending emails in PHP and that\u0027s very important because it\u0027s a feature that almost every website has. The next project will be the starting of something big because it\u0027s an authentication system where I am going to teach you how to develop a login and a register page, how to hash and de-hash passwords, how to do validation and so much more. After this, we are going to build a comments system and this will be the biggest project in this course. We will begin first by doing a post system and then we will grab comments for every post that we have of course we will use Ajax-JQuery for inserting, deleting, and showing comments. after that, we will integrate a rating system into the previous two projects to make a bigger project. So, I will show how to download a JQuery plugin, how to integrate it and how to use it to do the rating system for every post, and so on. And the rating system is going to be implemented of course using Ajax-JQuery. The upcoming project is going to be also created with Ajax and JQuery and that\u0027s a live search system and we will combine it with our big project. The last project will be about building a weather app. All we are going to do is set up a form, allow the user to enter a city, and then give him the current degree of this city. So we will use an API to grab the current degree for this city. If that sounds like something that you are interested in, go ahead and get the course now. see you inside!! \u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/php-with-mysql-2023-build-7-php-and-mysql-projects/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5010434_6d6a_3.jpg","duration":"6 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"36,454.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Every PHP and MySQL developer who want to advance their skills","Developers who want to explore web development further","Developers who want to build cool projects and to build up their CVs"],"tags":["Bootstrap","MySQL","PHP","PDO"],"rating":{"count":164,"averageValue":"4.3"},"instructors":[{"name":"Web Coding","url":"/user/bdb27e95-65f5-415a-956b-65f62ba4bfc3/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.28}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"PHP7PROJECTS60","originalPrice":"\u20B91,799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/directorio-de-plugins-para-wordpress/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5356984,"title":"Directorio de Plugins para WordPress 2025","shortDescription":"Aprende a usar y configurar los mejores plugins para WordPress paso a paso.","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWordPress \u003C/strong\u003Ees un software gratuito o herramienta de gesti\u00F3n de contenidos, tambi\u00E9n llamado CMS (Content Management System), dise\u00F1ada para crear y mantener f\u00E1cilmente un Blog, un sitio Web o una Tienda Online.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWordPress es sin duda alguna, el mejor gestor de contenidos del mundo, y el m\u00E1s utilizado con diferencia, llegando actualmente a superar el 58% de cuota de mercado.\u003C/strong\u003E Adem\u00E1s es de c\u00F3digo abierto y completamente gratuito.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ELos plugins son parte fundamental del funcionamiento en WordPress, ya que nos permiten mejorar las funcionalidades que este famoso CMS trae por defecto.
