The focus of the course will be on four key services, including: Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), AWS Storage Solutions, and Elastic Load Balancers (ELB) integrated with Auto Scaling Groups (ASG). \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAmazon EC2 is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It allows users to launch virtual machines (VMs) on demand and pay only for the compute resources they use. In this course, we will explore the different types of instances available, as well as how to launch, configure, and manage EC2 instances.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn addition to the EC2 service, we also explore AWS storage solutions including Elastic Block Store (EBS), Elastic File System (EFS), Snapshots, and Amazon Machine Images (AMIs). EBS is a block-level storage service for use with EC2 instances. It provides persistent storage for data that needs to be frequently accessed. EFS is a file-level storage service for use with EC2 instances. It allows users to create and configure file systems that can be accessed from multiple instances. Snapshots are point-in-time copies of EBS volumes that can be used for backup and recovery. AMIs are pre-configured virtual machine images that can be used to launch EC2 instances. In this course, we will explore the different storage options available and how to use them to manage data on the AWS platform.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOnce students have a handle on the foundations, we explore more intermediate topics relevant to workload distribution through the integration of ELBs and ASGs. Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs) are used to distribute incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances. They automatically scale to handle incoming traffic and can also be used to improve availability and fault tolerance. In this course, we will explore the different types of load balancers available, as well as how to configure and use them to distribute traffic across multiple instances.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWe will demonstrate how to integrate the ELBs with Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs) to ensure workloads are only distributed to healthy nodes within the EC2 service. ASGs allow users to automatically scale the number of EC2 instances in response to changing demand. They automatically launch and terminate instances based on predefined rules, ensuring that the number of instances is always sufficient to handle incoming traffic. In this course, we will explore how to configure and use ASGs to automatically scale the number of instances on the AWS platform.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThroughout the course, we will use hands-on exercises to help students gain practical experience with the AWS platform. Students will have the opportunity to launch and configure EC2 instances, create and manage storage volumes, configure load balancers and auto scaling groups, and work with other AWS services. By the end of the course, students will have a solid understanding of the AWS platform and will be able to use it to build scalable and reliable cloud-based applications.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-elastic-load-balancing-with-auto-scaling-groups/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4925158_0612.jpg","duration":"8 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"17,399.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Students interested in learning the foundations of AWS","Students interested in Cloud Computing","Students interested in exploring the Amazon EC2 Service","Students interested in exploring various EC2 Storage Solutions (EFS, EBS)","Students interested in setting up Highly Available cloud setups using ELBs, and ASGs on AWS"],"tags":["Cloud Computing","Amazon Elastic Block Store","AWS Elastic Load Balancing"],"rating":{"count":66,"averageValue":"4.7"},"instructors":[{"name":"YouAccel Training","url":"/user/youaccel/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.590909}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"YOUACCEL22331","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"3 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/html-css-react-certification-course-for-beginners/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4789946,"title":"HTML, CSS, React - Certification Course for Beginners","shortDescription":"Creating interactive user-interface (UI) components using HTML, CSS, and React.","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the HTML, CSS, and React Certification course for beginners. In this course you will learn how to develop stylish, mobile responsive web pages right from scratch using some of the most powerful front-end mark-up languages and JavaScript libraries. The course starts with an in-depth overview of HTML where we start by exploring the structure of an HTML web page. Once you\u2019re comfortable with HTML foundations, we move on to demonstrating how to work with a number of HTML elements. This includes: Inline text elements, ordered and unordered lists, embedding media, link creation, tables, background images, form elements and iframes. The HTML segment concludes with a hands-on project that will guide you through creating a complete web page with headers, footers, callouts, images, links, forms and tabular data. By the end of the HTML segment, you\u2019ll be able to proficiently code simple and complex html pages with ease.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe second section of this course focuses exclusively on CSS to bring your web pages to life with custom style sheets. Here, students will learn the importance of responsive design and cross browser compatibility by embedding CSS style rules for individual page components. We start by exploring the parts, and types of CSS rules followed by an introduction into CSS Id\u2019s and divisions. From there we move on to CSS margins, text properties, borders, transparency and text on top of images. Once you have a handle on the foundations we move on to more intricate CSS concepts including CSS positioning, CSS float properties, Link Styling, and z-indexes. Similar to the HTML section, the CSS segment concludes with a comprehensive hands-on guide to building a responsive web page, complete with CSS style definitions, element containers, navigation, and a number of other CSS page elements.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOnce you have a foundational understanding of HTML and CSS, we will dive into working with React, a powerful JavaScript library used for front-end UI development. The React section starts off with a hands-on project where you\u2019ll learn how to work with functional React components, props, Callback functions, OnClick Events, and the React State hook to build a fully functional calculator. From there we will dive into project number two, where you will build a connect-4 clone. Here we will cover more intermediate concepts including passing props, destructuring, passing arguments to click events, various styling methods, and handling callbacks. You will also learn about the React key property, React lifecycle events, and conditional rendering. By the end you will have built a complete multi and single player connect-4 game board with built-in AI capabilities.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn the final section of the course we further unleash the power of React by building out a complete e-commerce site with multiple product categories, a product showcase, shopping cart feature, and much more. Here, we introduce a number of integral new concepts including: JSON server, Fetch API, and installing React router. These essential building blocks will be used to render the product categories, style the product list, and configure the product details page. From there we dive into styled components, refactoring the shop layout, and exploring the concept of \u201Ccontext\u201D in React. In the final stages of the project students will configure the shopping cart basket, and the checkout feature. We will also implement a product search feature, followed by in-depth exercises on validating input forms in React.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAs you can see this course covers a tremendous bit of ground.

Includes JSX, Callbacks, Events, \u002B More","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EThis course takes you step-by-step through the process of building a fully functional calculator in React. React, also known as React JS, is a powerful JavaScript library used for building custom, interactive user interfaces using UI components. Some of the most well known examples of organizations using React for their front-end include Netflix, Facebook, and Airbnb. Developed and maintained by Meta along with a community of independent developers, React remains free and open-source. React is a component based library built entirely on JavaScript, which makes it perfect for designing complex UI\u2019s. With React, developers can build encapsulated components that efficiently manage their own state and render UI updates specifically when data changes. For example, think of the automated content refresh feature you see on a twitter feed, or facebook like button. Here the state of the UI component changes on the page, without having to manually refresh when the data is updated. This is just one small, yet powerful feature of React.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThrough a complete hands-on project, this course will teach you all the fundamental principles of React that you must know to become a proficient React developer. We start right from the basics, including the tools needed to get started. From there we dive into JSX, functional components, props, callbacks, and various OnClick events. By this stage, the calculator will have a complete visual display, coupled with functional arithmetic operations. Students then move on to passing parameters in Callback functions, using the React State Hook, and debugging.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn addition to the hands-on React module, we also offer a comprehensive overview of JavaScript for those who need a refresher. Here we start with introducing students to the document object model (DOM) which defines the logical structure of HTML documents. From there we dive into JavaScript to demonstrate various methods in which DOM elements can be manipulated to add interactivity to static components. We start right from the basics, which includes JavaScript placement, and data output. From there we move on to variable declaration, arithmetic operations, operator precedence, data types, and objects. Once the foundations are covered, we move on to more complex operations using Arrays, Conditional Statements, JavaScript comparison operators, booleans and loops. Here students will learn to unleash the true power of JavaScript to render different outcomes based on user interaction. We will explore the use of functions to efficiently handle repetitive tasks and JavaScript events to handle output based on actions and occurrences. The section will conclude with a hands-on project where students will implement their knowledge to build a web based photo gallery and background color changer. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAs you can see this course covers a tremendous bit of ground.

Please kindly listen and follow according,\u0026nbsp; as it is designed to steadily and incrementally break down your internal resistance on money in the most effective way possible. Your resistance is very powerful and has been built up and refined over decades. So do not rush to the other courses Part 2, 3, 4, \u0026amp; 5 in the Module. You\u0026nbsp; will simply not get the benefit of the entire 5-Part course Module.\u0026nbsp; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is important to follow the sequence so that you\u0026nbsp; can put yourself on the path to success and wealth creation as quickly and efficiently as possible.
