The CRISPR-Cas9 system consists of two key molecules that introduce a change (mutation) into the DNA. These are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u2981\tan enzyme called Cas9. This acts as a pair of \u2018molecular scissors\u2019 that can cut the two strands of DNA at a specific location in the genome so that bits of DNA can then be added or removed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u2981\ta piece of RNA called guide RNA (gRNA). This consists of a small piece of pre-designed RNA sequence located within a longer RNA scaffold. The scaffold part binds to DNA and the pre-designed sequence \u2018guides\u2019 Cas9 to the right part of the genome. This makes sure that the Cas9 enzyme cuts at the right point in the genome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The guide RNA is designed to find and bind to a specific sequence in the DNA. The guide RNA has RNA bases that are complementary to those of the target DNA sequence in the genome. This means that, at least in theory, the guide RNA will only bind to the target sequence and no other regions of the genome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. The Cas9 follows the guide RNA to the same location in the DNA sequence and makes a cut across both strands of the DNA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. At this stage the cell recognizes that the DNA is damaged and tries to repair it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5.

Clinical research involves collecting and analyzing data from people, either through physical examinations, laboratory tests, or surveys. Clinical trials are experiments conducted to test the safety and efficacy of a medical intervention or treatment. The scope of clinical research and clinical trials includes a wide range of activities, such as designing the study protocol, recruiting participants, conducting the trial, collecting and analyzing data, and reporting the results. Clinical research professionals are responsible for ensuring the study is conducted in compliance with ethical guidelines, local and international laws, and good clinical practices. Clinical research and clinical trials play an important role in advancing medical knowledge and improving public health. By conducting research and trials, scientists can develop new treatments, as well as test existing treatments to find out if they are effective or safe. Clinical research and trials are also used to identify risk factors for diseases, develop better diagnostic methods, and determine the impact of lifestyle choices on health.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESalary Range\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe salary range for Clinical Research and Clinical Trail Administrators varies depending on the type of research and the location of the position.

This may involve changing a single base pair (A-T or C-G), deleting a region of DNA or adding a new segment of DNA. For example, genetic engineering may involve adding a gene from one species to an organism from a different species to produce a desired trait. Used in research and industry, genetic engineering has been applied to the production of cancer therapies, brewing yeasts, genetically modified plants and livestock, and more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGenetic engineering, also called genetic modification or genetic manipulation, is the modification and manipulation of an organism\u0027s genes using technology. It is a set of technologies used to change the genetic makeup of cells, including the transfer of genes within and across species boundaries to produce improved or novel organisms. New DNA is obtained by either isolating or copying the genetic material of interest using recombinant DNA methods or by artificially synthesizing the DNA. A construct is usually created and used to insert this DNA into the host organism. The first recombinant DNA molecule was made by Paul Berg in 1972 by combining DNA from the monkey virus SV40 with the lambda virus. As well as inserting genes, the process can be used to remove, or \u0022knock out\u0022, genes. The new DNA can be inserted randomly, or targeted to a specific part of the genome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIMPORTANCE OF DNA MANIPULATION TECHNIQUES\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGenetic modification allows changes in genes to transfer genetic material in different organisms. It is possible to introduce foreign genes into crop plants and express these in specific tissues. Transfer of genes can help to improve crop protection. Genetic modification can be done with various viral and non viral methods. Direct manipulation of DNA sequences can lead to different expression levels. Choosing the best method for gene delivery can be a difficult task, particularly to transfer genetic material in a proper way. This review highlights, basic mechanism and importance and different methods used for efficient gene delivery. Hence, understanding of intracellular machinery plays a crucial role for designing a more effective gene delivery environment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJob Scope\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJobs directly related to your degree include:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00B7 Academic researcher\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00B7 Biomedical scientist\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00B7 Clinical research associate\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00B7 Clinical scientist, genomics\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00B7 Clinical scientist, immunology\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00B7 Genetic counselor\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00B7 Plant breeder/geneticist\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00B7 Research scientist (life sciences)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00B7 Research scientist (medical)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJobs where your degree would be useful include:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00B7 Biotechnologist\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00B7 Data scientist\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00B7 Epidemiologist\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00B7 Forensic scientist\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00B7 Medical science liaison\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00B7 Physician associate\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00B7 Scientific laboratory technician\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00B7 Science writer\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00B7 Secondary school teacher\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESalary Range Provided in Genetic Engineering field:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECandidate in jobs or training period ranges from 2-2.8 Lakh per annum\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor research associate, it ranges from 3.5 lakh to 5 lakh per year.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJunior scientists vary from 6-9 lakh per annum\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhereas for a senior scientist, it varies between 15-16 lakh per annum in private companies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot only in India but in foreign also if you are looking for a career the average annual base salary is $159,339 to $194,895 of geneticists in the USA.
