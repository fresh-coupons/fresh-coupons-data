Wondering how? I will tell you how\u2026 but before that let me remind you how often you negotiate in life. From childhood, you must have practiced the art of negotiation \u2013 Bedtime, a treat, a promotion, a raise, an extended deadline. Yet you are not good at negotiations. Why? Does it demand a different level of intellect and expertise? Well, I will say \u201CNo\u201D to the former and \u201CYes\u201D to the latter. There are some techniques and a process when put into practice enable you to save thousands of dollars, but unfortunately, no one has told you these techniques yet, and hence, you are missing out. And by this time, I am sure you must have figured out what I am doing here. I am here to help you and uncover all these techniques in this course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt may be\u2026or may not be difficult for you to digest the fact that we all negotiate on a daily basis. On a personal level, we negotiate with friends, family, landlords, car sellers, and employers, among others. We come across hundreds of situations that put our negotiation skills to the test. Whether buying a house or car, reviewing your salary with your boss, or deliberating contracts for your business, your success in each of\u003Cstrong\u003E \u003C/strong\u003Ethese activities will be heavily dependent on your ability to negotiate. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut how come I am speaking so highly of negotiation skills? Well, I\u0027ve spent thousands of hours reading books, articles, and videos and doing real-life research aiming to master negotiation conversations. And now, I want my learnings to benefit you so that you don\u2019t need to chart the long road which I have trodden on.

Combining the principles of Evolution and Brain Science, this program demystifies the science of negotiation like nothing else. This course will help you prepare for and conduct real-world negotiations, from personal to professional, small to large, daily to extraordinary. You won\u2019t be able to find anything else even one-hundredth as valuable and jaw-dropping. If you get it, please feel free to revert to me.

From laptops to datacentres, game consoles to scientific supercomputers, cell phones to the Internet, Java is everywhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJava applications generally contain many mini programs with various functions. Some mini programs have a graphical user interface (GUI), if only a simple window or dialog box, and many mini programs have no GUI. The application itself, however, is likely to have a main GUI that consists of menus, buttons, tool bars, text fields, and other graphical features. The GUI is mainly for user input, whether the user clicks a button or types in information, and a GUI can provide the user with additional information. In addition, GUI components often display information back to the user.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo create the GUI, you use the Java Foundation Classes/Swing (JFC/Swing) and Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) API. The many classes and interfaces in those packages allow you to easily create buttons, check-box objects, text fields, and other components, as well as components to organize them. By far the easiest way to create the frame and all the GUI components for your application is to use an integrated development environment (IDE),\u0026nbsp; such as the NetBeans IDE.

Excel analysis is ubiquitous around the world and used by businesses of all sizes to perform financial analysis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe use of Excel is widespread in the industry. It is a very powerful data analysis tool and almost all big and small businesses use Excel in their day to day functioning. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The course is designed keeping in mind two kinds of learners - those who have very little functional knowledge of Excel and those who use Excel regularly but at a peripheral level and wish to enhance their skills. The course takes you from basic operations such as reading data into excel using various data formats, organizing and manipulating data, to some of the more advanced functionality of Excel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a data analyst, you are on a journey. Think about all the data that is being generated each day and that is available in an organization, from transactional data in a traditional database, telemetry data from services that you use, to signals that you get from different areas like social media.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, today\u0027s retail businesses collect and store massive amounts of data that track the items you browsed and purchased, the pages you\u0027ve visited on their site, the aisles you purchase products from, your spending habits, and much more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith data and information as the most strategic asset of a business, the underlying challenge that organizations have today is understanding and using their data to positively effect change within the business. Businesses continue to struggle to use their data in a meaningful and productive way, which impacts their ability to act.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe key to unlocking this data is being able to tell a story with it. In today\u0027s highly competitive and fast-paced business world, crafting reports that tell that story is what helps business leaders take action on the data. Business decision makers depend on an accurate story to drive better business decisions. The faster a business can make precise decisions, the more competitive they will be and the better advantage they will have. Without the story, it is difficult to understand what the data is trying to tell you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, having data alone is not enough. You need to be able to act on the data to effect change within the business. That action could involve reallocating resources within the business to accommodate a need, or it could be identifying a failing campaign and knowing when to change course. These situations are where telling a story with your data is important.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"Ingl\u00E9s","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/data-analysis-using-excel-power-pivot-pivot-tables-dax/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4132170_8933.jpg","duration":"2 horas","enrolledStudentsCount":"1.235 estudiantes","lastUpdated":"Fecha de la \u00FAltima actualizaci\u00F3n: 6/2021","targetAudiences":["Beginner Data Analyst","Beginners to Data Science"],"tags":["Productividad en la oficina","Microsoft","An\u00E1lisis de datos"],"rating":{"count":7,"averageValue":"4.3"},"instructors":[{"name":"Bluelime Learning Solutions","url":"/user/javascript-academy/","totalNumberOfStudents":701217,"totalNumberOfReviews":29865,"averageRating":4.142014900129569}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"87E78EE646F70A0AD57D","originalPrice":"1.280\u00A0\u20B9","discountedPrice":"832\u00A0\u20B9","expirationText":"5 Stunden","discountPercentage":35}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/start-coding-learn-html-css-and-javascript/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":1280884,"title":"Learn to code - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript","shortDescription":"Build a  one page website |Todolist App | Calculator |Quiz app","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003ELearning to code can be both fun and rewarding.
