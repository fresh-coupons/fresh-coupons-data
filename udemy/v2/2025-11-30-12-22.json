It assumes that you\u0027re new to the language, so it gets you started with basic functionality such as creating functions, creating variables, and calling these lines of code from your standard HTML pages. It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E*\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E javascript course contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript introduction\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript array\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript variables\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript functions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript objects\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript control statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript cookies\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript loop statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript data structures\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript error handling\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript regular expressions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003Esection 4- learn PHP\u0026nbsp;programming language\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis section will learn the basic structure of a web application and how a web browser interacts with a web server.

A course for anyone who wants to build career in management","What are Mergers and Acquisitions (M\u0026A)?  Merger: Two companies of relatively similar size combine forces to create a new, single entity. This is often a move for market expansion or gaining a competitive edge.  Acquisition: One company purchases a majority stake or all of another company. The acquiring company gains control of the acquired company\u0027s assets and operations. This can be done to enter new markets, eliminate competition, or gain new technology resources.","Key Pitfalls in M\u0026A  Culture Clash: Combining distinct company cultures can lead to employee conflicts, low morale, and a decline in productivity.  Overpaying: Enthusiasm can lead companies to overpay for an acquisition, resulting in financial losses down the line.  Poor Integration: Failure to smoothly integrate systems, processes, and teams creates operational chaos and hinders the potential of the combined entity.  Lack of Due Diligence: Insufficient research about the target company\u0027s financial health, legal standing, or market position might expose hidden liabilities and risks.  Loss of Focus: The complexity of the M\u0026A process can distract from core business operations, leading to neglected customers or missed opportunities.","Why is Learning About M\u0026A Important for Companies and Managers?  Strategic Growth: M\u0026A can be a powerful tool to expand into new markets, acquire new technologies, eliminate competitors, or increase market share significantly.

Leadership Development: M\u0026A success relies heavily on the ability of managers to navigate complexity, integrate teams, and make crucial decisions under pressure.","How Can M\u0026A Skills Support Career Development?  Increased Demand: As M\u0026A activity continues to be prevalent, professionals with these skills are highly sought after by companies, investment banks, and consulting firms.

Managers can offer insights into effective communication, conflict resolution, and building positive relationships, which can significantly impact an employee\u0027s overall quality of life.  In times of personal crisis or uncertainty, such as major life transitions or unexpected challenges, employees may turn to their managers for guidance. Managers trained in coaching can provide a supportive and non-judgmental space for employees to explore their feelings, identify potential solutions, and develop action plans to address these challenges.","Coaching techniques have become indispensable in the modern workplace, particularly within the roles of managers and leaders. These skills not only drive career development and internal education but also play a crucial role in supporting the mental health and well-being of employees.  As we navigate an ever-changing professional landscape, organizations that recognize the importance of coaching will not only foster a culture of continuous improvement but also cultivate a loyal and motivated workforce. Managers who embrace coaching as a core aspect of their leadership style will not only elevate their own careers but also become catalysts for the success of their teams and organizations as a whole.  By understanding and implementing coaching techniques effectively, managers can truly transform the workplace into an environment where individuals thrive, careers flourish, and holistic well-being is nurtured."],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":133,"averageValue":"4.3"},"instructors":[{"name":"MTF Institute of Management, Technology and Finance","url":"/user/mtfinstitute/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.5}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"E8A1920BA962DD9ABEA3","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"2 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/executive-certificate-in-business-leadership/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5949140,"title":"Executive Certificate in Business Leadership","shortDescription":"Executive Certificate in Business Leadership by MTF Institute","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWelcome to course:\u003C/strong\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003EExecutive Certificate in Business Leadership by MTF Institute\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECourse provided by \u003Cstrong\u003EMTF Institute of Management, Technology and Finance\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMTF\u003C/strong\u003E is the global educational and research institute with HQ at Lisbon, Portugal, focused on business \u0026amp; professional hybrid (on-campus and online) education at areas: Business \u0026amp; Administration, Science \u0026amp; Technology, Banking \u0026amp; Finance. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMTF R\u0026amp;D \u003C/strong\u003Ecenter focused on research activities at areas: Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Data Science, Big Data, WEB3, Blockchain, Cryptocurrency \u0026amp; Digital Assets, Metaverses, Digital Transformation, Fintech, Electronic Commerce, Internet of Things. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMTF\u003C/strong\u003E is the official partner of: IBM, Intel, Microsoft, member of the Portuguese Chamber of Commerce and Industry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMTF \u003C/strong\u003Eis present in 208 countries and has been chosen by more than 440 000 students.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBusiness leadership is the art of guiding an organization towards success.
