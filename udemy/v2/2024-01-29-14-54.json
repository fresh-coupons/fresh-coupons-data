By addressing stigma, we can create an environment where individuals feel comfortable seeking help, receiving appropriate care, and living fulfilling lives. Mental health stigma refers to the negative attitudes, beliefs, and stereotypes that surround mental health and mental illness. It involves prejudiced judgments, discrimination, and the marginalization of individuals with mental health conditions. Stigma can manifest at various levels, including societal, interpersonal, and self-stigma. Addressing mental health stigma involves promoting awareness, education, and challenging misconceptions. Efforts to reduce stigma aim to create a more supportive and understanding environment for individuals with mental health conditions, fostering a society where mental health is treated with the same importance and empathy as physical health. The objective of this course is to understand and explore the concept and types of mental health stigma, examine how mental health stigma affects individuals and society and develop strategies to combat mental health stigma. This course aims to help educators, students, research scholars, mental health practitioners and counselors to understand and apply strategies for combating mental health stigma and promoting mental health resilience.

From constructing detailed Excel worksheets that mirror the guitar fretboard, to mapping out chords and scales, this course ensures a comprehensive and hands-on learning experience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first section of the course is dedicated to building a robust Excel worksheet that will serve as your guide and companion throughout your musical journey. Whether you\u0027re keen on enhancing your Excel skills or solely focused on the music theory aspect, this course caters to you. We provide step-by-step guidance for constructing the worksheet, ensuring you grasp the fundamentals of both Excel and music theory. For those more inclined towards the theory, a completed copy of the worksheet is provided at each stage, allowing you to dive straight into the musical exploration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn a unique twist, the worksheet is formatted with the lowest guitar string at the top, mirroring the way most guitarists visually perceive the fretboard while playing. This intuitive layout ensures a seamless transition from theory to practice, enhancing your ability to visualize and navigate the fretboard with ease.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs the course progresses, we delve into the key of C in open position, unraveling its mysteries with unparalleled detail. You will learn to construct and analyze each chord within this key, mapping them onto the fretboard, fingering the positions, and understanding their relationship with the C Major scale. By contrasting the C Major Scale with the scale of each chord, you gain a holistic understanding of musical relationships and patterns, enriching your theoretical knowledge and practical skills simultaneously.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is more than just a course; it\u0027s an innovative journey that blends the power of Excel with the beauty of guitar music theory, ensuring you emerge with a solid foundation and a new-found appreciation for the fretboard.

Epithelium, connective tissue, muscle tissue, and nervous tissue have commonalities but look very distinct structurally after staining. Each stain exists to highlight an important feature or component within a tissue type. For example, one of the most common stains, Hematoxylin, is a basic dye that stains proteins a blue color, while Eosin stains proteins a pink color. These two stains are commonly used together to define intracellular organelles and proteins. Because of the variety of the proteins that exist, some stains were created to highlight a particular protein, which this review will discuss in the following sections. The benefit of using a special stain is that it can highlight the specific protein very well. However, because of its specificity, the other structures will not be seen. For this reason, multiple slides will often be created from a given specimen so that multiple stains can be performed to gather the full range of needed information.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlmost all tissue stains are performed on tissue that has been removed from the body. However, in rare instances, very specialize stains called vital stains can work on tissue remaining in the body. These stains are used for the identification of specific types of tissue and identification of abnormal tissue, so a subsequent biopsy can be more accurate in obtaining abnormal tissue\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETissue Preparation\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore specific staining can occur, tissue samples must undergo preparation through the following stages: Fixation, processing, embedding, sectioning, and sometimes antigen retrieval. In modern histology laboratories, most of these steps are automated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E.\u003Cstrong\u003EFixation: \u003C/strong\u003EFixation uses chemicals to preserve the structure of the tissue in its natural form and protects it from degradation by irreversibly cross-linking proteins. Although several specialized fixatives are available, Neutral Buffered Formalin is a common choice for this step. The fixation step is vital to the rest of the histologic staining procedure because by retaining the chemical composition of the tissue, the sample is hardened and makes the sectioning phase easier. Paraffin-formalin is another effective fixative. Its benefit is that it is the fixative of choice for immunostaining; however, it requires preparation at the time of the fixation. Bouin is a fixative used for examining embryo and brain tissue because of its superior preservation of delicate nuclei and glycogen. Its downside is that it does not preserve kidney tissues well and also distorts mitochondrial structure.[1]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDehydration: \u003C/strong\u003EThe addition of ethanol accomplishes the dehydration of a sample. It removed water from the sample and further hardens the tissue for eventual light microscopy. After ethanol is applied, and following the completion of tissue dehydration, xylene is used to remove the ethanol.[1]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEmbedding: \u003C/strong\u003EEmbedding is the process of putting the sample into a paraffin wax or a plastic resin to enhance the process of extracting cellular structures. This step is to be performed with caution if the goal is to perform immunostaining because the paraffin wax will inhibit the penetration of antibodies, and lead to a false result.[1]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESectioning: \u003C/strong\u003ESectioning involves mounting the specimen on a microtome and cutting it into sections.

These players can be divided roughly into two groups: those that are members of the innate immune system team and those that are part of the adaptive immune system. Importantly, these two groups work together to provide a powerful defense against invaders. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImmunology is a difficult subject for several reasons. First, there are lots of details, and sometimes these details get in \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe way of understanding the concepts. To get around this problem, we\u2019re going to concentrate on the big picture. It \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewill be easy for you to find the details somewhere else. Another difficulty in learning immunology is that there \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eis an exception to every rule. Immunologists love these exceptions, because they give clues as to how the immune \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esystem functions. But for now, we\u2019re just going to learn the rules. Oh sure, we\u2019ll come upon exceptions from time \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eto time, but we won\u2019t dwell on them. Our goal is to exam-ine the immune system, stripped to its essence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA third difficulty in studying immunology is that our knowledge of the immune system is still evolving. As \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyou\u2019ll see, there are many unanswered questions, and some of the things that seem true today will be proven \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efalse tomorrow. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe term \u201Cimmunology\u003C/strong\u003E\u201D is derived from Latin word \u201Cimmunis\u201D means exempt, i.e., protection from infectious diseases. Extensive work on bacteriology and pathology made their respective workers to find methods to develop resistance against infectious diseases in the latter half of 19th and beginning of 20th century. Although the history of immunology is about 100 years old, cellular immunology dates back to the 1950s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ewhy is immunology so important?\u003C/strong\u003E The immune system has involvement in almost all fields related to health and disease. Infections continue to confront human health and well-being on a global scale. Inflammation contributes to the \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Elung, heart and joint diseases, and diabetes mellitus; cancers have to evade immune surveillance, and immune dysregulation leads to allergies that are increasingly prevalent across the world. Only improved understanding of the \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emechanisms by which microbes, allergens, and tumor cells cause disease will result in the development of diagnostic, therapeutic, and preventative strategies to combat this threat.However, we are only beginning the voyage of immunology, and there is much we still need to research and understand.

C.) records the presence of pestilence and diseases. The study of Immunology stemmed out from the Thucydides\u2019 description of individuals who recovered from the plague in Athens. Those individuals, who had already contracted the disease, recovered and became \u201Cimmune.\u201D Variolation was practiced for many years in China. The process involved exposing healthy people to the material derived from the lesions caused by the disease by either putting it under the skin or, more often, inserting powdered scabs from smallpox pustules into the nose. However, that occasionally resulted in death because there was no standardization of the inoculum. Variolation, later, became popular \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ein England, mainly due to the efforts of Lady Mary Wortley Montague and the American colonies. In 1796, Jenner inoculated James Phipps with the material obtained from a cowpox lesion, which appeared on the hand of a \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edairymaid, and he inoculated the experimental subject with smallpox about six weeks later, without producing disease [1]. In 1875, Robert Koch was able to show the presence of anthrax causing bacteria in the lymph nodes of a dead rabbit that was earlier inoculated with the blood of a diseased animal [2]. In a serendipitous discovery, Pasteur was able to attenuate the virulent chicken cholera bacillus and coined the term vaccination. Later, he developed first viable vaccine for anthrax and rabies while Robert Koch studied hypersensitivity in tuberculosis. Although many consider Louis Pasteur the \u201Cfather of \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eimmunology,\u201D it is due to his and Koch\u2019s efforts that firmly established the historical germ theory of disease. Then, various scientists contributed to the development of the concept of cellular and humoral immunity. While working on the development of digestive organ in starfish larvae, Metchnikoff became a leading proponent of the \u201CCellularists.\u201D He believed that phagocytes, not antibodies, played the leading role in immunity. Emil von Behring and Kitasato demonstrated the transfer of immunity against Diphtheria by a soluble \u201Canti-toxin\u201D in the blood\u0026nbsp; whereby, Paul Ehrlich predicted the existence of immune bodies (antibodies) and side-chains from which they arise (receptors). Ehrlich suggested that antigens interact with receptors borne by cells, resulting in the secretion of excess receptors (antibodies).the supporters of alternative theory, i.e., \u201CHumoralists,\u201D believed that a soluble substance in the body was responsible for mediating immunity \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E OVERVIEW OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPHYSICAL BARRIERS\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eimmunological mechanisms\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETHE INNATE IMMUNE SYSTEM\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETHE ADAPTIVE IMMUNE SYSTEM\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eorgan of immune system\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecells of immune system\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAntigen\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMacrophage\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhat is immune response ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eimmunoglobulin\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eimmunotolerance\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehistocompatibility\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eimmunotherapy\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecytokines\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecomplement system\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegulation of immune response\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eimmunity to infection\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etransplantation immunology\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eautoimmune diseases\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehypersensitivity \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eimmunization\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etumor immunology\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eimmunodiagnostics\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/immunology-step-by-step/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5080764_72e0_2.jpg","duration":"6 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"6,974.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Students who are considering or attending medical school or other health-related professional programs (nursing, pharmacy, PA) \u2013 including those at the high school, undergraduate, and postgraduate levels Professionals looking to improve knowledge for work on health care applications, projects, and research Curious learners with sufficient prerequisites (biology, chemistry, physics) who want to know more"],"tags":["Immunology"],"rating":{"count":33,"averageValue":"3.2"},"instructors":[{"name":"Mohamed AL ashram","url":"/user/mohamed-taha-288/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.05}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"AA7A585AE6D4A977D84C","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/the-intermediate-python-training-boost-your-python-skills/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":3598748,"title":"Intermediate Python Immersive Training | Boost your career","shortDescription":"Develop your Python programming skills and Master next-level Python features","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to The Intermediate Python Immersive Training | Boost your career\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this course, you will learn in depth the most important Python language topics for the intermediate level.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you have completed this course, you will be able to use all these techniques, which we will list in detail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a wonderful feature in this course, as it explains in important detail all you need in these topics in a direct and practical way that saves you valuable time and effort.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you have completed this course, you will be able to understand and use the following techniques in your Python programs:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIterator from fruitstuple and print each value,\u0026nbsp;
