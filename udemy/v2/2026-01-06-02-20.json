It assumes that you\u0027re new to the language, so it gets you started with basic functionality such as creating functions, creating variables, and calling these lines of code from your standard HTML pages. It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E*\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E javascript course contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript introduction\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript array\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript variables\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript functions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript objects\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript control statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript cookies\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript loop statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript data structures\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript error handling\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript regular expressions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/css-bootstrap-javascript-web-development-course/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4548492_0942.jpg","duration":"5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"117,514.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Beginner Full Stack Developers","Beginner Web Developer"],"tags":["CSS","JavaScript","Web Development"],"rating":{"count":1914,"averageValue":"4.4"},"instructors":[{"name":"PROPER DOT INSTITUTE","url":"/user/vivek-dahibhate-2/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.345588}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"4AEB51079F9B1E246703","originalPrice":"\u20B92,509","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/c-and-php-complete-course-2023/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5049552,"title":"C\u002B\u002B And PHP Complete Course for C\u002B\u002B and PHP Beginners","shortDescription":"Learn C\u002B\u002B And PHP Course, Learn Basics And Advanced C\u002B\u002B And Java In This C\u002B\u002B And PHP Two In One Complete Course","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELearn C\u002B\u002B And PHP Course, Learn Basics And Advanced C\u002B\u002B And Java In This C\u002B\u002B And PHP Two In One Complete Course \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESection 1: C\u002B\u002B Complete Course\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis course will help you learn C\u002B\u002B basics and give you hands-on experience to create your own projects and work with computer memory.

The course explains the \u003Cstrong\u003Etwo main types of ELISA used in poultry diagnostics\u003C/strong\u003E: \u003Cstrong\u003EIndirect ELISA\u003C/strong\u003E and \u003Cstrong\u003EBlocking (Competitive) ELISA\u003C/strong\u003E, highlighting their differences, advantages, limitations, and proper use in disease detection and vaccination evaluation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA major part of this course focuses on how ELISA is used to \u003Cstrong\u003Ediagnose common avian diseases\u003C/strong\u003E, such as \u003Cstrong\u003ENewcastle Disease (ND), Avian Influenza (AI), Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV)\u003C/strong\u003E, and Marek\u2019s Disease. You will learn how to interpret \u003Cstrong\u003Eantibody titers\u003C/strong\u003E to determine whether birds are responding to vaccination, exposed to infection, or experiencing a disease outbreak. The course also demonstrates how ELISA is used to \u003Cstrong\u003Edetect foodborne pathogens\u003C/strong\u003E, including \u003Cstrong\u003ESalmonella\u003C/strong\u003E and \u003Cstrong\u003EE. coli\u003C/strong\u003E, supporting \u003Cstrong\u003Efood safety and public health protection\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the end of this course, you will be able to \u003Cstrong\u003Eperform ELISA assays, interpret results accurately, evaluate flock immunity\u003C/strong\u003E, and make informed decisions to improve \u003Cstrong\u003Edisease control, vaccination effectiveness, and production performance\u003C/strong\u003E.

We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables.

Next, denature the DNA to single strands at 94\u02DAC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Rapidly cool the DNA (37-65\u02DAC) and anneal primers to \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecomplementary s.s. sequences flanking the target DNA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.

DNA template is denatured to single strands.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. DNA primer (with 3\u2019 end near sequence of interest) is annealed to \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe template DNA and extended with DNA polymerase.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Four reactions are set up, each containing:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. DNA template\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Primer annealed to template DNA\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. DNA polymerase\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. dNTPS (dATP, dTTP, dCTP, and dGTP)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Next, a different radio-labeled dideoxynucleotide (ddATP, ddTTP, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EddCTP, or ddGTP) is added to each of the four reaction tubes at \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1/100th the concentration of normal dNTPs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. ddNTPs possess a 3\u2019-H instead of 3\u2019-OH, compete in the reaction with \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enormal dNTPS, and produce no phosphodiester bond.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Whenever the radio-labeled ddNTPs are incorporated in the chain, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDNA synthesis terminates.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Each of the four reaction mixtures produces a population of DNA \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emolecules with DNA chains terminating at all possible positions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. Extension products in each of the four reaction mixutes\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ealso end with a different radio-labeled ddNTP\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(depending on the base).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9. Next, each reaction mixture is electrophoresed in a \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eseparate lane (4 lanes) at high voltage on a \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Epolyacrylamide gel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10.Pattern of bands in each of the four lanes is visualized \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eon X-ray film.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E11.Location of \u201Cbands\u201D in each of the four lanes indicate \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe size of the fragment terminating with a respective \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eradio-labeled ddNTP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E12.DNA sequence is deduced from the pattern of bands in \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe 4 lanes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAutomated Dye-Terminator DNA Sequencing:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Dideoxy DNA sequencing was time consuming, radioactive, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand throughput was low, typically ~300 bp per run.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Automated DNA sequencing employs the same general \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eprocedure, but uses ddNTPs labeled with fluorescent dyes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Combine 4 dyes in one reaction tube and electrophores in \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eone lane on a polyacrylamide gel or capillary containing \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Epolyacrylamide.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. UV laser detects dyes and reads the sequence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Sequence data is displayed as colored peaks \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(chromatograms) that correspond to the position of each \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enucleotide in the sequence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6.
