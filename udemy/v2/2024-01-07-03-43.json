It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E*\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E javascript course contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript introduction\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript array\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript variables\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript functions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript objects\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript control statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript cookies\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript loop statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript data structures\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript error handling\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript regular expressions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003Esection 3- learn PHP\u0026nbsp;programming language\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis section will learn the basic structure of a web application and how a web browser interacts with a web server.

Zero trust architectures simplify network infrastructure, make users happier, and keep cyberthreats at a distance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince John Kindervag, then at Forrester Research, coined the phrase, zero trust architectures follow the maxim \u0022never trust, always verify.\u0022 To block inappropriate access and lateral movement throughout an environment, zero trust architecture enforces access policies based on context\u2014including the user\u0027s role and location, the device they\u0027re using, and the data they\u0027re asking for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA zero trust architecture means you know who\u0027s using what, and you can track it, including encrypted traffic; you need to monitor and verify the traffic between parts of the environment; and you need multifactor authentication (MFA) that goes beyond passwords.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn important thing to remember is that in a zero trust architecture, a resource\u0027s location isn\u0027t as important as before. Rather than rigid network segmentation, software-defined microsegmentation protects your data, workflows, services, and such anywhere, in your data center or distributed hybrid or multicloud.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy using a network-centric data security strategy that provides specific access only to those who need it, Zero Trust Architecture focuses on the business needs and functionality of an organization. By enabling parameters to dictate access and restrictions, the Zero Trust model views data security from a whole new perspective. As opposed to legacy networks that have little to no visibility or control over network and data usage, Zero Trust Architectures see all network traffic through segmentation gateways with granular policies governing access to data, apps, and assets. There are certain rules that have to be followed before a resource can be accessed in a Zero Trust network.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe five major topics I want to cover in this master\u0027s course are\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

In this master course, we\u0027ll delve into the fundamental concepts of machine learning at a 101 level. Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that empowers computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without explicit programming. Understanding these basics will lay the groundwork for your journey into the vast and ever-evolving field of machine learning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMachine learning is a branch of AI that focuses on creating algorithms and models that can learn from data.

The goal is for the model to learn a mapping function that can predict the output for unseen inputs accurately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eb) Unsupervised Learning: Unlike supervised learning, unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data. The algorithm\u0027s objective is to find patterns and structures in the data without explicit guidance. Clustering and dimensionality reduction are typical tasks in unsupervised learning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ec) Reinforcement Learning: This type of learning is inspired by behavioral psychology, where an agent interacts with an environment and learns to take actions that maximize rewards or minimize penalties. The agent explores the environment and learns from the feedback it receives.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Machine Learning Process\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe typical machine learning process involves several key steps:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea) Data Collection: Obtaining relevant and high-quality data is crucial for successful machine learning models. The data should be representative of the problem you want to solve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eb) Data Preprocessing: This step involves cleaning the data, handling missing values, and transforming the data into a suitable format for training the models.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ec) Feature Engineering: Selecting and creating relevant features from the data is an essential part of building effective machine learning models. Good features can significantly impact the model\u0027s performance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ed) Model Selection: Choosing an appropriate algorithm or model architecture for the task at hand is essential. The choice of model depends on the problem type (classification, regression, etc.) and the nature of the data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ee) Model Training: In this step, the model is exposed to the training data to learn the underlying patterns and relationships.
