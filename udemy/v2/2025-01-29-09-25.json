This forms the basis for everything else. The central object in Numpy is the Numpy array, on which you can do various operations. We know that the matrix and arrays play an important role in numerical computation and data analysis. Pandas and other ML or AI tools need tabular or array-like data to work efficiently, so using NumPy in Pandas and ML packages can reduce the time and improve the performance of the data computation. NumPy based arrays are 10 to 100 times (even more than 100 times) faster than the Python Lists, hence if you are planning to work as a Data Analyst or Data Scientist or Big Data Engineer with Python, then you must be familiar with the NumPy as it offers a more convenient way to work with Matrix-like objects like Nd-arrays. And also we\u2019re going to do a demo where we prove that using a Numpy vectorized operation is faster than normal Python lists.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if you want to learn about the fastest python-based numerical multidimensional data processing framework, which is the foundation for many data science packages like pandas for data analysis, sklearn, scikit-learn for the machine learning algorithm, you are at the right place and right track.

Examples of digital platforms include e-commerce websites like Amazon, social media platforms like Facebook, and software-as-a-service (SaaS) platforms like Salesforce.","Ecosystems:  Digital ecosystems refer to interconnected networks of organizations, individuals, and technologies that collaborate and coexist within a shared digital environment. These ecosystems are characterized by interdependence and collaboration, where different entities contribute to and benefit from the ecosystem\u0027s overall value creation. For instance, Apple\u0027s ecosystem includes developers who create apps, users who consume them, and Apple itself as the platform provider.","Importance for Companies and Managers:  Market Expansion: Digital platforms and ecosystems offer companies unparalleled opportunities to reach global markets and engage with diverse customer segments.  Innovation: They foster innovation by providing a fertile ground for experimentation, co-creation, and the rapid deployment of new products and services.  Customer Engagement: These platforms enable companies to gather vast amounts of data on customer behavior, preferences, and feedback, allowing for more personalized and targeted marketing strategies.  Efficiency: By leveraging digital platforms, companies can streamline operations, automate processes, and reduce costs.  Competitive Advantage: Understanding and harnessing digital platforms and ecosystems can confer a significant competitive advantage, enabling companies to stay ahead of rivals in a rapidly evolving marketplace."],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":29,"averageValue":"4.4"},"instructors":[{"name":"MTF Institute of Management, Technology and Finance","url":"/user/mtfinstitute/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.327586}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"39F4F2C0AB88069549C2","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"3 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-javascript-programming-from-novice-to-expert/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":6173757,"title":"Complete JavaScript Programming: From Novice to Expert","shortDescription":"Become a JavaScript Pro: Step-by-Step Training from Basic Programming to Advanced Web Development Skills.","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EEmbark on a transformative journey with \u003Cstrong\u003EComplete JavaScript Programming: From Novice to Expert\u003C/strong\u003E, an all-encompassing course designed to take you from a beginner to a seasoned JavaScript developer.
