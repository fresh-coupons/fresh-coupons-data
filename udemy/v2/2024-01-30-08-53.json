Lastly, at the end of the course, you will conduct testing on the fraud detection model to make sure it produces accurate results and functions as it should.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, before getting into the course, we need to ask ourselves this question: why should we build a credit card fraud detection model? Well, here is my answer. In the past couple of years, we have witnessed a significant increase in the number of people conducting online transactions and, consequently, the risk of credit card fraud has surged. As technology advances, so do the techniques employed by fraudsters. Building a credit card fraud detection model becomes imperative to safeguard financial transactions, protect users from unauthorized activities, and maintain the integrity of online payment systems. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and data-driven insights, we can proactively identify and prevent fraudulent transactions. Last but not least, knowing how to build a complex fraud detection model can potentially open a lot of opportunities in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow are things that you can expect to learn from this course:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn the basic fundamentals of fraud detection model\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how credit card fraud detection models work.

It assumes that you\u0027re new to the language, so it gets you started with basic functionality such as creating functions, creating variables, and calling these lines of code from your standard HTML pages. It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E*\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E javascript course contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript introduction\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript array\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript variables\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript functions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript objects\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript control statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript cookies\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript loop statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript data structures\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript error handling\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript regular expressions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESection 4- python programming language.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis course section provides an introduction to programming and the python language. students are introduced to core python programming concepts like conditionals, loops, variables, and functions. this section includes an overview of the various python aspects.

By addressing stigma, we can create an environment where individuals feel comfortable seeking help, receiving appropriate care, and living fulfilling lives. Mental health stigma refers to the negative attitudes, beliefs, and stereotypes that surround mental health and mental illness. It involves prejudiced judgments, discrimination, and the marginalization of individuals with mental health conditions. Stigma can manifest at various levels, including societal, interpersonal, and self-stigma. Addressing mental health stigma involves promoting awareness, education, and challenging misconceptions. Efforts to reduce stigma aim to create a more supportive and understanding environment for individuals with mental health conditions, fostering a society where mental health is treated with the same importance and empathy as physical health. The objective of this course is to understand and explore the concept and types of mental health stigma, examine how mental health stigma affects individuals and society and develop strategies to combat mental health stigma. This course aims to help educators, students, research scholars, mental health practitioners and counselors to understand and apply strategies for combating mental health stigma and promoting mental health resilience.

Epithelium, connective tissue, muscle tissue, and nervous tissue have commonalities but look very distinct structurally after staining. Each stain exists to highlight an important feature or component within a tissue type. For example, one of the most common stains, Hematoxylin, is a basic dye that stains proteins a blue color, while Eosin stains proteins a pink color. These two stains are commonly used together to define intracellular organelles and proteins. Because of the variety of the proteins that exist, some stains were created to highlight a particular protein, which this review will discuss in the following sections. The benefit of using a special stain is that it can highlight the specific protein very well. However, because of its specificity, the other structures will not be seen. For this reason, multiple slides will often be created from a given specimen so that multiple stains can be performed to gather the full range of needed information.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlmost all tissue stains are performed on tissue that has been removed from the body. However, in rare instances, very specialize stains called vital stains can work on tissue remaining in the body. These stains are used for the identification of specific types of tissue and identification of abnormal tissue, so a subsequent biopsy can be more accurate in obtaining abnormal tissue\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETissue Preparation\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore specific staining can occur, tissue samples must undergo preparation through the following stages: Fixation, processing, embedding, sectioning, and sometimes antigen retrieval. In modern histology laboratories, most of these steps are automated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E.\u003Cstrong\u003EFixation: \u003C/strong\u003EFixation uses chemicals to preserve the structure of the tissue in its natural form and protects it from degradation by irreversibly cross-linking proteins. Although several specialized fixatives are available, Neutral Buffered Formalin is a common choice for this step. The fixation step is vital to the rest of the histologic staining procedure because by retaining the chemical composition of the tissue, the sample is hardened and makes the sectioning phase easier. Paraffin-formalin is another effective fixative. Its benefit is that it is the fixative of choice for immunostaining; however, it requires preparation at the time of the fixation. Bouin is a fixative used for examining embryo and brain tissue because of its superior preservation of delicate nuclei and glycogen. Its downside is that it does not preserve kidney tissues well and also distorts mitochondrial structure.[1]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDehydration: \u003C/strong\u003EThe addition of ethanol accomplishes the dehydration of a sample. It removed water from the sample and further hardens the tissue for eventual light microscopy. After ethanol is applied, and following the completion of tissue dehydration, xylene is used to remove the ethanol.[1]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEmbedding: \u003C/strong\u003EEmbedding is the process of putting the sample into a paraffin wax or a plastic resin to enhance the process of extracting cellular structures. This step is to be performed with caution if the goal is to perform immunostaining because the paraffin wax will inhibit the penetration of antibodies, and lead to a false result.[1]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESectioning: \u003C/strong\u003ESectioning involves mounting the specimen on a microtome and cutting it into sections. The preferred thickness is 4-5 micrometers so that it can be stained and put on a microscope slide for examination.[1]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAntigen Retrieval: \u003C/strong\u003EThis step is to retrieve antigens that could have been covered in the fixation and embedding stages. If the cross-linking of proteins conceals the antigen sites, there may not be as robust of an immunohistochemical response. Antigen retrieval is achieved through heating and proteolytic methods to break down the cross-links and reveal the epitopes and antigens that were previously covered.[1] Although this step carries the risk of denaturing both the fixative and the antigens themselves, a successful antigen retrieval method can lead to a much more effective immunostaining intensity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/histology-step-by-step/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5080670_193b.jpg","duration":"1.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"1,810.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Medical students, science students ,nursing students ,medical protectional"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":3,"averageValue":"4.2"},"instructors":[{"name":"Mohamed AL ashram","url":"/user/mohamed-taha-288/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.1666665}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"ED3C9AC8A6EBD65FC6ED","originalPrice":"\u20B93,499","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/speak-arbic-like-natives/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4389568,"title":"speak Arabic like natives","shortDescription":"listen to speak","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EArabic is an old language \u003C/strong\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E It is believed to have originated in the Arabian Peninsula. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArabic, which first emerged in the northwest of the Arabian Peninsula, is a member of the \u003Cstrong\u003ESemitic family of languages \u003C/strong\u003Ewhich also includes Hebrew and Aramaic.
