In this master course, we\u0027ll delve into the fundamental concepts of machine learning at a 101 level. Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that empowers computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without explicit programming. Understanding these basics will lay the groundwork for your journey into the vast and ever-evolving field of machine learning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMachine learning is a branch of AI that focuses on creating algorithms and models that can learn from data. Instead of being explicitly programmed to perform specific tasks, machine learning models can identify patterns and relationships in the data and make decisions or predictions based on those patterns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMachine learning has the potential to revolutionize various industries and improve decision-making processes. In this master course, we\u0027ve covered the fundamentals of machine learning at a 101 level, introducing you to key concepts like supervised and unsupervised learning, the machine learning process, and evaluation metrics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETypes of Machine Learning\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are three main types of machine learning:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea) Supervised Learning: In this type, the algorithm learns from labeled data, meaning it\u0027s provided with input-output pairs during the training phase. The goal is for the model to learn a mapping function that can predict the output for unseen inputs accurately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eb) Unsupervised Learning: Unlike supervised learning, unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data. The algorithm\u0027s objective is to find patterns and structures in the data without explicit guidance. Clustering and dimensionality reduction are typical tasks in unsupervised learning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ec) Reinforcement Learning: This type of learning is inspired by behavioral psychology, where an agent interacts with an environment and learns to take actions that maximize rewards or minimize penalties. The agent explores the environment and learns from the feedback it receives.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Machine Learning Process\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe typical machine learning process involves several key steps:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea) Data Collection: Obtaining relevant and high-quality data is crucial for successful machine learning models. The data should be representative of the problem you want to solve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eb) Data Preprocessing: This step involves cleaning the data, handling missing values, and transforming the data into a suitable format for training the models.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ec) Feature Engineering: Selecting and creating relevant features from the data is an essential part of building effective machine learning models. Good features can significantly impact the model\u0027s performance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ed) Model Selection: Choosing an appropriate algorithm or model architecture for the task at hand is essential. The choice of model depends on the problem type (classification, regression, etc.) and the nature of the data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ee) Model Training: In this step, the model is exposed to the training data to learn the underlying patterns and relationships. The algorithm adjusts its parameters to minimize the prediction errors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ef) Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model\u0027s performance on a separate set of data (validation or test set) is essential to ensure it generalizes well to unseen data and avoids overfitting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eg) Model Deployment: After a successful evaluation, the model can be deployed in a real-world setting to make predictions or decisions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEvaluation Metrics\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo assess the performance of a machine learning model, various evaluation metrics are used, depending on the type of problem. For classification tasks, metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are commonly used. For regression tasks, mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) are popular metrics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you continue your journey into the world of machine learning, remember that practice is crucial. Experiment with different datasets, algorithms, and model architectures to gain hands-on experience.

In this course you will learn how to use JavaScript along with two powerful JavaScript libraries to build dynamic, interactive web pages. We start with introducing students to the document object model (DOM) which defines the logical structure of HTML documents. From there we dive into JavaScript to demonstrate various methods in which DOM elements can be manipulated to add interactivity to static components. The JavaScript section starts right from the basics, which includes JavaScript placement, and data output. From there we move on to variable declaration, arithmetic operations, operator precedence, data types, and objects. Once the foundations are covered, we move on to more complex operations using Arrays, Conditional Statements, JavaScript comparison operators, booleans and loops. Here students will learn to unleash the true power of JavaScript to render different outcomes based on user interaction. We will explore the use of functions to efficiently handle repetitive tasks and JavaScript events to handle output based on actions and occurrences. The section will conclude with a hands-on project where students will implement their knowledge to build a web based photo gallery and background color changer.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn the second section of this course, students will learn to work with jQuery - a powerful JavaScript library designed to simplify HTML DOM tree traversal and manipulation. jQuery is ultra lightweight, feature rich, and cross-platform compatible. It\u2019s one of the easiest libraries to work with for building out JavaScript features on an HTML web page. jQuery is excellent for event handling, CSS animations, and Ajax integration for asynchronous UI state changes. Similar to the JavaScript section, the jQuery module begins with the foundations. This includes instructions on embedding jQuery to a web page, and an intro into jQuery syntax. Students will learn to work with jQuery selectors, events, and toggling. From there we dive into animations using fades, slides, and the jQuery animate function. Students also learn about chaining, draggable objects, callback functions, the get content method, toggling classes, and filtering. By the end of the jQuery module, you will know how to build stunning animated web pages with ease.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn the last section of this course we\u2019ll explore React - a cutting edge JavaScript library for building state-of-the art user interface components. You\u2019ve likely seen React in action on some of the hottest web apps developed by fortune 500 companies. For example, Netflix, Facebook, and AirBnB all use React for their front-end UI. As a matter of fact, React was developed by Meta alongside a community of independent developers. Until this day, React remains free and open-source so it has plenty of support and documentation. Unlike jQuery which interacts with the document object model directly, React works through a \u201Cvirtual\u201D DOM. React is unaware of changes made to the DOM outside of React and determines updates based on its own internal representations. React is best for creating reusable code blocks for UI components and layering them on top of each other to minimize the number of times the DOM needs to be re-rendering on state changes. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe React section of this course starts off with a hands-on project where you\u2019ll learn how to work with functional React components, props, Callback functions, OnClick Events, and the React State hook to build a fully functional calculator. From there we will dive into project number two, where you will build a connect-4 clone. Here we will cover more intermediate concepts including passing props, destructuring, passing arguments to click events, various styling methods, and handling callbacks. You will also learn about the React key property, React lifecycle events, and conditional rendering. By the end you will have built a complete multi and single player connect-4 game board with built-in AI capabilities. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn the final section of the course we further unleash the power of React by building out a complete e-commerce site with multiple product categories, a product showcase, shopping cart feature, and much more. Here, we introduce a number of integral new concepts including: JSON server, Fetch API, and installing React router. These essential building blocks will be used to render the product categories, style the product list, and configure the product details page. From there we dive into styled components, refactoring the shop layout, and exploring the concept of \u201Ccontext\u201D in React. In the final stages of the project students will configure the shopping cart basket, and the checkout feature. We will also implement a product search feature, followed by in-depth exercises on validating input forms in React.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAs you can see this course covers a tremendous bit of ground. Best of all it\u2019s co-authored by Tim Maclachlan - a renowned senior full-stack developer with over 20 years of commercial development experience. As a multi-faceted developer, Tim specializes in algorithmic, analytical and mobile development. To date, he\u2019s written hundreds of applications and worked in a number of industries from commercial aviation and military, to banking and finance. Tim has a genuine passion for teaching others how to become better coders and looks forward to interacting with his students.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWith that said, we hope you\u2019re just as excited about this course as we are, if so - hit that enroll button and let\u2019s get started.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-javascript-jquery-and-react-bootcamp-hands-on/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4789948_a375.jpg","duration":"13 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"53,913.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Students interested in working with Popular JavaScript Libraries","Students interested in Building Interactive UI Components using React and jQuery","Students interested in Mastering Front-End Development using JavaScript"],"tags":["JavaScript","jQuery","React JS"],"rating":{"count":373,"averageValue":"4.6"},"instructors":[{"name":"YouAccel Training","url":"/user/youaccel/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.5588236}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"YOUACCEL14907","originalPrice":"\u20B91,999","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"11 hours","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/i-want-to-be-a-celebrity/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5182792,"title":"Become a Celebrity in Your Industry on LinkedIn","shortDescription":"I created this 7-day easy-to-follow workshop to support professionals who are targeting new people to engage with online","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBecome a Celebrity in Your Industry\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u2019ve hobnobbed with some cool celebrities.
