This course doesn\u0027t require you to have any prior experience in this software or any other structural design software. It will teach all the aspects of the software from very basic and will take you to the higher levels of the software as the course progresses. The course has been very systematically arranged so that you can best understand the software. Once you complete this course, you will have all the necessary knowledge to do the structural design of a building. You can do the structural design of buildings on your own projects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe spent years at college but yet there are some topics that are overlooked in the engineering syllabus but are important in working fields. This course titled \u0022 ETABS: Structural Analysis and Design of a Building\u0022 has been created in order to fill that void and help students start out with structural design software. ETABS is a structural analysis and design software developed by csiamerica. It is a very powerful software that can design almost any kind of civil engineering structure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EETABS is used for the design of beam and columns only. However, this course also contains the design of slab and the footing. \u003C/strong\u003EUnlike other courses available online which only teach you tools of ETABS and not the actual process of analysis and design, this course takes a real-world architectural drawing of a building so as to explain the entire process from modeling up to the design.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/etabs-from-zero-to-hero/","imageUri":"https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5419432_c578_2.jpg","duration":"5.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"2,004.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Civil engineering students","Civil engineering graduates"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":6,"averageValue":"4.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"Ashish Pandit","url":"/user/ashish-pandit-56/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.0833335}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"5D01587CAC4F567DB06D","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"3 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-guide-to-ebay-selling-as-a-business/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":3990182,"title":"Complete Guide to eBay Selling as a Business","shortDescription":"Learn how to Build and Grow your eBay Business for Dropship or Merchant Fulfilled","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELearn how to make the most of selling on eBay \u2013 one of the world\u0027s largest online marketplace and a fantastic opportunity for entrepreneurs\u003C/strong\u003E. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStart an eBay business and boost your income or escape the 9-to-5!

It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E*\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E javascript course contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript introduction\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript array\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript variables\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript functions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript objects\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript control statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript cookies\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript loop statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript data structures\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript error handling\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript regular expressions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003Esection 2- learn PHP\u0026nbsp;programming language\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis section will learn the basic structure of a web application and how a web browser interacts with a web server.

The course fast tracks their success in international trade supported by the latest technological tools. Also, the course gives a complete basic understanding of the concept of Blockchain \u0026amp; Crypto and its foreign trade applications. As you may know, Blockchain is a revolutionary technology. And, it could be brought about by the recent advancement in ICT and the internet. After the internet, Blockchain is the biggest technological revolution.

Therefore, the technology gives a new meaning to digital currencies. Also, recent knowledge indicates that blockchain technology can prove to be a great enabler for MSME businesses. As a result, it can help them carry out international trading activities more safely. And that too at the least costs. So, Blockchain and Crypto technology have the potential to significantly reduce several types of middlemen costs. At the same time, these high costs are currently associated with international business transactions. Interestingly, the technology has the potential to significantly improve business efficiencies. Which are related to exports transactions. These are in terms of speed of movement of goods and reduction of paperwork.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat All this Blockchain and Crypto Course Covers?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis blockchain and Crypto course also covers all topics related to the basic terminologies used in the Blockchain ecosystem.

The only constructive critique I would give would be concerning the technical form of the presentation, more specifically the video quality and picture aesthetic. Going by the current standard as it applies to video, everything we view is in high definition. Having said that, I believe the video quality could be improved upon as well as the backdrop which I found to be a bit generic and outdated.
