By the end of the course, students will have the skills necessary to build a fully customizable e-commerce site on an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance. The entire infrastructure will be highly available and scalable using Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs) and Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs). \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe course begins by introducing students to AWS and the various services it offers. This includes a brief overview of the AWS management console and how to navigate it. From there, we delve deeper into the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) service. EC2 will serve as the backbone of the e-commerce site we build using React.JS. Students will learn how to launch and configure EC2 instances, as well as how to connect to them securely using remote connection utilities like PuTTY and Terminal. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ENext, we will cover AWS Storage, including Elastic Block Store (EBS) and Elastic File System (EFS). Here, students learn to create and manage storage volumes, and how to securely connect them to EC2 instances. We also explore the different types of storage available on AWS and when to use each one.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAfter covering the basics, students learn to create Elastic Load Balancers and integrate them with Auto Scaling Groups for workload distribution. Here, we demonstrate how to create a highly available and scalable infrastructure for the e-commerce site which will be built in the last section of the course. The infrastructure will automatically scale based on traffic and overall load. Traffic will only be distributed to healthy nodes in the network, based on parameters that are established during configuration. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EFinally, students learn how to build a fully customizable e-commerce site using React.js. Here, students will create and manage a React project, as well as effectively use React components to build a dynamic user interface. We also explore how to integrate the e-commerce site with other AWS services such as AWS storage, to efficiently scale capacity based on application requirements.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThroughout the course, students will work on hands-on projects to apply the concepts they have learned. These projects include building a simple e-commerce site to start and scaling up to a more complex site with advanced features such as product search, and product categories.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EBy the end of the course, students will have a solid understanding of the basics of AWS and React.js. Students will be able to build a fully functional and customizable e-commerce site on an EC2 instance. This includes having the knowledge and skills necessary to continue learning more advanced AWS and React.js concepts and being able to build out new projects independently.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThis course is designed for developers and IT professionals who want to learn how to build scalable and highly available applications on AWS using React.js.

The focus of the course will be on four key services, including: Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), AWS Storage Solutions, and Elastic Load Balancers (ELB) integrated with Auto Scaling Groups (ASG). \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAmazon EC2 is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It allows users to launch virtual machines (VMs) on demand and pay only for the compute resources they use. In this course, we will explore the different types of instances available, as well as how to launch, configure, and manage EC2 instances.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn addition to the EC2 service, we also explore AWS storage solutions including Elastic Block Store (EBS), Elastic File System (EFS), Snapshots, and Amazon Machine Images (AMIs). EBS is a block-level storage service for use with EC2 instances. It provides persistent storage for data that needs to be frequently accessed. EFS is a file-level storage service for use with EC2 instances. It allows users to create and configure file systems that can be accessed from multiple instances. Snapshots are point-in-time copies of EBS volumes that can be used for backup and recovery. AMIs are pre-configured virtual machine images that can be used to launch EC2 instances. In this course, we will explore the different storage options available and how to use them to manage data on the AWS platform.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOnce students have a handle on the foundations, we explore more intermediate topics relevant to workload distribution through the integration of ELBs and ASGs. Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs) are used to distribute incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances. They automatically scale to handle incoming traffic and can also be used to improve availability and fault tolerance. In this course, we will explore the different types of load balancers available, as well as how to configure and use them to distribute traffic across multiple instances.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWe will demonstrate how to integrate the ELBs with Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs) to ensure workloads are only distributed to healthy nodes within the EC2 service. ASGs allow users to automatically scale the number of EC2 instances in response to changing demand. They automatically launch and terminate instances based on predefined rules, ensuring that the number of instances is always sufficient to handle incoming traffic.

Best practice is to use the Conversions API in addition to the Facebook pixel to help maximize the effectiveness of your website events.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Conversions API is designed to create a direct and reliable connection between marketing data (such as website events and offline conversions) from your server, website platform or CRM to Facebook. This marketing data helps power ad personalization, optimization and measurement on Facebook so that your ads are shown to people who are more likely to be interested in them. There are several options you can use to set up the Conversions API. Many integrations don\u0027t require a developer, and if you use a commerce platform such as Shopify you can set up the Conversions API in just a few clicks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThe Conversions API can help you to:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReduce your cost per action as a result of improved connectivity.

One type of marketing data is website events, which are actions that people take on your website. For example, making a purchase or adding an item to their cart. As people interact with your business, integration methods like the Conversions API and Facebook pixel share those events with Facebook. Events help power your Facebook ads so you can reach a more relevant audience, provide a more personalized ad experience and optimize your ad campaigns towards better business outcomes. Events take place either as a result of Facebook ads (paid) or organic reach (unpaid).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELearn How to Use, Setup \u0026amp; Optimise Meta Aggregated Events\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFacebook\u2019s Aggregated Event Measurement is a protocol that allows for measurement of web events from iOS 14 users.

Some of which will be good and many are just plain harmful. One of the reasons why my weight loss program is ideal for most people is that it leans heavily on using the natural body movements with long-term approaches to achieve results. It does not promise you a 1-week result without any effort. But it is perfect for those who have not done much for so many years and want to start. Plus those who have gone through the yo-yo periods of dieting and weight loss programs will also find it useful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E________________________________________________________________________\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EWhat is the proof that it has worked?\u003C/em\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEverything I have spoken to people who have lost weight and continue to maintain their weight I have been fascinated by how they all seem to enjoy the process, look great and confident they can continue. Whenever I have asked how they have arrived at their ideal weight and attitude the response has always been the same; it take long term consistent effort. Here lies one of the big secrets. We used to think some were either born to look trim whiles other were born to be overweight but the truth is that anyone can change the way they look by consistent, action towards a goal. Sooner or later you will get there. Hence, the program detailed in the course is to help you achieve the weight they want by starting with a small habit that will propel you towards the destination you want!

All the data of the Universe may be stored there, but this \u201Ccomputer\u201D is also limited. Our human brain can only reproduce what has been fed into it. But in meditation, we experience pure being. The moment the intellect is still and the individual ego ceases to exist, Divine light shines within the heart and we are one with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESamadhi - Complete Realisation\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESamadhi is where the knower, knowledge and object of knowledge unite. The knower (i.e. the person practicing), knowledge (i.e. what is God) and the object of knowledge (i.e. God) become one. This means that one unites with the Divine consciousness. Those who attain Samadhi see a heavenly, radiant light, hear a heavenly sound and feel within themselves an infinite expanse. When Samadhi is attained, we are like a river that finally flows into the sea after a long and difficult journey. All obstacles are overcome and the river is, for all of time, united with the ocean. In the same way, a Yogi arrives at the end of the path and becomes one with the Supreme Consciousness. The Yogi\u0027s consciousness finds eternal quiet, peace and bliss - the Yogi is liberated.
