Or does your child\u2019s fantasy play seem to consist only of repetitive movements which has no story to them? I am sure yo are aware of such situation\u2026 Now-a-days children are no longer as creative as they once were.\u0026nbsp; We live in an era obsessed with numbers, data, and test scores, especially as they apply to our kids and their education.\u0026nbsp; Seeing the decline in creativity should make us concerned about our children\u2019s capacities to innovate, problem-solve, and navigate new and unfamiliar situations. \u0026nbsp;\n\n\u0026nbsp; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the world of child development you may hear the phrases like \u201Ccritical thinking skills\u201D and \u201Ccreative problem-solving abilities\u201D when referring to goals for your child\u2019s cognitive development. What we are really talking about is\u2026 imagination. The way to create human beings with imagination is to provide them with opportunities to develop it for themselves when they are very young. These opportunities are found in one place and one place only\u2026 that is, play. Playing with paints, playing with play dough, with costumes, with glue and with crayons. Making a mess. Exploring the woods. Splashing in a puddle. Wondering at a caterpillar you notice inching by you. Pretending to be a bird, gliding through the sky. All these involves great deal of imagination and developing their creative skills to many fold.\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, as parents we must first learn the process of creative learning which we can offer to our kids. We parents should make ourselves aware of the different aspects of creative learning and critical thinking skills so that we can create an environment for our children to flourish in that environment. \n\n\u0026nbsp; In this course, we are going to discuss in details the step-by-step process which you can walk your children through to make them a creative learner and achiever.

It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat are the steps I should follow to be able to build a Machine Learning model?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can divide your learning process into 3 parts:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStatistics and Probability - Implementing Machine learning techniques require basic knowledge of Statistics and probability concepts. Second section of the course covers this part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnderstanding of Machine learning - Fourth section helps you understand the terms and concepts associated with Machine learning and gives you the steps to be followed to build a machine learning model\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProgramming Experience - A significant part of machine learning is programming. Python and R clearly stand out to be the leaders in the recent days. Third section will help you set up the Python environment and teach you some basic operations. In later sections there is a video on how to implement each concept taught in theory lecture in Python\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnderstanding of\u0026nbsp; models - Fifth and sixth section cover Classification models and with each theory lecture comes a corresponding practical lecture where we actually run each query with you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy use R for Machine Learning?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnderstanding R is one of the valuable skills needed for a career in Machine Learning. Below are some reasons why you should learn Machine learning in R\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\t1. It\u2019s a popular language for Machine Learning at top tech firms. Almost all of them hire data scientists who use R. Facebook, for example, uses R to do behavioral analysis with user post data. Google uses R to assess ad effectiveness and make economic forecasts. And by the way, it\u2019s not just tech firms: R is in use at analysis and consulting firms, banks and other financial institutions, academic institutions and research labs, and pretty much everywhere else data needs analyzing and visualizing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\t2. Learning the data science basics is arguably easier in R. R has a big advantage: it was designed specifically with data manipulation and analysis in mind. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\t3. Amazing packages that make your life easier. Because R was designed with statistical analysis in mind, it has a fantastic ecosystem of packages and other resources that are great for data science. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\t4. Robust, growing community of data scientists and statisticians. As the field of data science has exploded, R has exploded with it, becoming one of the fastest-growing languages in the world (as measured by StackOverflow). That means it\u2019s easy to find answers to questions and community guidance as you work your way through projects in R.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\t5. Put another tool in your toolkit. No one language is going to be the right tool for every job. Adding R to your repertoire will make some projects easier \u2013 and of course, it\u2019ll also make you a more flexible and marketable employee when you\u2019re looking for jobs in data science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat is the difference between Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPut simply, machine learning and data mining use the same algorithms and techniques as data mining, except the kinds of predictions vary. While data mining discovers previously unknown patterns and knowledge, machine learning reproduces known patterns and knowledge\u2014and further automatically applies that information to data, decision-making, and actions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDeep learning, on the other hand, uses advanced computing power and special types of neural networks and applies them to large amounts of data to learn, understand, and identify complicated patterns. Automatic language translation and medical diagnoses are examples of deep learning.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"Englisch","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/machine-learning-advanced-decision-trees-in-r/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2401052_2792_3.jpg","duration":"6 Stunden","enrolledStudentsCount":"43.368 Teilnehmer","lastUpdated":"Zuletzt aktualisiert 11/2021","targetAudiences":["People pursuing a career in data science","Working Professionals beginning their Data journey","Statisticians needing more practical experience","Anyone curious to master Decision Tree technique from Beginner to Advanced in short span of time"],"tags":["Programmierung","Data Science","Entscheidungsbaum"],"rating":{"count":108,"averageValue":"4.2"},"instructors":[{"name":"Start-Tech Academy","url":"/user/start-tech-academy/","totalNumberOfStudents":1362698,"totalNumberOfReviews":57979,"averageRating":4.465315500902492}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"ECA1DTR","originalPrice":"1.280\u00A0\u20B9","discountedPrice":"640\u00A0\u20B9","expirationText":"2 Tage","discountPercentage":50}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-and-special-bitcoin-trading-course-in-the-world/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":3427280,"title":"The Complete and Special Bitcoin Trading Course In The World","shortDescription":"The Complete Cryptocurrency and Bitcoin Trading Course 2021 from basics till most advanced tips Trading Crypto \u0026 Altcoin","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003EBitcoin Trading: Trade Bitcoins \u0026amp;

It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy use Python for Machine Learning?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnderstanding Python is one of the valuable skills needed for a career in Machine Learning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough it hasn\u2019t always been, Python is the programming language of choice for data science. Here\u2019s a brief history:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn 2016, it overtook R on Kaggle, the premier platform for data science competitions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn 2017, it overtook R on KDNuggets\u2019s annual poll of data scientists\u2019 most used tools.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn 2018, 66% of data scientists reported using Python daily, making it the number one tool for analytics professionals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMachine Learning experts expect this trend to continue with increasing development in the Python ecosystem. And while your journey to learn Python programming may be just beginning, it\u2019s nice to know that employment opportunities are abundant (and growing) as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy use R for Machine Learning?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnderstanding R is one of the valuable skills needed for a career in Machine Learning. Below are some reasons why you should learn Machine learning in R\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. It\u2019s a popular language for Machine Learning at top tech firms. Almost all of them hire data scientists who use R. Facebook, for example, uses R to do behavioral analysis with user post data. Google uses R to assess ad effectiveness and make economic forecasts. And by the way, it\u2019s not just tech firms: R is in use at analysis and consulting firms, banks and other financial institutions, academic institutions and research labs, and pretty much everywhere else data needs analyzing and visualizing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Learning the data science basics is arguably easier in R. R has a big advantage: it was designed specifically with data manipulation and analysis in mind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Amazing packages that make your life easier. Because R was designed with statistical analysis in mind, it has a fantastic ecosystem of packages and other resources that are great for data science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Robust, growing community of data scientists and statisticians. As the field of data science has exploded, R has exploded with it, becoming one of the fastest-growing languages in the world (as measured by StackOverflow). That means it\u2019s easy to find answers to questions and community guidance as you work your way through projects in R.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Put another tool in your toolkit. No one language is going to be the right tool for every job. Adding R to your repertoire will make some projects easier \u2013 and of course, it\u2019ll also make you a more flexible and marketable employee when you\u2019re looking for jobs in data science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat is the difference between Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPut simply, machine learning and data mining use the same algorithms and techniques as data mining, except the kinds of predictions vary.
