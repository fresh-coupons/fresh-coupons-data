input, sharing of ideas and experiences so the course may actually be a whole lot longer! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe course begins with a brief introduction to music therapy and its benefits, followed by an overview of the theoretical frameworks that underpin music therapy. This includes an explanation of how music can be used to address physical, emotional, cognitive, and social needs. In particular there is an emphasis on the practical experience of one of the Instructors - an accomplished musician with qualifications in NLP and Music Therapy as well. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe majority of the course is devoted to demonstrating different techniques and approaches used in music therapy, such as improvisation, songwriting, and receptive listening. Each technique is explained in detail, along with examples of how they have been used successfully in real-life situations. The course also includes case studies of successful music therapy interventions and a discussion of the challenges and limitations of this form of therapy.

Here, in this course, you will be amazed by how far artificial intelligence has advanced nowadays. If I told you last year that you can generate a film and storyboard from just a single text prompt, most likely, you won\u2019t believe that technology actually exists. However, what if I told you that today you actually can utilize AI to generate a film and storyboard with just a single AI prompt describing what you want and in a couple seconds AI can generate the film that you want. That\u2019s exactly what you are going to learn here, in this course, there will be four main projects, the first one is to use AI text to film generator like Vaizz AI, Movie Bot, InVideo, you are going to use those tools to generate a complete film, the second one it to generate a film script using Nolan AI, the third project is to create a storyboard using AI tools like Krock IO and Storyboard That, meanwhile in the fourth project, you are going to create 3D animation film using Deep Motion. In the introduction session, you will learn basic fundamentals of AI text to film generator, such as getting to know its use cases, capabilities, and limitations that you should be aware of. Then continued by learning about storyboarding, especially understanding how it plays an essential role in filmmaking. Afterward you will enter the first project where you will be guided step by step on how to create a film using AI text to film generator tool, Then followed by the second project where you will learn how to generate a complete film script using Nolan AI. Once, we are done with the filmmaking, we will move on to the third project where you will learn step by step on how to generate a storyboard using AI tools like Krock IO, and the project section will be ended with Deep Motion tutorial where you will get to experiment with a lot with 3D avatars and objects to create your own animation videos. Lastly, at the end of the course, you will also learn how to monetise your film content through several business models, such as subscription model, ad revenue, and royalty fees.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, before getting into the course, we need to ask ourselves this question. Why should we learn to create films and storyboards using AI? Well, there are many answers to that question, firstly, utilising AI technology will enable you to automate and speed up your film production process. Can you imagine how long it will take you if you need to record and edit your film manually? It might take a couple weeks or even a couple months. What if I told you that actually you can speed up the process significantly by utilizing AI text to film generators. Not only that, if we are talking from the cost perspective, can you imagine how much budget that you need to spend to hire film editors, animators, script writers, well, it will be a lot of money. Well, the good news here is you will be able to save up most of your budget since you will outsource the vast majority of all your work to artificial intelligence. Other than those two benefits, utilizing AI will also enable you to concentrate on things that are actually more relevant, such as finding new innovations for your next film and implementing the effective promotion strategies to reach as many people as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow are things that you are going to learn from this course:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to generate short film using Vaizz AI\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to generate short film using Movie Bot IO\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to generate short film using Invideo IO\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to create storyboard using StoryboardThat\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to generate content for storyboard using Krock IO\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to generate film script using Nolan AI\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to create 3D animation video using Deep Motion\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn several different ways to monetise your film content through several models, such as ad revenue, licensing, and subscription based model.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/the-future-of-filmmaking-text-to-film-ai-generation/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5543992_5db0.jpg","duration":"2 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"407.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["People who are interested in automating and speeding up film production using AI technologies","People who are interested in creating compelling and interactive storyboard using AI"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":0,"averageValue":"0.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"Christ Raharja","url":"/user/christ-raharja/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":0}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"5F2EC90C7766D1C9E7BD","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/using-powershell-advanced-automated-file-management/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":3676090,"title":"File \u0026 Folder Management Using PowerShell","shortDescription":"Learn File, Folder and Location Management With PowerShell - Practicing Field case examples, Scripts \u0026 Demos","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to learn File Management using PowerShell, then this course is for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFile Management is part of Our day Today IT Operations, After completing this course, You will find yourself very efficient and confident in Advanced Automated File Management.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou will be able to do all the stuff with files and folders using PowerShell, What you can do using normal Graphical User Interface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow a days every Leading Platform using PowerShell as its Management Tool, whether it is Microsoft Products, VMware, Citrix, cloud Providers like Azure, AWS, or Google\u0026nbsp;
