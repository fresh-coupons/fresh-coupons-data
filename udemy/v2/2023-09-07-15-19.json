In the first section, we will introduce linear programming, and we will explore the convexity and types of optimalities. Then, in the second section, we will build up on the basics to learn ways to solve the linear program using the simplex method. We will then explore the concept of linear programming duality. We will also go through some of the hardest-to-understand concepts like strong duality, complementary slackness, and Farkas\u0027 lemma. Furthermore, we try to understand these concepts in an easy-to-follow way. This allows one to obtain lower bounds on the minimization problem and provide proof of optimality or Infeasibility. In the last section, we will explore how to perform sensitivity analysis (the effects of changing parts of a linear program).

I started out my sales career in car sales. I loved it except I was only there to gain sales experience and I had to always be there to make a sale. I treated my car sales job as my college years. I was there 3 years, 10 months before I discovered brokering money. I sell other people\u2019s money to small business owners. I sell the sexiest product in the world. The one thing that 90% of the world is chasing, I am selling. It\u2019s perfect and you can do it from anywhere in the world. This isn\u2019t a get rich quick scheme so if you are looking for one, you\u2019ve picked up the wrong course. You will have to work, but you can easily make 7-6 figures doing this. I am going to help you avoid some of my mistakes and get to where you want to be quicker. Like I said in the beginning, I was a car salesman. I got burned out and had a young daughter and I have always known that I just wanted to learn how to sell then do my own thing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHow do you Broker Money? \u003C/strong\u003EBasically, You are an Independent sales Organization or ISO for short. Your job is to find small business owners who need money for their business, the business can be a start-up, the business can be in different industries. I would advise you to pick a niche. (More on that later) Once you find people who are in need of money you then connect them to our friends (direct lenders) who have money for sale. You make money in the middle. Your don\u2019t have to put up any of your own money to fund businesses. There\u2019s limited risk to you. Our job is to simply find people who need money for business purposes. As long as you can help people solve their money problems, you will never have money problems of your own. You can make money as soon as the Day after you get started. In this industry we can get businesses funding within 24 hours and we get paid from the direct lenders after the business is funded. In this course, you will learn how to find deals, how to sell and have the opportunity to work with me directly. \u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/business-loan-broker-product-knowledge-sales-marketing/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5462204_f50f.jpg","duration":"2 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"2,653.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["This course is for people who are looking for a career change or an opportunity to work for themselves from home.","Real estate professionals and Mortgage lenders do well in our industry","This course is great for people who are in car sales and are trying to get into a new industry","This course is for business bankers that want to work for themselves and provide loans for businesses"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":13,"averageValue":"4.5"},"instructors":[{"name":"Amir Towns","url":"/user/amir-towns-2/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.5384617}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"F1D02EA8516F136AA4D9","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"2 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/data-science-kompakt/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":3203322,"title":"Data Science kompakt","shortDescription":"Kompakte Einf\u00FChrung in Data Mining, Machine Learning und k\u00FCnstliche Intelligenz","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EDer Kurs ist ein Einsteiger-Kurs in die Welt des Data Science, des Machine Learning, der k\u00FCnstlichen Intelligenz und dem Arbeiten mit Daten.

These environments, which combine in-office and remote work, have become the new normal for many organizations. As a result, Human Resources (HR) professionals find themselves facing unique challenges and opportunities in managing a dispersed workforce.

This is a comprehensive project based course where you will learn step by step on how to perform complex analysis and visualisation on real estate market data. This course will be mainly concentrating on forecasting the future housing market using two different forecasting models, those are linear regression and LSTM which stands for long short term memory. Regarding programming language, we are going to use Python alongside several libraries like Pandas for performing data modelling, Numpy for performing complex calculations, Matplotlib for visualising the data, and Scikit-learn for implementing the linear regression model and various evaluation metrics. Whereas, for the data, we are going to download the real estate market dataset from Kaggle. In the introduction session, you will learn basic fundamentals of real estate market forecasting, such as getting to know the characteristics of the real estate market, forecasting models that will be used, and major problems in the real estate market nowadays like limited housing supply and population growth. Then, continue by learning the basic mathematics behind linear regression where you will be guided step by step on how to analyze case study and perform basic linear regression calculation. This session was designed to prepare your knowledge and understanding about linear regression before implementing this concept to your code. Afterward, you will learn several different factors that can potentially impact the real estate market, such as population growth, government policies, and infrastructure development. Once you\u2019ve learnt all necessary knowledge about the real estate market, we will start the forecasting project. Firstly, you will be guided step by step on how to set up Google Colab IDE, then, you will also learn how to find and download datasets from Kaggle. Once everything is all set, you will enter the main section of the course which is the project section. The project will consist of two main parts, the first one is forecasting the real estate market trend using linear regression while the second one is forecasting the real estate market trend using a long short term memory model. Lastly, at the end of the course, you will learn how to evaluate the accuracy and performance of your forecasting models using R-squared and directional symmetry methods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, before getting into the course, we need to ask ourselves these questions: why should we learn to forecast the real estate market? What\u2019s the benefit? Well, I have a ton of answers to those questions. Firstly, the real estate market has always been considered a strong investment option due to its potential for long-term appreciation and income generation. Property values tend to appreciate over time, offering the opportunity for capital gains, while rental income from properties can provide a steady cash flow. Meanwhile, as big data technology has advanced very rapidly in the past few years, integrating this technology to forecast future market trends and prices by identifying patterns in the historical data can be very beneficial as it allows investors to make a data driven investment decision.

We will then go into how IT management and the systemic approach are breaking new ground in finding solutions. Furthermore, we discuss why the word \u0022why\u0022 is essential and look at more examples from the traditional problem solving process.

We will then move on to problem analysis and root cause analysis. For this we will get to know the 5x Why method with some examples. Likewise, we will cover an abstract example of root cause analysis. With the explicit definition of constraints we get approaches to solutions and thus come closer to a solution.

In addition to a brief introduction, we explore the question of what a problem is from a systemic perspective. We go through an example of observing without interpreting, because this is an essential part of objective root cause analysis. Skills such as active listening and problem definition from a systemic perspective are also part of the basic repertoire of this course. In addition, it is about hypothesizing and constantly querying in the systemic loop to approach a problem solution.

By practicing public speaking, you learn how to prepare a message for each type of audience. For example, you would prepare a different speech for a fund-raising dinner than you would for a parent-teacher conference.

For example, if you must interview people for a job opening in your organization, you will get diverse candidates. You must be able to talk with them in person or on the phone and determine whether they have the combination of qualities to succeed in the job. You will have to communicate with them frequently if they join your work organization.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EImportance for Leadership\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of all, public speaking skills are important for leaders. Whether you serve as a president of a civic group or run a small firm, you must communicate with an intent, such as to persuade, to inform or to motivate. You should be able to ask questions, state what your organization needs, represent a position on an issue, respond to other people\u0027s opinions and build consensus.

It varies from person to person, but let\u0027s just say you probably won\u0027t master these in your first few months.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdvanced SEO typically involves technical concepts that are somewhat advanced, and/or a deeper understanding of the workings of Google\u0027s algorithm and are often employed by Professional SEOs. Anyone can master advanced concepts with the right strategic guidance and real life application.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAccording to Griffin, Search engine optimization is the science of improving a website to increase its visibility when people search for products or services. The more visibility a website has on search engines, the more likely it is that brand captures business.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWebsite visibility is commonly measured by the placement -- or ranking -- of the site on search engine results pages (SERPs). And companies always vie for the first page, where they are most likely to garner the most attention.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing Google as an example, SERPs often feature ads at the top of the page. These are positions that businesses are willing to pay for to ensure placement on that first page. Following ads are the regular search listings, which marketers and search engines refer to as organic search results. The SEO process aims to increase a business\u0027s organic search results, driving organic search traffic to the site. This enables data marketers to distinguish between traffic that comes to a website from other channels -- such as paid search, social media, referrals and direct -- and the organic search traffic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrganic search traffic is usually higher-quality traffic because users are actively searching for a specific topic, product or service for which a site might rank. If a user finds that site through the search engine, it can lead to better brand engagement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow does SEO work? While there is a way to maximize results, it is almost impossible to fully manipulate search algorithms. Businesses often look to the shortest path toward ideal results with the least amount of effort, but SEO requires a lot of action and time. There is no SEO strategy where something can be changed today with the expectation of clear results tomorrow. SEO is a long-term project, with daily action and constant activity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch engines use bots to crawl all website pages, downloading and storing that information into a collection known as an index. This index is like a library and when someone searches for something in it, the search engine acts as the librarian. The search engine pulls and displays relevant information from the search query and shows users content related to what they were looking for. Search engine algorithms analyze webpages in the index to determine the order those pages should be displayed on the SERP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe learning objectives of SEO (Search Engine Optimization) encompass various skills and knowledge that enable individuals to effectively optimize websites and content for search engines.
