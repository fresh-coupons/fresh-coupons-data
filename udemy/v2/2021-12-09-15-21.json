Capital, or financing, is needed for the capital investments. A company could generate the capital from internal operations, but often looks for other sources of financing to facilitate faster growth and quicker revenue generation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe options to acquire capital include debt financing and equity financing. As a company thinks about their financing options, they should have an understanding of their financing structure. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is often used for financing decisions. This course will demonstrate the WACC calculation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearners will understand how to calculate the cost of debt. One of the primary forms of debt financing are corporate bonds, the cost including interest payments on the bonds. Taxes have a big impact on financing decisions. Bond interest is generally tax deductible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe will also consider preferred stock financing. In many ways preferred stock is similar to debt financing because of the payments that are somewhat standardized. However, preferred stock does not have a maturity date and the payments are not generally tax deductible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe course will demonstrate common stock financing, a form of equity financing. It can be more difficult to value the cost of common stock financing and we will consider methods in doing so.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"\u0130ngilizce","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/corp-finance-10-cost-of-capitaldebt-equity-financing/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4115694_8f22.jpg","duration":"5 saat","enrolledStudentsCount":"12.545 \u00F6\u011Frenci","lastUpdated":"Son g\u00FCncelleme tarihi: 7/2021","targetAudiences":["Business students","Business professionals"],"tags":["\u0130\u015Fletme","\u0130\u015F Stratejisi","Kurumsal Finans"],"rating":{"count":25,"averageValue":"3.9"},"instructors":[{"name":"Robert (Bob) Steele","url":"/user/c91d6786-95f3-48d8-ab94-cc92431d2aa4/","totalNumberOfStudents":490817,"totalNumberOfReviews":22921,"averageRating":4.437717128981289}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"3CC414E8B68185BF3BFE","originalPrice":"10.240\u00A0\u20B9","discountedPrice":"\u00DCcretsiz","expirationText":"4 g\u00FCn","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-strapi-course-to-create-cms-in-an-easy-way/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4268310,"title":"Complete Strapi Course to create CMS in an easy way","shortDescription":"Using Headless CMS Strapi to build a todo app with React","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy use Strapi?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStrapi is an open-source, Node js-based Headless CMS that\u003Cstrong\u003E saves developers a lot of time while allowing them to use their preferred tools and frameworks\u003C/strong\u003E.

It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy use Python for Machine Learning?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnderstanding Python is one of the valuable skills needed for a career in Machine Learning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough it hasn\u2019t always been, Python is the programming language of choice for data science. Here\u2019s a brief history:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn 2016, it overtook R on Kaggle, the premier platform for data science competitions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn 2017, it overtook R on KDNuggets\u2019s annual poll of data scientists\u2019 most used tools.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn 2018, 66% of data scientists reported using Python daily, making it the number one tool for analytics professionals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMachine Learning experts expect this trend to continue with increasing development in the Python ecosystem. And while your journey to learn Python programming may be just beginning, it\u2019s nice to know that employment opportunities are abundant (and growing) as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy use R for Machine Learning?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnderstanding R is one of the valuable skills needed for a career in Machine Learning. Below are some reasons why you should learn Machine learning in R\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. It\u2019s a popular language for Machine Learning at top tech firms. Almost all of them hire data scientists who use R. Facebook, for example, uses R to do behavioral analysis with user post data. Google uses R to assess ad effectiveness and make economic forecasts. And by the way, it\u2019s not just tech firms: R is in use at analysis and consulting firms, banks and other financial institutions, academic institutions and research labs, and pretty much everywhere else data needs analyzing and visualizing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Learning the data science basics is arguably easier in R. R has a big advantage: it was designed specifically with data manipulation and analysis in mind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Amazing packages that make your life easier. Because R was designed with statistical analysis in mind, it has a fantastic ecosystem of packages and other resources that are great for data science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Robust, growing community of data scientists and statisticians. As the field of data science has exploded, R has exploded with it, becoming one of the fastest-growing languages in the world (as measured by StackOverflow). That means it\u2019s easy to find answers to questions and community guidance as you work your way through projects in R.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Put another tool in your toolkit. No one language is going to be the right tool for every job. Adding R to your repertoire will make some projects easier \u2013 and of course, it\u2019ll also make you a more flexible and marketable employee when you\u2019re looking for jobs in data science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat is the difference between Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPut simply, machine learning and data mining use the same algorithms and techniques as data mining, except the kinds of predictions vary. While data mining discovers previously unknown patterns and knowledge, machine learning reproduces known patterns and knowledge\u2014and further automatically applies that information to data, decision-making, and actions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDeep learning, on the other hand, uses advanced computing power and special types of neural networks and applies them to large amounts of data to learn, understand, and identify complicated patterns.
