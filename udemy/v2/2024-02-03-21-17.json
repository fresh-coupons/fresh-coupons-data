In this master course, we\u0027ll delve into the fundamental concepts of machine learning at a 101 level. Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that empowers computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without explicit programming. Understanding these basics will lay the groundwork for your journey into the vast and ever-evolving field of machine learning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMachine learning is a branch of AI that focuses on creating algorithms and models that can learn from data. Instead of being explicitly programmed to perform specific tasks, machine learning models can identify patterns and relationships in the data and make decisions or predictions based on those patterns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMachine learning has the potential to revolutionize various industries and improve decision-making processes. In this master course, we\u0027ve covered the fundamentals of machine learning at a 101 level, introducing you to key concepts like supervised and unsupervised learning, the machine learning process, and evaluation metrics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETypes of Machine Learning\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are three main types of machine learning:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea) Supervised Learning: In this type, the algorithm learns from labeled data, meaning it\u0027s provided with input-output pairs during the training phase. The goal is for the model to learn a mapping function that can predict the output for unseen inputs accurately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eb) Unsupervised Learning: Unlike supervised learning, unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data. The algorithm\u0027s objective is to find patterns and structures in the data without explicit guidance. Clustering and dimensionality reduction are typical tasks in unsupervised learning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ec) Reinforcement Learning: This type of learning is inspired by behavioral psychology, where an agent interacts with an environment and learns to take actions that maximize rewards or minimize penalties. The agent explores the environment and learns from the feedback it receives.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Machine Learning Process\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe typical machine learning process involves several key steps:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea) Data Collection: Obtaining relevant and high-quality data is crucial for successful machine learning models. The data should be representative of the problem you want to solve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eb) Data Preprocessing: This step involves cleaning the data, handling missing values, and transforming the data into a suitable format for training the models.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ec) Feature Engineering: Selecting and creating relevant features from the data is an essential part of building effective machine learning models. Good features can significantly impact the model\u0027s performance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ed) Model Selection: Choosing an appropriate algorithm or model architecture for the task at hand is essential. The choice of model depends on the problem type (classification, regression, etc.) and the nature of the data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ee) Model Training: In this step, the model is exposed to the training data to learn the underlying patterns and relationships. The algorithm adjusts its parameters to minimize the prediction errors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ef) Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model\u0027s performance on a separate set of data (validation or test set) is essential to ensure it generalizes well to unseen data and avoids overfitting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eg) Model Deployment: After a successful evaluation, the model can be deployed in a real-world setting to make predictions or decisions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEvaluation Metrics\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo assess the performance of a machine learning model, various evaluation metrics are used, depending on the type of problem. For classification tasks, metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are commonly used. For regression tasks, mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) are popular metrics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you continue your journey into the world of machine learning, remember that practice is crucial. Experiment with different datasets, algorithms, and model architectures to gain hands-on experience.

This is an extensive project based course where you will learn step by step on how to build and design an interactive 3D website using Webflow alongside with Spline which is a 3D designing tool. In the introduction session, you will learn the basic fundamentals of Webflow, such as getting to know its main features, common use cases, and I am also going to show you several project showcases created using Webflow. Then, in the next session, you will learn to build 3D models using a tool called Spline, then those 3D models will be integrated to your website later on. After creating several 3D models, we will move on to the project section. Firstly, you will explore all features on the Webflow editing page and you will get to know how to edit the website\u2019s content, upload images, change the design, style, colour etc. Afterward, we will start the actual project. In this course, we will build three websites, the first one is a professional portfolio website, the second one is the product\u0027s landing page, and the third one is a website for restaurants. We will start by adding contents and also optimise the SEO, then, we will integrate 3D models that we created using Spline to the website. In addition to that, we will also animate the website and make it more interactive. Even more exciting, we will build and integrate AI chatbot using Orimon AI. This chatbot will help to answer questions from your website\u0027s visitors. After building the website, we will be conducting testing to make sure that the website functions as it should and also to check if the website has a user friendly interface. There will be four main testing objectives that we are going to be focusing on, those are functionality testing, user experience testing, compatibility testing, and performance testing. Lastly, at the end of the course, we will explore several business models that you can consider, for examples like starting a web design agency, selling Webflow templates, offering SEO service to website owners, selling design assets, and building an E-commerce store for clients.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, before getting into the course, we need to ask ourselves this question, why should we learn to build and design a website using Webflow? Well, there are many reasons and let me explain these two major reasons. Firstly, as the world economy undergoes a digital transformation, an increasing number of businesses are transitioning to online platforms to sell their products and reach a broader customer base. Consequently, there is a growing demand for the creation of high-quality and compelling websites. Secondly, Webflow stands out as a powerful and user-friendly tool that empowers designers and developers to create sophisticated websites without delving into complex code. This accessibility makes it an ideal platform for individuals and businesses seeking to establish a strong online presence without having extensive technical expertise. Last but not least, acquiring the skill of building interactive 3D websites using Webflow will certainly equip you with valuable skill sets and potentially open up a lot business opportunities in the future\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow are things that you can expect to learn from this course:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn the basic fundamentals of Webflow, such as getting to know its main features and use cases\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to build 3D models with Spline\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to edit text, add content, upload images, change background colour, font type, font colour on Webflow editing page\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to integrate 3D models to Webflow\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to animate 3D models on Webflow\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to build a professional portfolio website, product landing page, and restaurant website using Webflow\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to build and integrate AI chatbot to Webflow\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to create online reservation forms using Typeform\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to conduct SEO audit using SEOptimer and Semrush\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to build website using WebWave\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn about website testing objectives, such as functionality testing, user experience testing, compatibility testing, and performance testing\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExplore business models like starting web design agency, selling Webflow templates, offering SEO services, building E-commerce website, and selling design assets\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/building-designing-interactive-3d-websites-with-webflow/","imageUri":"https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5791384_4939_2.jpg","duration":"2.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"1,723.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["People who are interested in building interactive 3D websites using Webflow","People who are interested in animating 3D models"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":0,"averageValue":"0.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"Christ Raharja","url":"/user/christ-raharja/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":0}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"63603807CA99C8C9EE62","originalPrice":"\u20B93,499","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"3 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/gas-station-petrol-station-management-filling-station-management/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5415066,"title":"Master Course in Gas Station \u0026 Petrol Station Management 2.0","shortDescription":"Gas Station Management, Filling station Management,Petrol Station Management,Petrol Bunk Management,Oil and Gas Industry","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMaster Course in Gas Station \u0026amp; Petrol Station Management 2.0\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EManaging a gas station involves much more than just pumping gas and collecting payments.
