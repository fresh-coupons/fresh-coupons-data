Includes JSX, Callbacks, Events, \u002B More","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EThis course takes you step-by-step through the process of building a fully functional calculator in React. React, also known as React JS, is a powerful JavaScript library used for building custom, interactive user interfaces using UI components. Some of the most well known examples of organizations using React for their front-end include Netflix, Facebook, and Airbnb. Developed and maintained by Meta along with a community of independent developers, React remains free and open-source. React is a component based library built entirely on JavaScript, which makes it perfect for designing complex UI\u2019s. With React, developers can build encapsulated components that efficiently manage their own state and render UI updates specifically when data changes. For example, think of the automated content refresh feature you see on a twitter feed, or facebook like button. Here the state of the UI component changes on the page, without having to manually refresh when the data is updated. This is just one small, yet powerful feature of React.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThrough a complete hands-on project, this course will teach you all the fundamental principles of React that you must know to become a proficient React developer. We start right from the basics, including the tools needed to get started. From there we dive into JSX, functional components, props, callbacks, and various OnClick events. By this stage, the calculator will have a complete visual display, coupled with functional arithmetic operations. Students then move on to passing parameters in Callback functions, using the React State Hook, and debugging.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn addition to the hands-on React module, we also offer a comprehensive overview of JavaScript for those who need a refresher. Here we start with introducing students to the document object model (DOM) which defines the logical structure of HTML documents. From there we dive into JavaScript to demonstrate various methods in which DOM elements can be manipulated to add interactivity to static components. We start right from the basics, which includes JavaScript placement, and data output. From there we move on to variable declaration, arithmetic operations, operator precedence, data types, and objects. Once the foundations are covered, we move on to more complex operations using Arrays, Conditional Statements, JavaScript comparison operators, booleans and loops. Here students will learn to unleash the true power of JavaScript to render different outcomes based on user interaction. We will explore the use of functions to efficiently handle repetitive tasks and JavaScript events to handle output based on actions and occurrences. The section will conclude with a hands-on project where students will implement their knowledge to build a web based photo gallery and background color changer. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAs you can see this course covers a tremendous bit of ground. Best of all it features Tim Maclachlan - a renowned senior full-stack developer with over 20 years of commercial development experience.

The Google Ads platform focuses on Pay Per Click (PPC) ads, where advertisers pay per impression on an ad.

This course offers a comprehensive guide into one of the most powerful, modern JavaScript libraries available - ReactJS. Whether you are completely new to React, or you\u2019ve dabbled with it in the past, one thing\u2019s for sure - You\u2019ve likely interacted with a number of web applications that use the React library for building out user interface components. Some of the most well known examples include Netflix, Facebook, and Airbnb. Developed and maintained by Meta along with a community of independent developers, React remains free and open-source. React is a component based library built entirely on JavaScript, which makes it perfect for designing complex UI\u2019s. With React, developers can build encapsulated components that efficiently manage their own state and render UI updates specifically when data changes. For example, think of the automated content refresh feature you see on a twitter feed, or Facebook like button. Here, the state of the UI component changes on the page without having to manually refresh when the data is updated. This is just one small, yet powerful UI feature built into React.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThis course starts with exploring the foundations of React and its core use cases.

The focus of the course will be on four key services, including: Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), AWS Storage Solutions, and Elastic Load Balancers (ELB) integrated with Auto Scaling Groups (ASG). \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAmazon EC2 is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It allows users to launch virtual machines (VMs) on demand and pay only for the compute resources they use. In this course, we will explore the different types of instances available, as well as how to launch, configure, and manage EC2 instances.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn addition to the EC2 service, we also explore AWS storage solutions including Elastic Block Store (EBS), Elastic File System (EFS), Snapshots, and Amazon Machine Images (AMIs). EBS is a block-level storage service for use with EC2 instances. It provides persistent storage for data that needs to be frequently accessed. EFS is a file-level storage service for use with EC2 instances. It allows users to create and configure file systems that can be accessed from multiple instances. Snapshots are point-in-time copies of EBS volumes that can be used for backup and recovery. AMIs are pre-configured virtual machine images that can be used to launch EC2 instances. In this course, we will explore the different storage options available and how to use them to manage data on the AWS platform.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOnce students have a handle on the foundations, we explore more intermediate topics relevant to workload distribution through the integration of ELBs and ASGs. Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs) are used to distribute incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances. They automatically scale to handle incoming traffic and can also be used to improve availability and fault tolerance. In this course, we will explore the different types of load balancers available, as well as how to configure and use them to distribute traffic across multiple instances.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWe will demonstrate how to integrate the ELBs with Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs) to ensure workloads are only distributed to healthy nodes within the EC2 service. ASGs allow users to automatically scale the number of EC2 instances in response to changing demand. They automatically launch and terminate instances based on predefined rules, ensuring that the number of instances is always sufficient to handle incoming traffic.

Maar als je slim belegt, kan je gemiddeld wel 10% rendement behalen!

Dat maakt je een miljonair. Als je op je 40e begint met 100.000 euro, kan je ook miljonair worden na 24 jaar op je 64e. Als je dit via een fonds/bank doet zoals ABN/MeesPierson dan betaal je bijv 1.39% per jaar aan kosten. Over 50jaar tijd betekend dit dat je de HELFT van minder over houdt. Die 10.000,- wordt dan geen 1 miljoen, maar enkel 500.000,-. Deze cursus kan je dus met gemak een half miljoen besparen! Klinkt te mooi om waar te zijn? 10% is het gemiddelde langdurige rendement per jaar van aandelen.

Asynchronous patterns are used extensively. This course will take you from a beginner or intermediate level to \u003Cstrong\u003Emastering asynchronous JavaScript\u003C/strong\u003E. You will feel comfortable dealing with any asynchronous code.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis course start with the basics of asynchronous coding in JavaScript. We take a look at the \u003Cstrong\u003Eevent loop\u003C/strong\u003E and the role it plays in asynchronous JavaScript.

Here\u0027s why Mini MBA programs are important for building careers and businesses:","1. Skill Enhancement: Mini MBA programs provide participants with a comprehensive understanding of key business principles, such as finance, marketing, strategy, and leadership. This knowledge equips individuals with the skills necessary to excel in their current roles or transition into new ones. Employers can benefit from employees who possess a broader skill set and can contribute more effectively to the organization\u0027s success.","2. Cost-Effective: Mini MBA programs are typically more affordable than full-length MBA programs, making them accessible to a wider range of professionals. This affordability allows individuals to invest in their education without incurring substantial debt, making it a viable option for those looking to advance their careers or start their own businesses.","3. Time Efficiency: Many professionals cannot commit to the two-year duration of a traditional MBA program due to work and personal commitments. Mini MBA programs are designed to be completed in a shorter time frame, often a few months, making it possible for individuals to balance their education with their existing responsibilities.","4. Networking Opportunities: Mini MBA programs often bring together a diverse group of professionals from various industries and backgrounds. This diversity fosters valuable networking opportunities, enabling participants to connect with peers, instructors, and industry experts. Building a strong professional network can open doors to new career opportunities and potential business collaborations.","5. Entrepreneurial Skill Development: Mini MBA programs are particularly beneficial for aspiring entrepreneurs. They offer insights into business planning, finance, marketing, and strategy \u2013 all critical aspects of launching and running a successful business. Entrepreneurs can use the knowledge gained from a Mini MBA program to make informed decisions and navigate the complexities of entrepreneurship.","6. Adaptability and Continuous Learning: In today\u0027s rapidly changing business landscape, adaptability and continuous learning are essential. Mini MBA programs provide participants with up-to-date knowledge and skills that can help them stay relevant and competitive in their careers. Employers value employees who are committed to ongoing learning and development.","7. Career Advancement: For employees looking to advance within their organizations, a Mini MBA can be a valuable asset. It demonstrates a commitment to professional growth and can make individuals more competitive for promotions and leadership positions.","8. Confidence Building: Mini MBA programs can boost the confidence of both employees and aspiring entrepreneurs. Knowing that you have a solid foundation in business concepts and strategies can empower you to take on new challenges and seize opportunities.","Mini MBA programs offer a cost-effective, time-efficient, and comprehensive way for both employers and experts to enhance their skills, advance their careers, and build successful businesses. Whether you are seeking career growth within an organization or aiming to launch your own venture, a Mini MBA program can provide the knowledge and confidence needed to achieve your goals in the dynamic world of business."],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":138,"averageValue":"4.2"},"instructors":[{"name":"MTF Institute of Management, Technology and Finance","url":"/user/mtfinstitute/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.2530866}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"C21DE1631157EC034548","originalPrice":"\u20B93,499","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"3 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/filmora9-complete-video-editing-tutorial-for-beginners-2020/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":3209379,"title":"Filmora 11/X/9:  Zero to Hero in Video Editing","shortDescription":"Learn Video Editing Like A Pro Using Wondershare Filmora X and  Filmora 9 Zero To Hero With These Step By Step Tutorial.","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWho Is This For?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis course was made for YouTubers, filmmakers, Vloggers, professional video editors, who want to edit for others like freelance.

Below are some reasons why you should learn Machine learning in R\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\t1. It\u2019s a popular language for Machine Learning at top tech firms. Almost all of them hire data scientists who use R. Facebook, for example, uses R to do behavioral analysis with user post data. Google uses R to assess ad effectiveness and make economic forecasts. And by the way, it\u2019s not just tech firms: R is in use at analysis and consulting firms, banks and other financial institutions, academic institutions and research labs, and pretty much everywhere else data needs analyzing and visualizing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\t2. Learning the data science basics is arguably easier in R. R has a big advantage: it was designed specifically with data manipulation and analysis in mind. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\t3. Amazing packages that make your life easier. Because R was designed with statistical analysis in mind, it has a fantastic ecosystem of packages and other resources that are great for data science. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\t4. Robust, growing community of data scientists and statisticians. As the field of data science has exploded, R has exploded with it, becoming one of the fastest-growing languages in the world (as measured by StackOverflow). That means it\u2019s easy to find answers to questions and community guidance as you work your way through projects in R.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\t5. Put another tool in your toolkit. No one language is going to be the right tool for every job. Adding R to your repertoire will make some projects easier \u2013 and of course, it\u2019ll also make you a more flexible and marketable employee when you\u2019re looking for jobs in data science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat is the difference between Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPut simply, machine learning and data mining use the same algorithms and techniques as data mining, except the kinds of predictions vary. While data mining discovers previously unknown patterns and knowledge, machine learning reproduces known patterns and knowledge\u2014and further automatically applies that information to data, decision-making, and actions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDeep learning, on the other hand, uses advanced computing power and special types of neural networks and applies them to large amounts of data to learn, understand, and identify complicated patterns.
