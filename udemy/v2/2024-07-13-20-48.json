Their role is actually quite simple. They help us answer three questions: What do I want to change about myself, How do I change,\u0026nbsp; How do I commit to changing, Whether it\u2019s being a better lawyer, a leader or manager or whether it\u2019s more personal, such as getting in shape, losing weight, being a better parent, change starts with identifying what you want to change about yourself, figuring out how to get from here to there and making that change a reality. Life coaches help you do this. They help you to get to know yourself better, define what you really want and work with you on how to get it. Successful individuals set goals and pursue them. When we feel stuck, we\u2019re in a rut, or we find ourselves asking, How did I get here? we know we need to make a change, but we have difficulty defining the change and have less of an idea of how to make it.\u0026nbsp; life coach helps you answer these questions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA life coach can lead you to water but can\u2019t make you drink.

Your life coach can offer advice, motivation and inspiration but you\u2019re the one on the field. You\u2019re the one running and hustling, blocking and tackling, throwing and receiving, making the moves and making the plays. In short, a life coach is just that a coach\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea life coach helps you figure things out, but once you havea strategy, it\u2019s up to you to execute. he\u2019s not there to hold your hand or carry you across the finish line. he helps you be the brains of the operation. good life coach has a process for you to follow to determine what you want to change, how to change it and how to stick with it through the end.

Special attention is also given to SMED (Single-Minute Exchange of Die) and TPM (Total Productive Maintenance) methods, vital to increasing machine productivity and reliability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe course also discusses methods for identifying and eliminating waste and the principles of Kaizen, or continuous improvement. Participants will learn how to implement a Lean culture in their organization, how to measure the effects of Lean implementation, and how to maintain and develop a Lean culture in the long term.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy engaging in practical exercises and studying real-world examples, participants will be equipped to directly apply the knowledge gained in their organizations. This will enable them to make significant strides in improving their operational efficiency and competitiveness in the market.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/lean-manufacturing-from-beginning-to-expert/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5976400_ce30_3.jpg","duration":"9 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"2,998.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Employees of companies who want to improve business operations, regardless of their position.","Business owners and department managers who want to increase the operational efficiency of their teams.","Individuals who want to improve their skills in business process improvement, a skill that is highly sought after on the job market.","Managers at any management level - new and experienced aspiring managers, especially those operating in operational, manufacturing, or service sectors.","Ambitious independent workers want to have a more significant impact on their work and the implementation of change and want to be noticed.","Supervisors, consultants, engineers, planners, analysts, management teams, and leaders.","Individuals working in manufacturing, industry, and other areas where process optimization is critical.","Practitioners of Lean, continuous improvement (CI), and Kaizen teams seek new inspiration and tools to implement change more effectively.","Individuals who want to become an authority on business process improvement in their workplace.","Six Sigma belt holders (white, yellow, green, black) who want to supplement their knowledge of Lean methodology to make improvements even more effective.","1This guide is for anyone looking for effective ways to improve their organization\u0027s efficiency, productivity, and quality of work and for those who want to make valuable changes and contribute to the company\u0027s sustainability."],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":18,"averageValue":"4.9"},"instructors":[{"name":"Jan Sabat","url":"/user/sabat-consulting-sc/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.875}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"FFC660A67B87CA90BF6F","originalPrice":"\u20B91,799","discountedPrice":"\u20B9449","expirationText":"5 hours","discountPercentage":75}}},"freeCourses":{}}
