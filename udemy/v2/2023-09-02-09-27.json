The training program will help the trainee to perform all the statistical analysis with Minitab. It is also intended to make the trainees cover all the topics that fall under the domain of Minitab. Topics like Minitab GUI and Descriptive Statistics, Statistical Analysis using Minitab, Correlation Techniques in Minitab and Predictive Modeling using Excel will be covered in this training module and Project on Data Analytics using Minitab and Project on Minitab \u2013 Regression Modeling will be covered in the project module. The goal of this course is to help an individual to achieve knowledge of working with Minitab to perform time series analysis and forecasting of data in all sorts of statistics based problems. It will help all the interested trainees who are willing to extend their knowledge base concerned with Data analytics. This training will also assist the trainees to understand the sort of problems that could be resolved using this. After the finishing of the course, the trainee will advance with the skills needed for time series analysis and forecasting of data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo understand the meaning of the \u201Cname\u201D of the course, let us break down the curse and understand them word by word so that the intent of the course would be clear to our learners and we would set an expectation for our learners who would be pursuing the course. Let us start to understand what Minitab is. Minitab is a software used in use cases of statistics. Minitab, as the software is capable of data analysis, pattern detection through statistics, data crunching. Most of the calculation is automated, and graphs are generated as per the functionality required by the analyst working on the use cases. For this course specifically, we would be exploiting the use of Minitab for Time Series Analysis and Forecasting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, let us understand what time series analysis is. Time series data is a collection of data over some time or interval. The data when captured over time typically might have some internal structure, for example, autocorrelation, trends, seasonality, stationarity, and many such fundamentals. For example, let us think about the sales of umbrellas or raincoats. We can see that in the selling of these items we might encounter a seasonality aspect, that they might be sold high during the onset of the rainy season. Also, we can see that the data itself might auto-correlate itself to the promos that might have been set by some stores, online or offline, and many more such intricate detailing through the understanding of time series analysis fundamentals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow when we know how to analyze the time series it becomes pretty evident that what exactly to do with the studies or hypothesis we developed as a part of the study. The answer lies in prediction! We would understand the fundamentals through historical time series data and then utilize that deep insight to predict or forecast for the future. In this way, we would be able to capture the historical trends and seasonality and utilize them to have a better insight into what\u2019s in store in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis course is a collection of well-crafted tutorials or topics we would naturally go about if we must fully understand the topic of time series analysis and forecasting. This course will allow you to get a sense of what is lying in the basket of time series analysis in the professional project which you would encounter as soon as you take up the project in your organization. This course makes you reach that level of being the \u201Chandful\u201D of people who are capable of cracking even the toughest nut in the professional world.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis confidence you build in the course of this training will go a long way in not only analyzing the sense of time series data but also give you the capability to mentor people who would have just started their track on time series analysis. This course doesn\u2019t differentiate between a beginner or an advanced learner. We have to learn for everyone who is here to expand their horizon of knowledge. Lastly, we would like to mention that this course will lay a strong foundation in time series analysis so that you would be able to build a strong mansion on this foundation layer.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/predictive-modeling-and-time-series-analysis-with-minitab/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4722578_a844_3.jpg","duration":"2.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"6,908.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["We start everything from scratch and try to build from there and the only thing we require is a sense of perseverance and full dedication towards the course.

Two fundamental principles of Islamic banking are the sharing of profit and loss and the prohibition of the collection and payment of interest by lenders and investors. In Islamic banking, the banks do not collect interests from creditors. Instead, they earn money using equity participation systems and share profits and losses. Islamic finance is practiced in many Muslim countries and is extremely popular among Islamic communities, as some conventional banking practices might be against Shariah. Islamic finance is considered more ethical than conventional banking, as it believes that a bank and its clients should make profits and losses together. Hence, it does not just focus on maximizing the bank\u2019s wealth. Also, Islamic finance practices consider the best interests of the Muslim community.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIslamic banking development can be attributed to some conventional banking theories and practices which go against and hurt the sentiments of the Muslim communities. Hence, Islamic finance was developed by inventing methods that are Sharia-compliant. Sharia is the Islamic law present in the Quran\u2019s teachings. Creating practices that align with the Muslim culture and beliefs encourages many to take up banking. Islamic finance is so strictly followed that banks look to religious leaders and scholars for guidance.

It assumes that you\u0027re new to the language, so it gets you started with basic functionality such as creating functions, creating variables, and calling these lines of code from your standard HTML pages. It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables.

The user inputs the string through an HTML form and the result is displayed on the page, styled with CSS. The project uses a recursive function to check if the string is a palindrome. The function starts at the beginning and end of the string and compares the characters at each index. If the characters are the same, the function continues to the next index. If the characters are not the same, the function returns false.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERGB Color Generator:\u003C/strong\u003E This project generates random RGB (red, green, blue) color values using JavaScript. The generated color is displayed on an HTML page, with the background color changing to the generated color. The page can be styled with CSS. The project uses the Math. random() function to generate random numbers between 0 and 255. The three random numbers are used to create an RGB color value. The color value is then used to change the background color of the page.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECounter Application:\u003C/strong\u003E This project is a simple counter application that uses JavaScript to increment and decrement a count value. The count value is displayed on an HTML page and buttons can be added to increment and decrement the count. The page can be styled with CSS. The project uses two variables to store the count value and the button click event handlers to increment and decrement the count value. The count value is then displayed on the page.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EASCII and Unicode Character Detector:\u003C/strong\u003E This project uses JavaScript to detect whether a given character is an ASCII or Unicode character. The user inputs the character through an HTML form and the result is displayed on the page, styled with CSS. The project uses the String.fromCharCode() function to convert the character to a string. The charCodeAt() function is then used to get the ASCII code of the character. If the ASCII code is between 0 and 127, the character is an ASCII character. Otherwise, the character is a Unicode character.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAnalog Clock Application:\u003C/strong\u003E This project displays an analog clock with the current time on an HTML page using JavaScript. The clock is created using CSS to style the clock\u0027s face and hands. The project uses the Date() object to get the current time. The current time is then used to set the position of the clock\u0027s hands.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERandom Color Generator:\u003C/strong\u003E This project generates random colors in any format (e.g. RGB, HEX, HSL) using JavaScript.

Did you build a couple of projects with PHP and MySQL, but you still think you are inexperienced and you are missing out on a lot of things when coming to developing bigger projects? If yes, then this course is the right resource for you. This course is very digestible and informative and it was created specifically to enhance your coding skills and knowledge not just in PHP and MySQL, but overall in developing web projects. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is what we are going to do in this course. Naturally, we are going to get started by setting up the right tools for our projects. And after that, we are going to build our first simple yet very interesting project and that\u0027s a payment page with Paypal. The second project will be about a simple forum system. They are going to be also a couple of generic projects like the full CRUD\u0026nbsp;app and so on. After this, the next project will be the starting of something big because it\u0027s an authentication system where I am going to teach you how to develop a login and a register page, how to hash and de-hash passwords, how to do validation and so much more. After this, we are going to build a comments system and this will be the biggest project in this course. We will begin first by doing a post system and then we will grab comments for every post that we have of course we will use Ajax-JQuery for inserting, deleting, and showing comments. after that, we will integrate a rating system into the previous two projects to make a bigger project. So, I will show how to download a JQuery plugin, how to integrate it and how to use it to do the rating system for every post, and so on. And the rating system is going to be implemented of course using Ajax-JQuery. The upcoming project is going to be also created with Ajax and JQuery and that\u0027s a live search system and we will combine it with our big project. There are a lot of projects along the way but it\u0027s going to take a very long time to talk about them. So I will let you discover the many benefits of this course.
