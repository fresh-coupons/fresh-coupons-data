By making \u003Cstrong\u003Emachine learning\u003C/strong\u003E playful, we help young learners see \u003Cstrong\u003Etechnology not just as magic, but as something they can understand and create with\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the biggest strengths of this course is its balance of \u003Cstrong\u003Eeducation and fun\u003C/strong\u003E. Kids will learn how \u003Cstrong\u003EAI in games\u003C/strong\u003E makes characters smarter, how \u003Cstrong\u003Erobots with AI brains\u003C/strong\u003E follow instructions, and how \u003Cstrong\u003Ecomputer vision\u003C/strong\u003E allows machines to \u201Csee\u201D the world through cameras. They\u2019ll also try out activities like designing their own \u003Cstrong\u003EAI buddy\u003C/strong\u003E, talking to a \u003Cstrong\u003Echatbot\u003C/strong\u003E, and creating silly stories with \u003Cstrong\u003EAI writing tools\u003C/strong\u003E. Every lesson is filled with storytelling, examples from kid-friendly favorites like Pok\u00E9mon, Minecraft, and WALL-E, and plenty of laughter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EParents will love that this course goes beyond entertainment\u2014it builds \u003Cstrong\u003Ecritical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving skills\u003C/strong\u003E. By understanding both the \u003Cstrong\u003Ebenefits of AI\u003C/strong\u003E and its \u003Cstrong\u003Eresponsibilities\u003C/strong\u003E, kids gain an early awareness of how technology shapes our world. We emphasize that \u003Cstrong\u003EAI is a tool, not a replacement for humans\u003C/strong\u003E, and that kids themselves can be \u003Cstrong\u003Efuture AI creators\u003C/strong\u003E. Whether your child dreams of being a game designer, a scientist, an artist, or just wants to explore how the apps they use every day really work, this course provides a safe and inspiring starting point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the end of the program, students will be able to explain what \u003Cstrong\u003Eartificial intelligence\u003C/strong\u003E is, identify examples of \u003Cstrong\u003EAI in daily life\u003C/strong\u003E, and imagine their own future projects powered by technology. They\u2019ll see themselves not only as users of apps and devices, but as potential \u003Cstrong\u003Einnovators, builders, and problem-solvers\u003C/strong\u003E in a world where \u003Cstrong\u003EAI is everywhere\u003C/strong\u003E. This course lights a spark of curiosity that may grow into a lifelong passion for \u003Cstrong\u003ESTEM, coding, and digital creativity\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want your child to gain confidence, develop digital skills, and join the next generation of \u003Cstrong\u003EAI explorers\u003C/strong\u003E, then this course is the perfect first step. \u003Cstrong\u003EAI made simple, AI made fun, AI made for kids\u003C/strong\u003E\u2014it\u2019s time to let their imagination meet the future of technology.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/ai-made-simple-for-kids/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/6828565_ce1d.jpg","duration":"2.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"916.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Kids ages 8\u201312 who are curious about technology, games, and how AI works.","Children who enjoy creative activities like drawing, storytelling, or designing and want to see how AI can bring their ideas to life.","Parents looking for a safe, fun, and age-appropriate way to introduce their kids to artificial intelligence and STEM skills.","Teachers or homeschooling families who want an engaging, beginner-friendly supplement to STEM and computer science education.","Kids who already use AI in daily life (YouTube, Alexa, Siri, Netflix) and want to understand how it actually works.","Future creators, innovators, and problem-solvers who want to explore AI through fun games, activities, and projects."],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":0,"averageValue":"0.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"School of AI","url":"/user/school-of-ai/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":0}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"173004F2843A6DB5C76B","originalPrice":"\u20B92,059","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"3 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/7-day-mindset-reset-for-women-students/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":6770335,"title":"7 Day Mindset Reset For (Women) Students","shortDescription":"Helping women students move from overwhelm to clarity with 5\u201310-minute tools","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFeel Stuck?

In this module, you will learn how to publish your app to the Google Play Store. You will also explore strategies for app monetization, including in-app purchases\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven though Kotlin is a full-fledged functional programming language, it preserves most of the object-oriented nature of Java as an alternative programming style, which is very handy when converting existing Java code. Kotlin has classes with constructors, along with nested, inner, and anonymous inner classes, and it has interfaces like Java 8. Kotlin does \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E have a new keyword. To create a class instance, call the constructor just like a regular function. We saw that in the screenshot above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKotlin has single inheritance from a named superclass, and all Kotlin classes have a default superclass Any, which is \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E the same as the Java base class java.lang.Object. Any contains only three predefined member functions: equals(), hashCode(), and toString().\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKotlin classes have to be marked with the open keyword in order to allow other classes to inherit from them; Java classes are kind of the opposite, as they are inheritable \u003Cem\u003Eunless\u003C/em\u003E marked with the final keyword. To override a superclass method, the method itself must be marked open, and the subclass method must be marked override. This is all of a piece with Kotlin\u2019s philosophy of making things explicit rather than relying on defaults. In this particular case, I can see where Kotlin\u2019s way of explicitly marking base class members as open for inheritance and derived class members as overrides avoids several kinds of common Java errors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, you\u0027ll learn how to create apps and run them on virtual devices through guided exercises. You\u0027ll cover the fundamentals of Android development, from structuring an app to building out the UI with Activities and Fragments and various navigation patterns. Progressing through the chapters and lectures, you\u0027ll delve into Android\u0027s RecyclerView to make the most of displaying lists of data and become comfortable with fetching data from a web service and handling images. You\u0027ll then learn about mapping, location services, and the permissions model before working with notifications and how to persist data. Moving on, you\u0027ll get to grips with testing, covering the full spectrum of the test pyramid. You\u0027ll also learn how AAC (Android Architecture Components) are used to cleanly structure your code and explore various architecture patterns and the benefits of dependency injection. \u003Cem\u003EThe core libraries of RxJava and Coroutines are covered for asynchronous programming\u003C/em\u003E. The focus then returns to the UI, demonstrating how to add motion and transitions when users interact with your apps. Towards the end, you\u0027ll build an interesting app to retrieve and display popular movies from a movie database, and then see how to publish your apps on Google Play. By the end of this course, you\u0027ll have the skills and confidence needed to build fully-fledged Android apps using Kotlin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre you trying to start a career in Android programming, but haven\u0027t found the right way in? Do you have a great idea for an app, but don\u0027t know how to make it a reality? Or maybe you\u0027re just frustrated that to learn Android, you must already know Kotlin. If so, then this course is for you\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen Android first arrived in 2008, it was a bit drab compared to the much more stylish iOS on the Apple iPhone/iPad. But, quite quickly, through a variety of handset offers that struck a chord with practical, price-conscious consumers, as well as those who are fashion-conscious and tech-savvy, Android user numbers exploded. For many, myself included, developing for Android is the most rewarding pastime and business, bar none. Quickly putting together a prototype of an idea, refining it, and then deciding to run with it and wire it up into a fully-fledged app, is such an exciting and rewarding process. Any programming can be fun \u2013 I have been programming all my life \u2013 but creating for Android is somehow extraordinarily rewarding..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKotlin is the most succinct language, and therefore is the least error-prone, \u003Cem\u003Ewhich is great for beginners\u003C/em\u003E. Kotlin is also the most fun language, mainly because the succinctness means you can get results faster and with less code. Google considers Kotlin an official (first-class) Android language. There are some other advantages to Kotlin that make it less error-prone and less likely to make mistakes that cause crashes. We will discover the details of these advantages as we proceed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKotlin is an object-oriented language. This means that it uses the concept of reusable programming objects. If this sounds like technical jargon, another analogy will help. Kotlin enables us and others (like the Android API development team) to write code that can be structured based on real-world things, and here is the important part \u2013 it can be reused.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/kotlin-android-training-android-app-development/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4365954_c92d_6.jpg","duration":"15.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"114,843.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Beginner Kotlin Developers","Android Kotlin Programming Training","Mobile App Development Course"],"tags":["Android Development","Kotlin"],"rating":{"count":755,"averageValue":"4.4"},"instructors":[{"name":"OCSALY Academy | 500.000\u002B Students","url":"/user/online-academy-of-computer-science/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.298387}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"ANDROID-5_STAR","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/computer-forensics-and-digital-forensics-for-everyone/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5023282,"title":"Computer Forensics and Digital Forensics Masterclass PRO\u002B","shortDescription":"Learn computer forensics, digital forensics, mobile forensics, windows forensics, linux forensics and other forensics.","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EThis is the \u003Cstrong\u003Emost comprehensive, yet straight-forward, course for the Digital Forensics and Computer Forensics on Udemy!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E*Get the Official Certificate after Completing the Course\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis course is intended for anyone who wants to learn the basics of digital forensics and computer forensics.

The goal of computer forensics is to perform a structured investigation and maintain a documented chain of evidence to find out exactly what happened on a computing device and who was responsible for it. Computer forensics -- which is sometimes referred to as computer forensic science essentially is data recovery with legal compliance guidelines to make the information admissible in legal proceedings. The terms digital forensics and cyber forensics are often used as synonyms for computer forensics. Digital forensics starts with the collection of information in a way that maintains its integrity. Investigators then analyze the data or system to determine if it was changed, how it was changed and who made the changes. The use of computer forensics isn\u0027t always tied to a crime. The forensic process is also used as part of data recovery processes to gather data from a crashed server, failed drive, reformatted operating system (OS) or other situation where a system has unexpectedly stopped working.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy is computer forensics important?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the civil and criminal justice system, computer forensics helps ensure the integrity of digital evidence presented in court cases.

Either you are preparing yourself to enter into the field of automotive service, or you are expanding your skills to include automotive electrical systems. In either case, congratulations on selecting one of the most fast-paced segments of the automotive industry. Working with the electrical systems can be challenging, yet very rewarding; however, it can also be very frustrating at times. For many people, learning electrical systems can be a struggle. It is my hope that I am able to present the course to you in such a manner that you will not only understand electrical systems, but will excel at it. There are many ways the theory of electricity can be explained, and many metaphors can be used. Some compare electricity to a water flow, while others explain it in a purely scientific fashion. Everyone learns differently. I am presenting electrical theory in a manner that I hope will be clear and concise. If you do not fully comprehend a concept, then it is important to discuss it with your instructor.

They would specialize in engines, steering/ suspension, or brakes. Today, there is not a system on the vehicle that is immune to the role of electrical circuits. Engine controls, electronic suspension systems, and anti-lock brakes are common on today\u2019s vehicles. Even electrical systems that were once thought of as being simple have evolved to computer controls. Headlights are now pulse-width modulated using high side drivers and will automatically brighten and dim based on the light intensity of oncoming traffic. Today\u2019s vehicles are equipped with twenty or more computers, laser-guided cruise control, sonar park assist, infrared climate control, fiber optics, and radio frequency transponders and decoders. Simple systems have become more computers reliant. For example, the horn circuit on the 2008 Chrysler 300C involves three separate control modules to function. Even the tires have computers involved, with the addition of tire pressure monitoring systems!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday\u2019s technician must possess a full and complete electrical background to be able to succeed.

Whenever they dismantle something, they can reassemble it how it was. Whenever they say that they need to investigate the hood, they can really get the darn thing open.
