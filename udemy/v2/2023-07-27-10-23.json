MapReduce comprises of two things that work consecutively to process the analytics. The process in both the different parts is done in a parallel manner helping save a lot of time while working with significant data.

The dataset gets divided equally among different mappers and all of the processes or analyses the data in a parallel manner.

The role of the reducer is to collect the data from all the mappers and then process their outcome to get the final result.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor instance, if Flipkart needs to find out the total sell in 2018 in Mumbai.

The training program will help the trainee to perform all the statistical analysis with Minitab. It is also intended to make the trainees cover all the topics that fall under the domain of Minitab. Topics like Minitab GUI and Descriptive Statistics, Statistical Analysis using Minitab, Correlation Techniques in Minitab and Predictive Modeling using Excel will be covered in this training module and Project on Data Analytics using Minitab and Project on Minitab \u2013 Regression Modeling will be covered in the project module. The goal of this course is to help an individual to achieve knowledge of working with Minitab to perform time series analysis and forecasting of data in all sorts of statistics based problems. It will help all the interested trainees who are willing to extend their knowledge base concerned with Data analytics. This training will also assist the trainees to understand the sort of problems that could be resolved using this.

Let us start to understand what Minitab is. Minitab is a software used in use cases of statistics. Minitab, as the software is capable of data analysis, pattern detection through statistics, data crunching. Most of the calculation is automated, and graphs are generated as per the functionality required by the analyst working on the use cases. For this course specifically, we would be exploiting the use of Minitab for Time Series Analysis and Forecasting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, let us understand what time series analysis is. Time series data is a collection of data over some time or interval. The data when captured over time typically might have some internal structure, for example, autocorrelation, trends, seasonality, stationarity, and many such fundamentals. For example, let us think about the sales of umbrellas or raincoats. We can see that in the selling of these items we might encounter a seasonality aspect, that they might be sold high during the onset of the rainy season. Also, we can see that the data itself might auto-correlate itself to the promos that might have been set by some stores, online or offline, and many more such intricate detailing through the understanding of time series analysis fundamentals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow when we know how to analyze the time series it becomes pretty evident that what exactly to do with the studies or hypothesis we developed as a part of the study. The answer lies in prediction! We would understand the fundamentals through historical time series data and then utilize that deep insight to predict or forecast for the future. In this way, we would be able to capture the historical trends and seasonality and utilize them to have a better insight into what\u2019s in store in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis course is a collection of well-crafted tutorials or topics we would naturally go about if we must fully understand the topic of time series analysis and forecasting. This course will allow you to get a sense of what is lying in the basket of time series analysis in the professional project which you would encounter as soon as you take up the project in your organization. This course makes you reach that level of being the \u201Chandful\u201D of people who are capable of cracking even the toughest nut in the professional world.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis confidence you build in the course of this training will go a long way in not only analyzing the sense of time series data but also give you the capability to mentor people who would have just started their track on time series analysis. This course doesn\u2019t differentiate between a beginner or an advanced learner. We have to learn for everyone who is here to expand their horizon of knowledge.

In this course, you\u0027ll learn about Lean strategies to reduce waste by determining which operations add value and which don\u0027t. You\u0027ll explore the concept of continuous flow, and discover how to balance work processes to make production flow more efficient. You\u0027ll define what waste is, where it exists, and what causes it. You\u0027ll also examine aspects of Muda, continuous flow, line balancing, value and non-value-add, and practical Lean techniques for improving Operations Management.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat is waste in Lean Manufacturing?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA core principle in lean methodology is the removal of waste within an operation. And in any business, one of the heaviest drains on profitability is waste. Lean waste can come in the form of time, material, and labor. But it may also be related to the utilization of skill-sets as well as poor planning. In lean manufacturing, waste is any expense or effort that is expended but which does not transform raw materials into an item the customer is willing to pay for. By optimizing process steps and eliminating waste, the only true value is added at each phase of production.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday, the Lean Manufacturing model recognizes 8 types of waste within an operation; seven originally conceived when the Toyota Production System was first conceived, and an eighth added when the lean methodology was adopted within the Western World. Seven of the eight wastes are production process-oriented, while the eighth waste is directly related to management\u2019s ability to utilize personnel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWHAT YOU WILL LEARN to\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eclassify production activities as a value-add, non-value-add, or necessary non-value-add.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eidentify strategies for eliminating waste caused by overproduction and inventory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eidentify strategies for eliminating motion, waiting, and transportation waste.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eidentify elimination strategies for waste caused by overprocessing and defects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ematch cycle time and takt time to their descriptions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eidentify the final three steps for balancing a production line\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/the-concept-of-waste/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4584528_2810_3.jpg","duration":"1 total hour","enrolledStudentsCount":"9,857.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Any professional, who is seeking career growth in the quality management sector","Managers, Supervisors, Team Leaders, CEO, and Senior Managers, who want to encourage continuous improvement for an organisation and responsible for developing lean thinking, practical skills, measurement of production staff, and analysing the performance of the employee in the workplace.","Individuals involved in a continuous improvement project who needs a complete overview of the process"],"tags":["Waste Management"],"rating":{"count":53,"averageValue":"4.2"},"instructors":[{"name":"Islam arid","url":"/user/islam-arid/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.2083335}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"B6F504D33663D8FF4D72","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"2 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/prokon-analysis-and-design-of-3-stories-rcc-building/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4514810,"title":"Prokon Analysis and Design of 3 Stories R.C.C Building","shortDescription":"Prokon Structural Design \u002B Analysis of 3 Stories R.C.C Building (columns, Slab, Foundation, and beams)","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EThis course teaches you all the things required for the structural analysis and design of a r.c.c structural building.

Software such as Matlab\u2122 has been doing a nice work on that direction. However, it is my belief that anyone could use their expertise to create online platforms, for making their models into codes, and codes into user-friendly interfaces.\u0026nbsp; See an amazing discussion I\u0026nbsp;did with Dr Jonathan Karr \u0022Innovating with biomathematics | In Conversation with Jonathan Karr\u0022 on our YouTube channel\u0026nbsp; \u0022Theoretical and Mathematical Biology\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn this course, I use an example for my most recent research period to make a point: \u003Cstrong\u003Euser-friendly interface is imperative for making mathematical models available properly to the medical and biological sciences\u003C/strong\u003E.\u0026nbsp; One of my concerns was JavaScript being powerful enough, it is!
