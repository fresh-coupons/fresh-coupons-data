It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E*\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E javascript course contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript introduction\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript array\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript variables\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript functions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript objects\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript control statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript cookies\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript loop statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript data structures\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript error handling\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript regular expressions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003Esection 3- learn PHP\u0026nbsp;programming language\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis section will learn the basic structure of a web application and how a web browser interacts with a web server.

Many times we resist it. We want things to stay the same. Especially when all is well. Health going well, Love life going well, Career going well, Children behaving NO CHANGE PLEASE! If that were only possible!?!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reality is that things do not stay the same, things are always changing. This is true with personal development, parenting, relationships and everything in life. Granted change happens at different rates, some so slow barely detectable yet things change. In the world of personal development, parenting \u0026amp; relationship development coming to grips with change and managing the change aka change management can be daunting. Reason is, that so much of the change is beyond our control. Yet we do have control over some of the change and we certainly have control of how we respond to change and how we manage change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother truth is that time and change are related. We see change based upon time and we measure change by time and vise versa. The time element can create issues for us. If change doesn\u2019t happen in the time we believe it should we can get frustrated and quit doing our part to direct change to our liking. In parenting this happens all the time. We may try a new way of addressing our children and if they don\u2019t respond as the \u201Cbook\u201D says then \u201Cour child\u201D must be the \u201Cexception to rule\u201D. So we quit. It didn\u0027t work. Why? Because we often see change as two steps, Old way and New way. But in truth there are six main steps connected by bridges with each step having a cycle of steps. There are changes within ourselves and with our children that will operate at different rates. So when we see Old way expecting new way to happen along with our expectations of when the new way should replace old way, we can feel as if change isn\u2019t happening. \u003Cstrong\u003EHowever, if we understand the method of change and its framework we could actually recognize change happening and where we are during the process of change. This gives us a measure of where we are on the journey of change. This shows us the progression of change. And that we are making an impact even when it appears ( especially in the beginning ) we are not. The recognition of our control of change gives us the confidence and will power to continue on the journey of directed change.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHelp Me I\u0027m a parent! : Method Change, Peaceful Management is designed to show you change, what it looks like, how the process is broken down so that you can see where you are in the process of change, so you wont quit, so you\u2019ll achieve the change you are looking for, sooner rather than later or never.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m Coach Hall your instructor for Help Me I\u0027m a parent! : Method Change, Peaceful Management.
