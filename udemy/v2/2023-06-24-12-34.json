It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are practicals of:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E* Javascript Course Contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Array\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Variables\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Functions\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Objects\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Control Statements\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Cookies\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Loop statements\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESee you inside the course\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-practicals-crash-course/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4200228_c917_2.jpg","duration":"38 total mins","enrolledStudentsCount":"84,072.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["For Javascript  Programming Beginners","For People New to Javascript","For People Who want to learn Javascript Fundamentals and later Transition into Web Development"],"tags":["JavaScript"],"rating":{"count":862,"averageValue":"4.1"},"instructors":[{"name":"PROPER DOT INSTITUTE","url":"/user/vivek-dahibhate-2/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.0625}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"74CA32390AC8CB71AE5C","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/a-transformational-journey-through-the-letter-of-hebrews/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5320578,"title":"A Transformational Journey through the Letter of Hebrews","shortDescription":"Discover the Unparalleled Glory of Jesus Christ: Illuminating Insights from the Letter of Hebrews.

Remark, who found the fungal nature of favus in 1837 Berg who reported oral candidiasis in 1841 Wilkinson, who described vaginal candidiasis in 1849.

commercial broiler farms should be prepared to receive new chicks. If litter has been recycled, it may be turned, treated, and/or otherwise managed to reduce ammonia, pathogen ,and insect load. Houses will be heated to provide adequate temperature for the chicks and feed and water lines may be primed so that they are at room temperature prior to placement. Temperature maybe uniform within houses or a temperature gradient may be provided to allow chicks to better\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eadjust their individual temperatures. If a temperature gradient is provided, feeders and waterers should be placed so that birds can adjust their temperature and still have easily access to feed and water. In general, chicks are placed at a ground temperature of approximately 90-95\u00B0F (32.2-35\u00B0C) and temperature is decreased as the birds age at approximately 5\u00B0F (2.8\u00B0C)/week until the temperature is around 70\u00B0F (21\u00B0C). However, this greatly varies based on the management system and breed of bird so temperature should be adjusted based on flock behavior . Many commercial broiler houses have some or extensive environmental control and the ability to implement standard program flock profiles for temperature and ventilation. Chickens in these environments Temperature \u0026amp; ventilation Uniformity of ventilation is ideal to improve flock performance. Poor ventilation may pro-mote excessive litter moisture and increase the exposure of the chickens to enteric pathogens. Poor ventilation may cause excessive ammonia levels, which could be detrimental to the health and welfare of animals and employees\u0026nbsp; Excessive ammonia at the level of the chicks may be less detectable to a standing human and high levels can cause health problems such as corneal ulceration, conjunctivitis, and inflammation/deciliation of the trachea thereby predisposing birds to respiratory pathogens. Broiler processing Based on market needs, broilers will be processed at a target weight or age determined by the individual company. Loading chickens into transport vehicles to move to processing may be done at night or early morning to decrease physical and heat stress during loading. At the processing plant, misting or fans may help keep birds cool and reduce mortality while birds are waiting to be processed. In colder regions, heating systems may be needed. Handling of birds at processing, including unloading and shackling, should be done in a way to minimize trauma to the birds, which would not only be a welfare concern but would lead to increased condemnations. Birds should be rendered unconscious and/or euthanizedin a manner that does not cause undue stress, increase condemnations, or adversely affect food safety.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/poultry-farming-broiler-farming-crash-course/","imageUri":"https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4750792_a09c_2.jpg","duration":"4 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"7,230.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["poultry farming lovers"],"tags":["Poultry Farming"],"rating":{"count":37,"averageValue":"4.1"},"instructors":[{"name":"Mohamed AL ashram","url":"/user/mohamed-taha-288/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.2}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"904F292CE3C4E5F68084","originalPrice":"\u20B91,699","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"3 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/mindset-for-success-and-happiness-complete-mindset-course/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":3230063,"title":"Mindset for Success and Happiness - Complete Mindset Course","shortDescription":"Mindset Coaching and Personal Development for People Who Want a Success and Happiness Mindset for Life","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMindset for Success\u003C/strong\u003E and Happiness - Complete \u003Cstrong\u003EMindset Course\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMindset Coaching\u003C/strong\u003E and Personal Development for People Who Want a Success and Happiness \u003Cstrong\u003EMindset for Life\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can \u003Cstrong\u003Eachieve a mindset\u003C/strong\u003E that positions you for long-term success, happiness, and fulfillment.
