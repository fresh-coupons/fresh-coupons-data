It is also probably the best solution in the market as it is interoperable i.e. Pyspark can easily be managed along with other technologies and other components of the entire pipeline. The earlier big data and Hadoop techniques included batch time processing techniques.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPyspark is an open-source program where all the codebase is written in Python which is used to perform mainly all the data-intensive and machine learning operations. It has been widely used and has started to become popular in the industry and therefore Pyspark can be seen replacing other spark based components such as the ones working with Java or Scala. One unique feature which comes along with Pyspark is the use of datasets and not data frames as the latter is not provided by Pyspark. Practitioners need more tools that are often more reliable and faster when it comes to streaming real-time data. The earlier tools such as Map-reduce made use of the map and the reduce concepts which included using the mappers, then shuffling or sorting and then reducing them into a single entity. This MapReduce provided a way of parallel computation and calculation. The Pyspark makes use of in-memory techniques that don\u2019t make use of the space storage being put into the hard disk. It provides a general-purpose and a faster computation unit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe skills related to development, big data, and the Hadoop ecosystem and the knowledge of Hadoop and analytics concepts are the tangible skills that you can learn from these PySpark Tutorials.

Time series data is a collection of data over some time or interval. The data when captured over time typically might have some internal structure, for example, autocorrelation, trends, seasonality, stationarity, and many such fundamentals. For example, let us think about the sales of umbrellas or raincoats. We can see that in the selling of these items we might encounter a seasonality aspect, that they might be sold high during the onset of the rainy season. Also, we can see that the data itself might auto-correlate itself to the promos that might have been set by some stores, online or offline, and many more such intricate detailing through the understanding of time series analysis fundamentals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow when we know how to analyze the time series it becomes pretty evident that what exactly to do with the studies or hypothesis we developed as a part of the study.

Now since python GUI is very specific to Python, let us look at what GUI essentially means, and then we may be able to jump into understanding specifically Python GUI. GUI or in other words, Graphical User Interface is a form of a connection tool through which users would be able to interact with electronic devices. This interaction is through the use of buttons and graphical icons which makes it visually appealing for users to use and the software behind the icons removes the robotic coding required to perform the particular task. The intention of the introduction of GUI is thought to reduce the commands that need to be typed at the command-line interface (CLI) through keyboard and that exactly what task it does!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow coming to Python GUI, let us say, for example, we would need to run a code in python, a .py file through the command line. We would create a simple GUI which might have a button \u201CRun\u201D and once a user clicks on that the python file which intends to run will automatically get selected and will run. What Python GUI would do essentially is remove the unnecessary coding part of running the python file through CLI.

Java IO consists of many subclasses for file access, buffering, network access, filtering, intercommunication, pipes, reading, and writing text. Java IO has two types of streams namely input streams and output streams. They are programming interfaces to the streams. Two general-purpose classes file input stream and file output stream used to copy a file to file. It also has some classes for the file to represent a file, random access files, Tokenizer. file handling in Java is performed by Java IO API. when a user request to process a read a file, a file system determines where the file lives in the drive then it places them in the memory. While talking about Output stream class there are useful methods of output stream respectively with a hierarchy and similar to this is Input streams java io package has object input and object output respectively.

It talks and explains the networking basics which is much more helpful for the beginners who are new to the world and domain of networking. This OSPF Certification course of Routing Protocol OSPF builds a strong foundation for them to prepare for good level certifications like CCNA. You will be able to learn all the terminologies and key functionalities related to routing protocols. There is n number of routing protocols that are developed today but only very few have been adopted by the industry. In this course, all those concepts will be explained in detail and you can practice them at your ease. The broad areas to be covered are related to configurations, operations, and troubleshooting. Apart from that, there are a few use cases of two very popular Routing protocols that work on the principle of OSPF and have their level of advantages. This OSPF Certification Module describes how to connect and configure and operate Open Shortest Path First which was specifically designed for IP networks and therefore supports IP tagging and sub-netting of extremely derived information related to routing. It also allows the packet-based information and authentication to take place and also makes use of the multicast for Internet protocol when either sending or receiving any packet\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis course module named Routing Protocols RIP and EIGRP is quite similar to the one used above and is also responsible to teach you many basics and fundamental concepts such as those related to troubleshooting, operation, and configuration. The two most important routing protocols which will be explained in detail are the RIP also known as Routing information protocol and the other is EIGRP which is the abbreviated form for Extended interior Gateway protocol. In the RIP protocol, the oldest of the vectors for distance IP Routing protocols are still put to use and thereby getting various enhancements. There are currently two versions that exist for the RIP viz. RIPv1 and RIPv2. RIPv1 is also said to be the classful protocol which means that it is not classless whereas if you talk about the RIPv2, it is considered to be the classless support routing protocol and IPv6 is the one whose support is extended to RIPv2 with the next-gen RIP which is also termed as RIPng. EIGRP, on the other hand, is related to the Interior Gateway protocol as it is a proprietary protocol of the company CISCO. This protocol is occasionally described as the distance vector routing protocol which also acts and imitates like a link state-oriented protocol. Distance vector-based protocols share everything of which they are aware of. The only limitation they carry is that the amount of information shared is only among the neighbors which are directly or indirectly connected with each other. Link state-based protocols announce that the information present is only about the direction and not indirectly connected links. However, they are also responsible to share the routing protocol information among themselves in all the areas they deem fit among all the routes in their domain or area.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/cisco-ospf-hands-on-certification-training/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4844382_3644_3.jpg","duration":"10.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"12,773.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["The target audience for this course is anybody who has a keen interest in the field of digital communication and is also aware of how the basics of understanding the networks and other routing protocols and mechanisms such as OSPF Routing.

When IBM Watson defeated the two Jeopardy champions back in 2011, it opened a new era in the practical application of Artificial Intelligence technology and contributed to the growing research and interest in this field. IBM Watson has evolved from being a game show winning question \u0026amp; answering computer system to a set of enterprise-grade artificial intelligence (AI) application program interfaces (API) available on IBM Cloud. These Watson APIs can ingest, understand \u0026amp; analyze all forms of data, allow for natural forms of interactions with people, learn, reason - all at a scale that allows for business processes and applications to be reimagined. This course is intended for business and technical users who want to learn more about the cognitive capabilities of IBM Watson Discovery service. This is a high-level view of the tooling and technology that make up IBM Watson Discovery. After taking this course you will gain a better understanding of the types of enrichments that can be applied to your dataset and how to use the IBM Watson Discovery user interface to explore your data. This practical course on IBM Watson is designed to teach you how to build intelligent AI, ML, and Cognitive Computing based applications and systems. Beginning with an introduction to IBM Watson and exploring its components/features, you will learn how it can solve common pitfalls and be beneficial for your businesses. You will then learn the core Cognitive Computing techniques, concepts, and practices that Watson adopts and makes accessible to all.

This tool makes use of PigLatin language which is used along with Hadoop for data manipulation and their operations. Pig Latin is a high-level language which provides numerous operators using which programmers can develop their functions for reading, writing as well as processing the data. To be able to do data analysis through this tool, the script must be composed using the Pig Latin language. The scripts are then converted to Map and Reduce tasks. Pig Engine accepts the pig Latin scripts as its inputs thereby generating map-reduce jobs. The pig training is best for all the programmers as it ensures that complex pieces of Java code are not required now to execute simple tasks and achieve simple functionality. Instead, it follows a multi-query approach which reduces the lines of code used for programming. Just to compare 200 lines of Java code can be done in 10 lines of PIG code.

This is a comprehensive project based course where you will learn step by step on how to create and animate interactive presentation slides using AI. In addition, you will also learn how to make hyper realistic AI avatars that look like humans and they will read the presentation slides for you. Even more exciting, once the presentation is ready, you will do the presentations in virtual reality where you can invite people to join your metaverse. In the introduction session, you will learn how AI can help you to create presentation slides, for examples like generating designs, generating presentation contents, and animating the slides. Then, in the next session, you will continue by learning the ideal presentation structure, such as introduction, content overview, main body, conclusion and you will also get to know what components that should be included in each section. Afterward, you will enter the first project section where you will be guided step by step on how to generate compelling presentation slides using ten AI tools like Boardmix, Slides Pilot, GPT PPT, Plus Docs, Gamma, Tome, Slideoo AI, Power Mode AI, Magic Slides, and Send Steps. In this section, you will use those AI tools to generate presentation slides for a variety of purposes like creating market research reports, investor pitch, educational materials, consulting reports, and minimum viable products. Then, in the second project section, you will learn how to animate your presentation slides using an AI tool called Visme, you will specifically learn how to make a smooth transition from one slide to another slide. In the third section, you will learn how to utilize AI avatars to read your presentation slides and do the presentation on your behalf. In this section, you are going to use AI tools called Hour One AI and Colossyan. Meanwhile, in the last project section, you will learn how to do presentations in virtual reality using Framevr IO. This tool will enable you to do presentations in stunning metaverse and you can also do presentations in many different places, for example, like virtual offices, virtual classrooms, and outdoor theaters. Lastly, at the end of the course, you will also learn how to sell customizable presentation templates on Etsy and offer freelancing services to create custom presentations for your clients\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirstly, before getting into the course, we need to ask this question to ourselves: why should we utilize AI to create presentation slides? Well there are many reasons and let me answer that question. First of all, you will be able to automate and speed up the process of creating, designing, and animating presentation slides. Can you imagine how long will it take you to write contents for each slide, how long will it take you to design each slide? How long will it take you to add animation to each slide? Well, if you do everything manually, it is going to be very time consuming. However, by outsourcing some of your work to AI, not only will you save a lot of time but you will also be more efficient. Other than that, almost everyone needs to do a presentation, whether you are a student, teacher, professional workers, or even business owners.

This module helps developers to seamlessly integrate Python and Mongo DB. Now let us take some time to do a deep dive into individually understanding Python and MongoDB. To start, Python is a high-level general programming language, which was aimed to be used as a programing language for nearly all use cases and has the potential to enhance the code readability, due to its usage of extensive whitespaces. The approach of object-oriented and super language constructions makes it the go-to programming language for any type of use cases ranging from data analytics to API development and many such more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow coming to what Mongo is. Mongo is a database program that was built with the intent of it being cross-platform. Hence you would see a lot of programming language which has the integration functionality with Mongo DB. This program is classified as a NoSQL, essentially meaning a non-relational database. Now a question might strike, that if it is non-relational, then how elements are represented in Mongo. For this, the answer is that mongo Db uses Json like structures with a schema.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConstant efforts are been put in so that our learners can access top-notch resources from top-notch faculties at just a click of a mouse.

This and Java would probably be two of the biggest buzzwords in the late 1990s and early 2000s, when the internet was rising rapidly and so were its development standards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EXML is one of the most hyped terms in web development, but how important is it? How big a deal is XML for web development? In the shortest words, XML makes your web applications, including websites, more powerful, versatile and smarter. This guide removes all the hype surrounding XML that has characterized most of its discussions. It instead focuses on delivering the knowledge and background needed to master this markup language.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere, we give you a general introduction to our training program for XML for web development. To begin with, let\u2019s start with what XML is all about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout XML For Web Development\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat is XML? Let\u2019s start with its full-form, shall we? XML stands for Extensible Markup Language. To make things simple, let\u2019s break this down to an explanation of each of the three words.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExtensible: Above all, XML is an extensible language. This means that you have the freedom to define your tags and the order of their occurrence, and how they are displayed and processed. In other words, extensibility here refers to how XML lets you extend your idea of a document. It could be transient data flowing between systems, like Web Services, or it could be a traditional file in a server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMarkup: The above paragraph talked about defining tags. And tags make up most of this language. In XML, these tags are referred to as elements, and the elements made in XML are very similar to those you make using HTML. However, as mentioned above, the key different between the two markup languages \u2013 XML and HTML \u2013 is that XML lets you define your own elements.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanguage: Finally, despite their differences, XML and HTML share a lot of similarities, which is a good thing considering you can easily switch from HTML to XML. However, XML is a lot more flexible than its predecessor. And it is also important to note that XML is more than just a simple markup language. It is a meta-language, in that it lets the user define or create other languages. XML has helped programmers create other languages like the mathematical markup language, MathML, and RSS. It has also been used to make tools such as XSLT.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy is XML important?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that you know a little about what XML is, let\u2019s look at why it is so important for web development. XML is needed because it does what HTML cannot do. HTML was designed specifically for describing documents to display them on a web browser. Apart from that, HTML can make it rather difficult to do more complicated things, like displaying documents on a mobile device or translating content to other languages. Its main purpose is to create and share web documents quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand, XML is more than just about the web. It is also usable for other purposes, beyond just serving as an interface between the user and the content. For instance, XML is used by Web Services to send responses and requests. HTML rarely provides information on the structure of a document or the reasoning behind this structure. In simple terms, XML is a data description language and HTML is a presentation language.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/xml-novice-to-ninja/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/1983628_027a_3.jpg","duration":"30 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"10,518.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Students pursuing graduation in an IT field","Students pursuing post-graduation in an IT field","Working professionals who want to expand their IT knowledge","Developers that want a jumpstart to their XML learning","People who want to learn how to build a website or to improve the effectiveness of their website","Students in college, studying any stream","Web developers and IT professionals who want to explore XML in greater depth"],"tags":["XML","XML Schema"],"rating":{"count":75,"averageValue":"3.7"},"instructors":[{"name":"EDUCBA Bridging the Gap","url":"/user/premananda-suna/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":3.8}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"EDUCBADEC1297","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"\u20B9449","expirationText":"5 hours","discountPercentage":44}}},"freeCourses":{}}
