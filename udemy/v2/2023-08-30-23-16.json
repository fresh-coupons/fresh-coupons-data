You will also learn how to create Trojans by disguising ordinary files (such as an image or pdf file) and sending fake emails that appear as if they were sent from the target\u0027s friend, boss, or any email account they are likely to interact with in order to run your Trojan. .\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.

This OSPF Certification Module describes how to connect and configure and operate Open Shortest Path First which was specifically designed for IP networks and therefore supports IP tagging and sub-netting of extremely derived information related to routing.

In the RIP protocol, the oldest of the vectors for distance IP Routing protocols are still put to use and thereby getting various enhancements. There are currently two versions that exist for the RIP viz. RIPv1 and RIPv2. RIPv1 is also said to be the classful protocol which means that it is not classless whereas if you talk about the RIPv2, it is considered to be the classless support routing protocol and IPv6 is the one whose support is extended to RIPv2 with the next-gen RIP which is also termed as RIPng. EIGRP, on the other hand, is related to the Interior Gateway protocol as it is a proprietary protocol of the company CISCO. This protocol is occasionally described as the distance vector routing protocol which also acts and imitates like a link state-oriented protocol. Distance vector-based protocols share everything of which they are aware of. The only limitation they carry is that the amount of information shared is only among the neighbors which are directly or indirectly connected with each other. Link state-based protocols announce that the information present is only about the direction and not indirectly connected links. However, they are also responsible to share the routing protocol information among themselves in all the areas they deem fit among all the routes in their domain or area.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/cisco-ospf-hands-on-certification-training/","imageUri":"https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4844382_3644_3.jpg","duration":"10.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"6,024.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["The target audience for this course is anybody who has a keen interest in the field of digital communication and is also aware of how the basics of understanding the networks and other routing protocols and mechanisms such as OSPF Routing.
