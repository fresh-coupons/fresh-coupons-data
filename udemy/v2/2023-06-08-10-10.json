This course has been designed by a lifelong astrology student of 25\u002B years, who has studied both Western and Sidereal Techniques. Your course teacher initially embraced the study of astrology in the early 1990s, after beating terminal cancer continued their spiritual journey through Nadi Sidereal Astrology from 2010 until today. In addition, my research has taken me on long-distance journeys where I\u2019ve studied the effects of Astrocartography. I have used astrology to better understand and manage mental illness and chronic diseases, I have used it to predict my marriage and I love to use it in business on the stock market. This science should be analyzed from all angles possible to give a more accurate prediction. Regardless if you\u0027re a beginner or familiar with some predicting techniques, this course will take your predicting and understanding of the wider elements of astrology to the next stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EI highly recommend going through the assignment and quizzes and remembering to take the whole chart into consideration, not just one placement.

I use multiple techniques and methods from both the tropical and sidereal systems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have never known a person that walked into astrology without asking bigger questions. With astrology, we can see many things. It\u0027s a general rule of thumb not to predict death or diagnosis. Unless otherwise a licensed and qualified professional. When in doubt, seek professional help if needed. And they do exists!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have used astrology to understand many things in my own life from mental illness (genetic) to incurable diseases such as cancer, and use it on a regular basis in my daily life for the Stockmarket (Disclaimer* not a financial advisor), for choosing auspicious days to have surgery or signs contracts and buying my lotto tickets. I\u0027ve enjoyed traveling and documenting both my husband\u0027s and my experience with Astro-Cartography in at least 12 countries together. I have been conducting private research on mental illness and cancer. It is my hope one day that we might just use astrology to help diagnose someone early before a terminal stage of cancer. Like myself, I was diagnosed with metastatic ovarian cancer at only 28 around my Saturn return in the first house. No, that one statement does not mean you\u0027ll get cancer.*** \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI still believe western medicine and experienced surgeons help save my life.

How does a seemingly simple combination of text and images create an interactive and dynamic user experience? The answer lies in the trinity of web development: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Together, these three technologies form the backbone of modern web design and development, enabling the creation of engaging, accessible, and responsive websites.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn this introductory course, we will delve into the essentials of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a solid foundation for aspiring web developers. By the end of this course, you will have a strong understanding of these technologies and be well-equipped to embark on your journey in web development.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHTML: The Structure of the Web\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/strong\u003EHTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the cornerstone of any webpage. At its core, HTML provides the basic structure and content of a webpage. It uses a system of tags and attributes to define elements like headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more. These tags act as containers for content, allowing developers to create a meaningful and organized layout for their webpages.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you begin your study of HTML, you will learn about the key elements that make up the structure of a webpage. These include the doctype declaration, the html element, head and body elements, and a variety of content-specific tags. You will also explore semantic HTML, which emphasizes the use of meaningful tags to convey the purpose and structure of content, ultimately making the web more accessible and search-engine friendly.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECSS: Styling the Web\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/strong\u003EWhile HTML provides the foundation of a webpage, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) brings it to life with style and flair. CSS is a stylesheet language that allows developers to control the visual presentation of HTML elements, including colors, fonts, layout, and even animations. By separating content (HTML) from presentation (CSS), developers can create consistent and maintainable designs across multiple webpages.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThroughout this course, you will explore various CSS properties and selectors that allow you to target and style specific HTML elements. We will cover topics such as the box model, positioning, typography, and responsive design principles. You will learn how to create external stylesheets, enabling you to easily apply consistent styles to multiple webpages. Ultimately, you will gain an understanding of how to create visually appealing and accessible web designs.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavaScript: Interactivity and Dynamic Content\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/strong\u003EThe final piece of the web development puzzle is JavaScript, a powerful and versatile programming language. JavaScript breathes life into your webpages by enabling interactivity, dynamic content, and real-time updates. With JavaScript, you can create responsive user interfaces, validate user input, and even build complete web applications.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn this section of the course, you will learn the fundamentals of JavaScript, including variables, data types, functions, and control structures. You will explore the Document Object Model (DOM), a programming interface that allows JavaScript to interact with and manipulate HTML and CSS. Additionally, you will gain insight into key concepts such as event handling, asynchronous programming, and AJAX.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EBy understanding how JavaScript interacts with HTML and CSS, you will have the ability to create dynamic and engaging web experiences that respond to user input and adapt to different devices and screen sizes.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPutting It All Together\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/strong\u003EAs you progress through this course, you will work on various hands-on projects that will help solidify your understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These projects will challenge you to apply the concepts you have learned, allowing you to create functional and visually appealing webpages.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EBy the end of this foundational course, you will be well-prepared to tackle more advanced web development topics, such as responsive design, accessibility, performance optimization, and even server-side programming.

This course provides an in-depth overview of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). The EC2 service is an essential building block in becoming an AWS certified cloud practitioner. We will start with exploring key concepts relevant to EC2, followed by a hands-on practical guide to deploying compute resources on AWS. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe term \u201CScalable Cloud Computing\u201D has now become synonymous with Amazon Web Services. For nearly a decade, AWS has been powering some of the world\u2019s most popular websites and applications. Amazon EC2, is considered the computational backbone of AWS.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ETo illustrate how Amazon EC2 works, we explore the concept of virtualization. Virtualization is the process of creating a software-based virtual representation of a server.

Not all cloud services were created equal. AWS, is known to have the highest level of configuration options when compared to just about any other service. The AWS platform caters to both micro and enterprise level clients, using one of the most scalable and advanced virtualization infrastructures available.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EBeyond the physical hardware customization and scalability, virtualization also accommodates the deployment of any operating system on the virtual machine.

React, also known as React JS, is a powerful JavaScript library used for building custom, interactive user interfaces using UI components. Some of the most well known examples of organizations using React for their front-end include Netflix, Facebook, and Airbnb. Developed and maintained by Meta along with a community of independent developers, React remains free and open-source. React is a component based library built entirely on JavaScript, which makes it perfect for designing complex UI\u2019s. With React, developers can build encapsulated components that efficiently manage their own state and render UI updates specifically when data changes. For example, think of the automated content refresh feature you see on a twitter feed, or facebook like button. Here the state of the UI component changes on the page, without having to manually refresh when the data is updated. This is just one small, yet powerful feature of React.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThrough a complete hands-on project, this course will teach you all the fundamental principles of React that you must know to become a proficient React developer. We start right from the basics, including the tools needed to get started. From there we dive into JSX, functional components, props, callbacks, and various OnClick events. By this stage, the calculator will have a complete visual display, coupled with functional arithmetic operations. Students then move on to passing parameters in Callback functions, using the React State Hook, and debugging.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn addition to the hands-on React module, we also offer a comprehensive overview of JavaScript for those who need a refresher. Here we start with introducing students to the document object model (DOM) which defines the logical structure of HTML documents. From there we dive into JavaScript to demonstrate various methods in which DOM elements can be manipulated to add interactivity to static components. We start right from the basics, which includes JavaScript placement, and data output. From there we move on to variable declaration, arithmetic operations, operator precedence, data types, and objects. Once the foundations are covered, we move on to more complex operations using Arrays, Conditional Statements, JavaScript comparison operators, booleans and loops. Here students will learn to unleash the true power of JavaScript to render different outcomes based on user interaction. We will explore the use of functions to efficiently handle repetitive tasks and JavaScript events to handle output based on actions and occurrences. The section will conclude with a hands-on project where students will implement their knowledge to build a web based photo gallery and background color changer. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAs you can see this course covers a tremendous bit of ground.

It assumes that you\u0027re new to the language, so it gets you started with basic functionality such as creating functions, creating variables, and calling these lines of code from your standard HTML pages. It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E*\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E javascript course contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript introduction\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript array\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript variables\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript functions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript objects\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript control statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript cookies\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript loop statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript data structures\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript error handling\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript regular expressions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003Esection 4- learn PHP\u0026nbsp;programming language\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis section will learn the basic structure of a web application and how a web browser interacts with a web server.
