After this, we are going to display the products neatly and dynamically and we going to build the most challenging part of this project which is the cart.

And after all of this, we are simply going to process the payment with stripe and we are going to checkout and place orders finally. At the end of this whole process, we are going to give users the products that they paid for.

It balances and integrates with both Java and HTML. Client-side JavaScript is the most common form of the language. This helps in making a web page not just a static HTML, but more user interactive. User-initiated events such as button clicks, link navigation, and other actions that the user initiates openly or implicitly can be done using JavaScript. Apart from its increased interactivity, it provides rich interfaces to webpages and can provide immediate response to the visitors.\u00A0 There is also lesser server interaction using JavaScript. JavaScript does not require any expensive tool to start working, a simple text editor like Notepad is enough.\n\n  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAll these qualities make it a very important tool for someone who is interested in creating dynamic web pages.

We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E*\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E javascript course contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript introduction\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript array\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript variables\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript functions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript objects\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript control statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript cookies\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript loop statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript data structures\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript error handling\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript regular expressions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/css-bootstrap-javascript-web-development-course/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4548492_0942.jpg","duration":"5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"98,645.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Beginner Full Stack Developers","Beginner Web Developer"],"tags":["CSS","JavaScript","Web Development"],"rating":{"count":1386,"averageValue":"4.2"},"instructors":[{"name":"PROPER DOT INSTITUTE","url":"/user/vivek-dahibhate-2/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.2635136}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"930B27F2D384FD8DCD69","originalPrice":"\u20B92,499","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/continous-integration-jenkins-pipelines/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":1811532,"title":"The Complete Jenkins DevOps CI/CD Pipeline Bootcamp","shortDescription":"Jenkins, Pipeline, Groovy for DevOps Automation using Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline with DSLs with Just One Course!","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EAre you ready to take your DevOps skills to the next level and streamline your software development and deployment processes?

While biologists have made great strides in discovering things on Earth, there are still many new things to learn. The first fundamental questions are: What is Life? What does it mean to have life? These inquiries are essential to the discoveries that biologists find every day. With such a vast scope of information, biologists must organize these discoveries that will stand the test of time. In this unit, we introduce the major topics that biologists study and the theories they use and apply to their work\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EBasic Chemistry\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENature is not based on one field of study. It incorporates biology, physics, chemistry, and other academic disciplines. Life is multidisciplinary and is driven by chemical processes. Since so many biology topics overlap with basic principles of chemistry, you need a basic understanding and appreciation of chemistry to fully understand biology. For example, in Unit 1, we discussed that the atom is the first part of the biological hierarchy. In this unit, we provide an understanding of this foundational level of organization.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBiological Molecules\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBiological molecules are the essential molecules needed for life. These molecules can be organic or inorganic. Organic chemistry is the study of carbon, which is an element that forms strong covalent bonds essential for the foundational structures of all living things. Water, salts, acids, and bases are mostly essential inorganic molecules that facilitate many biological processes. All organisms contain organic biological molecules \u2013 carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and nucleic acid \u2013 that are essential to life. This unit will help you understand the structures and functions of these organic molecules and how our body needs them to function properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003ECells and Cell Membranes\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECells are the smallest units of life. In this unit, we explore the characteristics, components, and functions of cells. Learning about the structures of cells allows us to see the similarities and differences among organisms. Bacteria, plant, animal, and fungus cells are similar in many ways and contain many of the same small structures known as organelles. However, some characteristics help distinguish whether a cell belongs to an animal, plant, fungus, or bacteria. For example, all plant cells contain cell walls, while animal cells lack this particular extracellular structure. The water within a cell that presses against the cell wall gives a plant its rigidity and your celery its crunch!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eclassification\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClassification is a fundamental concept in biology. It\u0027s the process of grouping organisms based on their shared characteristics. This helps scientists understand the relationships between different organisms and how life has evolved over time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are different hierarchical levels of classification, from the broadest (kingdom) to the most specific (species). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EMetabolism, Enzymes, and Cellular Respiration\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMetabolism refers to the sum total of every chemical reaction in every organism. Cells use enzymes and metabolic pathways to conduct these chemical reactions. It is essential to understand the reactions that comprise metabolism to learn how organisms acquire and use energy to survive. Since this process is quite complicated, we will explore it from several different angles in this unit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EPhotosynthesis\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave you ever wondered how a plant grows from a tiny acorn into a giant oak tree? Where does all that biomass come from? How does it get the energy to grow? Photosynthesis is the fascinating process plants use to convert light energy to chemical energy. Because plants are at the bottom of the food pyramid in almost all ecological systems, understanding how they grow and develop will give you a greater understanding of your environment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003ECellular Reproduction: Mitosis\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrganisms require their cells to divide for the purposes of reproduction, growth, development, or repair. Cellular division is divided into two phases: mitosis and cytokinesis. Mitosis involves the division of the nuclear chromosomes, while cytokinesis is the division of the cytoplasmic components into new daughter cells. Serious consequences, such as cancer, can occur if this cell cycle is disrupted in some way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003ECellular Reproduction: Meiosis\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeiosis is a specialized type of cellular reproduction that only occurs in the ovaries and testes and results in an egg or sperm, respectively. Sexual reproduction is responsible for the amazing amount of diversity within a species. When sperm fertilizes an egg, the resulting offspring contain genes from the father and the mother. In essence, you contain genes from ALL of your ancestors, at least in a small part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/biology-what-is-life/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4631278_3467.jpg","duration":"2 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"2,149.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["medical students ,biology students chemistry students"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":14,"averageValue":"4.5"},"instructors":[{"name":"Mohamed AL ashram","url":"/user/mohamed-taha-288/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.571429}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"E3AD1EB6FDAE2630D754","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"\uD83E\uDD37\u200D\u2640","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/amazon-seo-guide-how-to-rank-first-on-amazon-tareq-hajj/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":6256839,"title":"Amazon SEO Guide: How to Rank First on Amazon","shortDescription":"Master Amazon SEO: Boost Product Visibility, Drive Sales, and Optimize Listings for Success","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EUnlock the secrets to skyrocketing your sales on Amazon with our comprehensive course on Amazon SEO!
