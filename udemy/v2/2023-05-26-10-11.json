The course starts right from the basics, where we explore various cloud computing service models. This includes infrastructure as a service, platform as a service, and software as a service. From there students gain hands-on experience with creating and administering remote virtual instances, complete with Ubuntu, Apache, MariaDB, and PHP. Students will learn the difference between popular web servers like Apache and NGINX, along with a detailed overview of various database management systems. This includes both SQL and NoSQL databases, in addition to database transaction standards such as ACID and CAP Theorem. In addition to a theoretical deep dive, the course demonstrates how to install, configure, and secure LAMP stack on Ubuntu for hosting dynamic, database driven web apps. We offer a detailed segment on server security, where students will configure both software and network firewalls for their instance using strict firewall policies, UFW and custom SSH ports. At this stage students will also learn to scale their servers both vertically and horizontally using application load balancers. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe second half of the course provides a comprehensive guide to Amazon Web Services.

From there, we take a deep dive into AWS Identity and Access management for enhanced account security, and the management of user accounts for various AWS services. Here we explore IAM User management and permissions, IAM Groups, IAM Policies, and access key rotation. Following the IAM section, we\u2019ll jump into the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) service. In this module students lean to deploy virtual instances on AWS using Amazon Machine Images, Elastic IPs, and Launch Templates.

Here we will explore important concepts such as catalog settings, import file handling, auto renaming, metadata presets, and import preferences. Once students are familiar with the basics, we take a theoretical dive into a number of concepts and key terms that are essential in the photography and digital image editing arena. Here we will explore various file formats, color spaces, image resolution, pixel density, and much more. From there, we transition back to completing application setup by exploring file handling options, interface preferences, identity plate setup, and watermarking with both text and graphics.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOnce we\u2019ve covered the foundations, students will take a deep dive into the Lightroom Library Module.

This section starts from the basics, where we explore the Library interface. From there, students learn to filter files, paint keywords, and generate keyword sets. We\u2019ll also demonstrate how to use various library views for image comparison, and advanced sorting. Once students have a handle of the foundations, we cover more intermediate sorting techniques using star ratings, pick and reject flags, color labels, and smart collections.

It was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994. The PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group. PHP originally stood for \u003Cem\u003EPersonal Home Page\u003C/em\u003E, but it now stands for the recursive initialism \u003Cem\u003EPHP: Hypertext Preprocessor\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPHP code is usually processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module, a daemon, or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. On a web server, the result of the interpreted and executed PHP code \u2013 which may be any type of data, such as generated HTML or binary image data \u2013 would form the whole or part of an HTTP response. Various web template systems, web content management systems, and web frameworks exist which can be employed to orchestrate or facilitate the generation of that response. Additionally, PHP can be used for many programming tasks outside of the web context, such as standalone graphical applications and robotic drone control. Arbitrary PHP code can also be interpreted and executed via a command-line interface (CLI).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe standard PHP interpreter, powered by the Zend Engine, is free software released under the PHP License. PHP has been widely ported and can be deployed on most web servers on almost every operating system and platform, free of charge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe PHP language evolved without a written formal specification or standard until 2014, with the original implementation acting as the \u003Cem\u003Ede facto\u003C/em\u003E standard which other implementations aimed to follow. Since 2014, work has gone on to create a formal PHP specification.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs of January 2021, 72% of PHP websites use discontinued versions of PHP, i.e. PHP 7.2 or lower, which are no longer supported by The PHP Development Team. A large additional fraction uses PHP 7.3, which is only (up to December 6, 2021) \u0022supported for critical security issues only.\u0022 Over 40% of all PHP websites use version 5.6 or older, which not even Debian supports (Debian 9 supported version 7.0 and 7.1).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBeginner Friendliness\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEasy to Get Started With\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPHP was designed to make web development easier, and many beginners find it effortless to pick up and get started with. In fact, PHP code was so easy to pick up, many non-programmers end up being able to hack PHP code together without truly understanding the code. While good programmers will never copy and paste code they don\u0027t understand, this speaks volumes about how easy it is to pick up PHP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe latest version of PHP (PHP8) has fixed a lot of inconsistencies and fatal errors as well. PHP has a wealth of learning resources, but you should make sure to avoid outdated tutorials.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFlexible\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPHP is a dynamically typed language.

Google uses Dart to develop many of its main applications including Ads which as you can imagine must require quite a solid build.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDart is very flexible in the way it is compiled and executed, it is in fact the only programming language capable of compiling JIT (Just In Time \u2014 used during development) and AOT (Ahead Of Time \u2014 used when the app is released), it can also be compiled to Javascript in order to be run by browsers or straight to native code. This means its execution is \u003Cem\u003Efast.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks to its versatility Dart can be used for client or server-side development. The syntax looks like \u2018C\u2019 meaning it is statically typed so this provides more certainty on the types of values you are passing on, but it is also meant to be used in OOP, if you have a background in C you\u2019ll pick it up quick.

Long before the pandemic, the mix of fitness technology and digital fitness was altering our market; both areas were rising at a rapid pace. This transition affects both consumers (gym goers) and suppliers (gyms/personal trainers) now more than ever before. Fitness businesses and members alike have invested in home new-age fitness equipment - and the fitness industry has shifted online to survive: gyms have improved their online offerings, and members have improved their home set-ups, investing in a variety of equipment, apps, wearables, and fitness trackers for the long-term. The use of social media in gym marketing has become a must. It\u0027s a channel via which people can quickly obtain information. They can provide gym-specific advice or information, thereby educating followers on health and wellness and boosting the active-living trend. Owners are rewarded with useful comments, allowing them to establish a solid business reputation, increase member trust, and attract new potential consumers by mentioning their brand online. People are too communicating with each other online in greater numbers than ever before. They follow an influencer on Instagram, subscribe to a fitness channel on YouTube, join a fitness group on Facebook, and like a friend\u0027s Instagram post about weight reduction success. Gyms are starting to recognise the social component of fitness by making it look that fitness is less about attending the gym and more about living a healthy lifestyle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fitness industry has had to conform to a new normal; future gyms will be hybrid and virtual reality, and gym members will track their progress and exercise both in and out of the gym even digitally!!

They can also create goals and track their progress over time by digging deeper into the tracker\u0027s dashboard. There are plenty of virtual reality programmes nowadays too, you can use to burn calories, but just a few are exclusively focused on exercise right now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApps for fitness have never been more important.

The answer can already be found in the first sentence. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAudio social media systems appear to fulfil a long-held goal for free and democratic social media. Decentralisation offers a wide range of applications, from cryptocurrency to social media. Unlike podcasts or livestreams, social audio platforms are more of an open conversation than a monologue. Even if you\u0027re in a chatroom full of strangers, group voice chats feel strangely intimate. Audio social media platforms allow users a more democratic option to get their opinion heard in a world where platforms are becoming pay-to-play. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBrands may be able to test audio-based ad formats on audio social networks at some point in the future. They would also be able to \u0022sponsor\u0022 particular discussions, similar to how adverts appear on streaming radio and podcasts. Individual chat rooms would most likely have audio advertising \u2014 a company representative or host would provide a short commercial at the start, middle, and/or end of a conversation. Social audio platforms tend to draw niche audiences, ranging from astrology enthusiasts to side hustlers, providing the ideal opportunity for companies to get in front of their target audience in an audio format. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAccessibility is critical to the development of social media. Some apps or software as we know it are inaccessible to persons who are deaf or hard of hearing due to their audio-only nature. Discord has added certain accessibility features, including text-to-speech and greater screen-reader integration, in response to similar criticisms. Audio platforms must ensure that their platform is accessible to everyone in order to survive. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne way audio platforms keep users interested is through attracting influencers and celebrities who funnel their audience from other media. Allowing live talks to be recorded and distributed in a podcast format may also assist platforms attract listeners who are unable to attend live chats.\u0026nbsp;Keep that in mind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, let\u0027s talk about how \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Space Render\u0026nbsp;Classic Edition:\u0026nbsp;Create Live Audio Rooms\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E course made by Digital Marketing Legend \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Srinidhi\u0026nbsp;Ranganathan\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u0026nbsp; fits here and is deemed to be world-changing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this mind-blowing course, we will look at hosting audio-based events from a marketers\u0027 point of view to promote himself or herself via a web-portal.\u0026nbsp;Imagine marketing yourself on a browser instead of a mobile app. This seems to be something like Clubhouse for web.

Since then, it has been widely adopted in a variety of industries.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Greek letter sigma is used by statisticians to represent the variation in a process and we all know that. Six Sigma is usually defined as \u201CA fact-based, data-driven philosophy of improvement that favours defect prevention over defect detection\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESix Sigma practitioners have created a variety of methodologies over the years to make the approach to these initiatives consistent and driven by tactics that have proven successful over time.

This course teaches you the fundamentals of Six Sigma. It not just helps with change management within your company but also helps your organization to prepare for the new normal. Customer expectations or demands are constantly changing in this world governed by technology. Six Sigma\u0027s emphasis on customer satisfaction enables the company to produce higher-quality products and increase customer loyalty over time. A product-focused strategy compares the product to the products of competitors in order to reach or slightly exceed such levels. You must know that Six Sigma focuses on minimising process variation and improving process control, whereas lean encourages work standardisation and flow by eliminating waste (non-value added processes and procedures).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease note that to achieve success leveraging the Six Sigma methodology, organisational processes must have a failure rate of no more than 3.4 per million (99.99966%) chances. A Six Sigma defect is anything that isn\u0027t according to the client\u0027s specifications. Its goal is to reduce the amount of variation in commercial and production operations. The capacity to focus on producing quantitative and measurable financial gains from any Six Sigma project is one of the most notable features. Employees can identify problem areas as well as reoccurring difficulties that affect the overall quality expectation of a service or product from a customer\u0027s perspective using Six Sigma methodology.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy opt for this course - the proven game-changer?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy completing this\u003Cstrong\u003E \u0022Lean Six Sigma White Belt Online Course\u0022\u003C/strong\u003E, you will gain the basic understanding of what Lean Six Sigma is and how Lean Six Sigma brings a plethora of benefits to your organization.\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are a professional individual who wants to grow and sustain in this ever-changing competitive world (where speed is no longer just a good to have criteria) and want to discover a way to fit in the new norms with their employees - this course is for you to learn and master!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThis mind-blowing White belt course will walk you through unbelievable insights and learning that you don\u0027t want to miss at all as a newbie entering the world of Lean Six Sigma.\u0026nbsp;What\u0027s more?

Furthermore, the number of users continues to grow, with new individuals joining every day. These rising numbers demonstrate the marketing potential of social media networks. However, marketers face a difficult problem in utilising this potent technique. On social media, your brand must be consistent, accessible, and relevant. It\u0027s also critical to keep track of trends, evaluate the effectiveness of social media campaigns, and communicate with prospects on social media on a regular basis.

In contrast to real numbers that have the property of varying \u0022smoothly\u0022, the objects studied in discrete mathematics \u2013 such as integers, graphs, and statements in logic \u2013 do not vary smoothly in this way, but have distinct, separated values.Discrete mathematics therefore excludes topics in \u0022continuous mathematics\u0022 such as calculus or Euclidean geometry. Discrete objects can often be enumerated by integers. More formally, discrete mathematics has been characterized as the branch of mathematics dealing with countable sets (finite sets or sets with the same cardinality as the natural numbers). However, there is no exact definition of the term \u0022discrete mathematics.\u0022 Indeed, discrete mathematics is described less by what is included than by what is excluded: continuously varying quantities and related notions.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/mathematics-software-development/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/3482670_925d.jpg","duration":"6.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"62,127.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Beginner Java Developers","Beginner Python Developers","Beginner C \u0026 C\u002B\u002B Developers","Computer Science Students","Engineering Students","Employees in Programming Companies"],"tags":["C\u002B\u002B","Computer Science","Discrete Math","Functional Programming"],"rating":{"count":231,"averageValue":"3.6"},"instructors":[{"name":"Martin Yanev","url":"/user/martin-yanev-3/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.15},{"name":"Plamen Yanev","url":"/user/plamen-yanev/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.15}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"MAY-FREE","originalPrice":"\u20B92,299","discountedPrice":"\u20B9449","expirationText":"5 hours","discountPercentage":80}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/excellence-in-business-strategy-modelling-planning/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4587280,"title":"Excellence in Business Strategy, Modelling \u0026 Planning","shortDescription":"Learn Best practices based on classical work of Michael Porter and working with my Managing Directors at J\u0026J India","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFacing challenges in building a successful business sustainably?
