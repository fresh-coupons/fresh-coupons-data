I love that the courses aren\u0027t just pulling numbers from thin air, it actually shows data to back their tactics up. Also, lots of the courses out there talk about high-level marketing strategy, while startup SaaS marketers often have to also know how to execute the strategy as they may be solo marketers in the company. For example, a very hands-on approach to doing ABM on LinkedIn \u002B the software/tools marketers can use are very helpful in the module about ABM marketing. Last but not the least, Dekker introduced many good books (some academic, some easier to read) on the subject matter. I gave 4.5 stars because I figured that the content of each module can be reorganized to be more on-topic (some are a bit repetitive, but I understand that repetition is important in marketing :) ). It would also be great if more SaaS-specific examples can be provided, especially on the topic of PMM\u0027s role in leading product launches, feature updates, etc.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECovenant Chimnonso\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u0022This course has provided me with a different, more advanced view of Product Marketing leadership and a more general view to approaching marketing generally.
