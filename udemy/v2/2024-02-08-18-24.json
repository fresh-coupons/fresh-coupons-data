Did you build a couple of projects with PHP and MySQL, but you still think you are inexperienced and you are missing out on a lot of things when coming to developing bigger projects? If yes, then this course is the right resource for you. This course is very digestible and informative and it was created specifically to enhance your coding skills and knowledge not just in PHP and MySQL, but overall in developing web projects. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is what we are going to do in this course. Naturally, we are going to get started by setting up the right tools for our projects. And after that, we are going to build our first simple yet very interesting project and that\u0027s a URL shortening service. The second project will be about sending emails in PHP and that\u0027s very important because it\u0027s a feature that almost every website has. The next project will be the starting of something big because it\u0027s an authentication system where I am going to teach you how to develop a login and a register page, how to hash and de-hash passwords, how to do validation and so much more. After this, we are going to build a comments system and this will be the biggest project in this course. We will begin first by doing a post system and then we will grab comments for every post that we have of course we will use Ajax-JQuery for inserting, deleting, and showing comments. after that, we will integrate a rating system into the previous two projects to make a bigger project. So, I will show how to download a JQuery plugin, how to integrate it and how to use it to do the rating system for every post, and so on. And the rating system is going to be implemented of course using Ajax-JQuery. The upcoming project is going to be also created with Ajax and JQuery and that\u0027s a live search system and we will combine it with our big project. The last project will be about building a weather app. All we are going to do is set up a form, allow the user to enter a city, and then give him the current degree of this city. So we will use an API to grab the current degree for this city. If that sounds like something that you are interested in, go ahead and get the course now. see you inside!! \u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/php-with-mysql-2023-build-7-php-and-mysql-projects/","imageUri":"https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5010434_6d6a_3.jpg","duration":"6 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"23,500.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Every PHP and MySQL developer who want to advance their skills","Developers who want to explore web development further","Developers who want to build cool projects and to build up their CVs"],"tags":["Bootstrap","MySQL","PHP","PDO"],"rating":{"count":97,"averageValue":"3.7"},"instructors":[{"name":"Web Coding","url":"/user/bdb27e95-65f5-415a-956b-65f62ba4bfc3/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":3.86}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"PHP7PROJECTS46","originalPrice":"\u20B91,699","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/curso-de-manualidades-y-adornos-navidenos/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":1950194,"title":"Curso de Manualidades y Adornos Navide\u00F1os","shortDescription":"Aprende a realizar manualidades y adornos navide\u00F1os para decorar tu casa e iniciar tu propio negocio.","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EEn nuestro \u003Cstrong\u003ECurso de Manualidades y Adornos Navide\u00F1os\u003C/strong\u003E vas a aprender a elaborar adornos y regalos navide\u00F1os como zapatos, caballos y campanas de navidad en miniatura.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESi eres un amante de la Navidad, este es el curso que estabas esperando, en \u00E9l podr\u00E1s hacer paso a paso adornos navide\u00F1os y te ayudamos a decorar tu hogar y \u00E1rbol navide\u00F1o en estas fechas.

This is a comprehensive project based course where you will learn step by step on how to create captivating 3D models using advanced AI technologies. This course will give you a whole new perspective about the future of 3D modeling and game design. You will be fascinated by how far artificial intelligence has advanced in the past couple of years to the point where you can write a simple text prompt to produce high quality 3D models and even more exciting you can also animate those 3D models using AI. In the introduction session, you will learn about AI applications in 3D animations and understand how it can help 3D animators to automate the process of creating and animating 3D models. Then, we are going to start the project section. Firstly, you will learn to create 3D models from text using several AI tools like Tripo AI, Avaturn, Luma AI, Sloyd AI, and MasterPiece X. The process will be very simple, all you need to do is to write the prompt describing how the 3D model should look like, then in less than a minute AI will generate the 3D model. In the next section, you will learn to convert 2D images to hyper realistic 3D models using AI tools like Meshy AI, Alpha 3D, Leia Pix. Afterward, in the third project section, you will learn to animate 3D models using several AI tools like Anything World, Krikey AI, and Charmed AI. After that, you will also learn to create 3D game assets using several AI tools like Layer AI, Scenario, and Game Generator. Meanwhile, in the fifth section, you will perform motion capture using Deep Motion. Then, you will also learn to build virtual reality using Skybox AI. In the last section, you will build a 3D avatar chatbot that has the capability of talking to your web visitor. Then, you will also integrate the 3D avatar chatbot to your website. Can you imagine, you are able to add a super realistic 3D digital human avatar to answer questions from your customers on your website. Well, this is definitely much better compared to regular chatbots that communicate through text messaging systems. At the end of the course, we are going to talk about several important aspects that we need to pay close attention to when creating 3D animations using AI, such as realistic physics and dynamics, cross platform integration, file format compatibility, and context alignment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirstly, before getting into the course, we need to ask this question to ourselves: why should we utilize generative AI for creating 3D animations? Well there are many reasons why and let me answer it from the perspective of 3D animators and game designers, firstly, finding new ideas and design inspirations can be very time consuming. In addition to that, the process of transforming those ideas into 3D models can be quite challenging. Generative AI can help you to automate and speed up the process without reducing the quality of the 3D models. Can you imagine how long it will take you to do 3D modeling, sculpting, rigging, and adding animation to the 3D models? Well, that process is going to take a while. Therefore, outsourcing some part of the work to AI will certainly be a good idea and it will help you to be more productive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow are things that you can expect to learn from this course:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn about AI applications in 3D animations and game assets creation\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to create 3D models using Luma AI, Tripo AI, Sloyd AI, and MasterPiece X\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to transform yourself into 3D avatar using Ready Player Me and Avaturn\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to convert 2D image to 3D model using Meshy AI and Alpha 3D\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to convert 2D image to 3D animation using Leia Pix\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to animate 3D models using MasterPiece X, Charmed AI, and Anything World\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to create 3D animation video using Krikey AI\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to create game assets with Layer AI, Scenario, and Game Generator\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to perform motion capture using Deep Motion\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to build virtual reality using Skybox AI\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to build 3D avatar chatbot using Chattier and integrate the chatbot to website\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/creating-3d-animations-game-asset-avatar-chatbot-with-ai/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5799350_ad51.jpg","duration":"2 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"986.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["People who are interested in creating 3D models, 3D animations, and game assets using AI","People who are interested in building interactive 3D avatar chatbot"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":0,"averageValue":"0.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"Christ Raharja","url":"/user/christ-raharja/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":0}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"086BAE9E261B27071E6C","originalPrice":"\u20B91,999","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/power-app-mastery-from-beginner-to-expert/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5399340,"title":"power apps : Complete Training with practical hands on.","shortDescription":"Microsoft Power Platform (microsoft powerapps, Power Automate and Power Bi) || Live Project with Expert Advice.","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the Microsoft Power Platform course, where you will embark on a transformative journey from a beginner to an expert in PowerApps.

For example, network configuration files can be edited with ease using a text editor. Then those edits can be saved as a shell script for further modification or backup purposes.
