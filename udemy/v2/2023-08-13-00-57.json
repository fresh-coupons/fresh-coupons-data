This is a project based course where you will learn step by step on how to build a news channel and to create news videos with fully animated and super realistic AI powered news anchors. This course will give you a whole new perspective about how artificial intelligence is more than capable of revolutionising journalism. In addition, you will also be amazed by how far AI can automate news videos creation by speeding up the editing process as well as replacing human news anchors with a hyper realistic artificial intelligence powered news anchor as the substitution which can be very useful for independent journalist who want to keep their identity secret due to privacy or safety reasons. In the introduction session, you will learn several aspects where AI can be utilised to create news videos, such as converting news scripts to audio and producing animated news anchors to present the news. Then, you will continue by getting to know several news sources like Google News, AP News, and Reuters as well as learning how to check the potential bias and reliability of the news. This part is very crucial to make sure the news you are planning to cover are actually factual. Afterward, you will get to know several news topic ideas that you should consider and it is really recommended for you just to pick one and concentrate on that one topic. Once you have chosen your news topic, we will enter the main part of the course where you will be guided step by step on how to create and edit news video from scratch using AI tools like HeyGen, HourOne, and Paradiso AI. Those tools will enable you to convert text to audio as well as to integrate the audio with the fully animated news anchors. Once the video has been created and ready to be uploaded, we will go over comprehensive analysis on which social media platform that you should be uploading to. In that section, we will be mainly focusing on Youtube and Tiktok since those two platforms have the most audience and also the best options for video based contents. Last but not least, at the end of the course, you will learn several different ways to monetise your news channel and how to potentially turn this side hustle into a sustainable media business.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, before getting into the course, we need to ask this question to ourselves: why should we build a news channel? Well, if you were asking this question five or ten years ago, at that time, there had not been a lot of independent journalist yet and most of journalists work for media companies, nonetheless, the situation is totally different nowadays, as the rise of independent journalism in the past few years, more and more news channels are created on social media platforms like Youtube and Tiktok. Therefore, anybody can be an independent journalist nowadays and it is very possible to combine it with content creation. The advancement of artificial intelligence technologies in the past couple years also contributed very significantly where today you can even create news channels and upload videos where you are reporting news without showing your face since you can replace it with AI powered news anchors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow are things that you can expect to learn from the course:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to automate news videos creation process using AI\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to analyse and check if the news is unbiased, neutral, accurate, and factual\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to convert news articles from Google News, AP News, and Reuters into news scripts using ChatGPT\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to customise AI powered news anchors avatars\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to create a hyper realistic news videos with AI powered news anchor using HeyGen\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to create a hyper realistic news videos with AI powered news anchor using HourOne\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to create a hyper realistic news videos with AI powered news anchor using Paradiso AI\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to create breaking news intro using Canva\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to add subtitles automatically and edit news videos using Veed IO\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFull comprehensive analysis on which social media platform is the best to host your content videos: comparing Yotube vs Tiktok\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn several different strategies to monetise news videos and how to potentially turn this side hustle into a news channel business\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/automating-journalism-make-news-channel-with-ai-news-anchor/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5489852_b307.jpg","duration":"2.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"399.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Journalists who are interested to use AI to automate their news content creation process","People who are interested in starting a news channel or news agency"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":0,"averageValue":"0.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"Christ Raharja","url":"/user/christ-raharja/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":0}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"599C1794466BC765765E","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/infosec-fundamentals/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4790052,"title":"Information Security Fundamentals","shortDescription":"The very basics of InfoSec","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EThis course is meant for anyone curious about InfoSec and just starting out in this field.

We also discuss how we can solve Atari games problems using DQN in practice using Keras-RL and TF-Agents.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5- In the fifth part, we move to Advanced DRL algorithms, mainly under a family called Policy based methods. We discuss here Policy Gradients, DDPG, Actor-Critic, A2C, A3C, TRPO and PPO methods. We also discuss the important Stable Baseline library to implement all those algorithms on different environments in OpenAI Gym, like Atari and others.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6- Finally, we explore the model-based family of RL methods, and importantly, differentiating model-based RL from planning, and exploring the whole spectrum of RL methods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully, you enjoy this course, and find it useful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/reinforcement-learning-english/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5312986_d313.jpg","duration":"9 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"2,733.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Machine Learning Researchers","Machine Learning Engineers","Data Scientists"],"tags":["Reinforcement Learning"],"rating":{"count":4,"averageValue":"4.9"},"instructors":[{"name":"Coursat.ai Dr. Ahmad ElSallab","url":"/user/coursatai/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.75}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"F651428DAFB6C0C1FC81","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"3 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/ultimate-facebook-advertising-learn-facebook/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5406038,"title":"Ultimate Facebook Advertising | Learn Facebook Ads in 2023","shortDescription":"Facebook Ads Accelerator | Boost Sales From Facebook Ads with Expert Strategies | Beginner Friendly Facebook Marketing","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EWant to become a high-paid \u003Cstrong\u003EFacebook Ads marketer?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAmazing!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis Facebook Ads course will take you from an \u003Cstrong\u003Eabsolute beginner with zero experience to an advanced Facebook Advertiser.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo you can become a high-paid social media marketer and run Facebook Ads with tons of profit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll the information in this course is \u003Cstrong\u003Eup to date\u003C/strong\u003E and \u003Cstrong\u003Erecorded in 2023\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou will have access to the latest features of\u003Cstrong\u003E Facebook Ads (Meta Ads\u003C/strong\u003E) platform.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven if you have no idea about Facebook Advertising this course will teach you the fundamentals and then teach you advanced techniques to make you a Facebook Ads wizard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are an advanced marketer, don\u2019t worry, you will learn a lot.

The term digital forensics was originally used as a synonym for \u003Cstrong\u003Ecomputer forensics\u003C/strong\u003E but has expanded to cover investigation of all devices capable of storing digital data. With roots in the personal computing revolution of the late 1970s and early 1980s, the discipline evolved in a haphazard manner during the 1990s, and it was not until the early 21st century that national policies emerged.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDigital forensics investigations have a variety of applications. The most common is to support or refute a hypothesis before criminal or civil courts. Criminal cases involve the alleged breaking of laws that are defined by legislation and that are enforced by the police and prosecuted by the state, such as theft and assault against the person. Civil cases on the other hand deal with protecting the rights and property of individuals (often associated with family disputes) but may also be concerned with contractual disputes between commercial entities where a form of digital forensics referred to as electronic discovery (discovery) may be involved\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring the 1980s very few specialized digital forensic tools existed, and consequently investigators often performed live analysis on media, examining computers from within the operating system using existing sysadmin tools to extract evidence. This practice carried the risk of modifying data on the disk, either inadvertently or otherwise, which led to claims of evidence tampering. A number of tools were created during the early 1990s to address the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDigital forensics is commonly used in both criminal law and private investigation. Traditionally it has been associated with criminal law, where evidence is collected to support or oppose a hypothesis before the courts. As with other areas of forensics this is often a part of a wider investigation spanning a number of disciplines. In some cases, the collected evidence is used as a form of intelligence gathering, used for other purposes than court proceedings (for example to locate, identify or halt other crimes). As a result, intelligence gathering is sometimes held to a less strict forensic standard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you enroll in our Digital Forensics Masterclass | Forensic Science 2023 DFMC, you\u0027ll not only learn about the fundamentals of digital forensics, but so much more!

Kotlin has classes with constructors, along with nested, inner, and anonymous inner classes, and it has interfaces like Java 8. Kotlin does \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E have a new keyword.

To override a superclass method, the method itself must be marked open, and the subclass method must be marked override. This is all of a piece with Kotlin\u2019s philosophy of making things explicit rather than relying on defaults. In this particular case, I can see where Kotlin\u2019s way of explicitly marking base class members as open for inheritance and derived class members as overrides avoids several kinds of common Java errors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, you\u0027ll learn how to create apps and run them on virtual devices through guided exercises.

We will focus in this part on model-free solutions, and defer model-based solutions to the last part. In this part, we describe the Monte-Carlo and Temporal-Difference sampling based methods, including the famous and important Q-learning algorithm, and SARSA. We will describe the practical usage and implementation of Q-learning and SARSA on control tabular maze problems from OpenAI Gym environments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4- To move beyond simple tabular problems, we will need to learn about function approximation in RL, which leads to the mainstream RL methods today using Deep Learning, or Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). We will describe here the breakthrough algorithm of DeepMind that solved the Atari games and AlphaGO, which is Deep Q-Networks or DQN. We also discuss how we can solve Atari games problems using DQN in practice using Keras-RL and TF-Agents.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5- In the fifth part, we move to Advanced DRL algorithms, mainly under a family called Policy based methods. We discuss here Policy Gradients, DDPG, Actor-Critic, A2C, A3C, TRPO and PPO methods. We also discuss the important Stable Baseline library to implement all those algorithms on different environments in OpenAI Gym, like Atari and others.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6- Finally, we explore the model-based family of RL methods, and importantly, differentiating model-based RL from planning, and exploring the whole spectrum of RL methods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully, you enjoy this course, and find it useful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"Arabic","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/reinforcement-learning-coursat/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5048136_a250_2.jpg","duration":"8 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"4,047.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Machine Learning Researchers","Machine Learning Engineers","Data Scientists"],"tags":["Reinforcement Learning"],"rating":{"count":50,"averageValue":"4.5"},"instructors":[{"name":"Coursat.ai Dr. Ahmad ElSallab","url":"/user/coursatai/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.527027}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"8B94C0206A1C476777D3","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"3 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/deployment-of-machine-learning-models-l/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4833004,"title":"Deployment of Machine Learning Models","shortDescription":"Deployment of Machine Learning Models","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EThis course is for AI and ML Engineers, Practitioners and Researchers who already built an awesome Deep Learning model, and they have a great idea for an app. But they discovered that it is not straight forward to deploy their model in a production App. Another example, say you want to build a robot that uses the Camera sensor to perceive the surrounding environment, build a map of it and eventually navigate it.

In our journey, we will be mostly concerned with how to represent the language tokens, being at the word or character level, and and how to represent their aggregation, like sentences or documents, in a semantically sound way. We start the journey by going through the traditional pipeline of text pre-processing and the different text features like binary and TF-IDF\u0026nbsp;features with the Bag-of-Words model. Then we will dive into the concepts of word vectors and embeddings as a general deep learning concept, with detailed discussion of famous word embedding techniques like word2vec, GloVe, Fasttext and ELMo. This will enable us to divert into recommender systems, using collaborative filtering and twin-tower model as an example of the generic usage of embeddings beyond word representations. In the second part of the course, we will be concerned with sentence and sequence representations. We will tackle the core NLP of Langauge Modeling, at statistical and neural levels, using recurrent models, like LSTM\u0026nbsp;and GRU.

To run a business at optimal capacity, you need to reduce or eliminate waste from processes and improve production flow. In this course, you\u0027ll learn about Lean strategies to reduce waste by determining which operations add value and which don\u0027t. You\u0027ll explore the concept of continuous flow, and discover how to balance work processes to make production flow more efficient. You\u0027ll define what waste is, where it exists, and what causes it.

And in any business, one of the heaviest drains on profitability is waste. Lean waste can come in the form of time, material, and labor. But it may also be related to the utilization of skill-sets as well as poor planning. In lean manufacturing, waste is any expense or effort that is expended but which does not transform raw materials into an item the customer is willing to pay for. By optimizing process steps and eliminating waste, the only true value is added at each phase of production.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday, the Lean Manufacturing model recognizes 8 types of waste within an operation; seven originally conceived when the Toyota Production System was first conceived, and an eighth added when the lean methodology was adopted within the Western World.

In this course, we will cover three main parts. The first part covers the essentials of traditional computer vision pipeline, and how to deal with images in OpenCV and Pillow libraries, including the image pre-processing pipeline like:\u0026nbsp; thresholding, denoising, blurring, filtering, edge detection,\u0026nbsp; contours...etc. We will build simple apps like Car License Plate Detection (LPD) and activity recogntion. This will lead us to the revolution that deep learning brought to the game of computer vision, turning traditional filters into learnable parameters using Convolution Neural Networks. We will cover all the basics of ConvNets, including the details of the Vanilla architecture for image classification, hyper parameters like kernels, strides, maxpool and feature maps sizes calculations. Beyond the Vanilla architecture, we also cover the state-of-the art ConvNet meta-architectures and design patters, like skip-connnections, Inception, DenseNet...etc. In the second part, we will learn how to use ConvNets to solve practical problems in different situations, with small amount of data, how to use transfer learning and the different scenarios for that, and finally how to debug and visualize the leant kernels in ConvNets. In the last part, we will learn about different CV\u0026nbsp;apps using ConvNets. We will learn about the Encoder-Decoder design pattern. We start by the task of semantic segmentation, where we will build a U-Net architecture from scratch for the Cambridge Video (CAMVID) dataset. Then we will learn about Object Detection, covering both 2-stage and one-shot architectures like SSD and YOLO. Next, we will learn how to deal with the video data using the Spatio-Temporal ConvNet architectures. Finally we will introduce 3D Deep Learning to extend ConvNets usage to deal with 3D data, like LiDAR data.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"Arabic","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/deep-learning-for-computer-vision/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4661416_29ea.jpg","duration":"10 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"4,235.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Beginner level computer vision engineer"],"tags":["Deep Learning"],"rating":{"count":173,"averageValue":"4.8"},"instructors":[{"name":"Coursat.ai Dr. Ahmad ElSallab","url":"/user/coursatai/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.8030305}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"9D7D0EE0B2995DD39FA0","originalPrice":"\u20B92,599","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"3 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/az-104-microsoft-azure-hands-on-labs/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4985536,"title":"AZ-104 - Microsoft Azure Hands On Labs","shortDescription":"Cloud Computing with Microsoft Azure","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAbout Me\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy journey began in 2020, after successfully passing my AWS Solutions Architect Exam.

There is a BIG difference in the way these two types of results are ranked. With organic search results, there are many more ranking factors that you will need to consider if you want to perform well in search. When it comes to paid results, advertisers are ranked according to the amount they\u2019ll pay a single visitor, sent to them through Google\u2019s Pay Per Click Ad\u2019s network. The more they are willing to pay the higher they will rank. It\u2019s as simple as that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrganic search doesn\u2019t work in the same way. You can\u2019t pay your way to the top. Instead, you need to optimise your site, pages, and content so you score highly in Google\u2019s ranking algorithm. The good news is, when people search for information on a topic, most people trust organic search results FAR more than they trust paid results.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this video, we\u2019ll be focusing solely on organic results, and giving you tips and advice you can use to perform well in organic Google search.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy do you need SEO?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch engines will be one of the main sources of traffic to your webpage and Google is the biggest and most popular search engine, by far.

Almost every mobile apps require a backend to persist, store it\u2019s data and microservices. Learning different framework is time consuming, learning curve may differ significantly. Wouldn\u2019t that be wonderful if you are introduced with the two most demanding framwork from scratch in a single course? That\u2019s why you are here and this course is just for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlutter and Spring Boot are two big frameworks, getting skilled in each environment requires time. Combining these two in a single course was a bit challenging. Besides, putting more features from both the framework in the course could increase it\u2019s length and could be a burden. For this reason, I have put minimum but most basic features from both the framework and tried to build an app by leveraging the power of both of them. By taking this course, you will have a better and strong understanding in both Flutter and Spring Boot. Besides, Dart and Java have many similarities between them. This will give you an advantage to learn both the languages in parallel. I hope you will get the best out of this course, you will learn how to build Flutter apps from scratch and also how to make a RESTFul service with Spring Boot. You will start as a beginner, and at the end of the course, you will be confident enough to go beyond your capabilities by yourself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe will build one single project throughout this course, and that will be a Bus Ticket Booking or Seat Reservation app where app users will search for different routes on a specific day he/she wants to travel, select the suitable schedule, select one or more seats and then submit the reservation. We will have an Admin for our app whose responsibility is to add bus, routes and schedules. We will provide authentication functionalities for our Admin, we will talk about how we can secure our data or end points and authorization, that means, what kind of data our users can access or not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough I will start from scratch, assuming you have no prior knowledge in Flutter and Spring Boot, I strongly recommend you to have a little basic knowledge of Dart and Java programming language to get a smoother experience from this course. If you don\u2019t have any experience in Dart and Java, I suggest you to follow any YouTube channel to learn the basics of Dart and Java before you get to start this course. I have been always careful to keep the length of this course as short as possible. It is observed that long courses fails to keep their audiences till the end. You probably have bought other courses but never been able to reach the end. I want my students to have a smooth journey that ends with satisfaction and a bag full of skills and knowledge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0026nbsp;hope you will enjoy this course and it will add greater values to your skill.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/flutter-with-spring-boot-crash-course/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5118438_dc3e.jpg","duration":"17 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"4,878.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["For beginner Flutter developers who wants to learn Spring Boot from scratch","For Flutter developers who want to explore and try Spring Boot for their backend project","For Spring Boot developers who want to connect their Spring Boot project with Mobile devices and build beautiful UIs using Flutter"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":65,"averageValue":"4.8"},"instructors":[{"name":"Syed Tanvir Ahmad","url":"/user/bonny-ahmad/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.792308}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"FWSBCC12082023FO","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"\u20B9449","expirationText":"5 hours","discountPercentage":44}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/generative-ai-english-version-unleashing-next-gen-ai/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5273846,"title":"Generative AI (English Version): Unleashing Next-Gen AI","shortDescription":"Generative AI - English version","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EHello and Welcome to a new Journey in the vast area of Generative AI\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGenerative AI is changing our definition of the way of interacting with machines, mobiles and computers.
