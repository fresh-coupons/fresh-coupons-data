When employees feel that their concerns are addressed, their contributions are recognized, and they are treated fairly, they are more likely to be engaged.","2. Holistic Approach to HR Management:  Combining employee relations and engagement in one course allows for a more comprehensive understanding of how to manage and motivate employees. It enables HR professionals to see the bigger picture of how managing relationships directly impacts engagement levels, and how engaged employees contribute to better employee relations.","3. Strategies for Improvement:  Discussing both topics together allows for the exploration of strategies that improve both employee relations and engagement simultaneously. For example, open communication channels and conflict resolution mechanisms can enhance both relations and engagement. Recognizing and rewarding employees also strengthens both areas.","4. Efficiency in Learning:  Since both employee relations and engagement involve overlapping areas of HR practice, addressing them in a single course makes learning more efficient. HR professionals can gain insights into how improving one area can positively impact the other, leading to a more integrated approach to workforce management.","5. Practical Application:  A combined course can provide practical tools and frameworks that address both employee relations and engagement. For example, a module on conflict resolution might not only teach how to resolve disputes but also how to turn those resolutions into opportunities for increasing employee engagement.","6. Organizational Culture and Performance:  The course can help participants understand how both employee relations and engagement contribute to building a positive organizational culture. A strong culture, in turn, enhances performance, reduces turnover, and makes the organization a more attractive place to work.  In summary, discussing employee relations and employee engagement together in one online course provides a more complete understanding of how to create a positive, productive, and motivated workforce. By learning about both areas in tandem, HR professionals can develop strategies that support a healthy work environment and drive organizational success."],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":222,"averageValue":"4.5"},"instructors":[{"name":"MTF Institute of Management, Technology and Finance","url":"/user/mtfinstitute/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.58}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"CB1EFB71A43B8F0FCF9D","originalPrice":"\u20B91,339","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"2 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/certificate-of-leadership-excellence-in-business-management/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":6180625,"title":"Certificate of Leadership Excellence in Business Management","shortDescription":"Leadership, Management, Vision and Strategic Thinking, Team Building and Motivation, Communication and Influence","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWelcome to program: Certificate of Leadership Excellence in Business Management\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECourse provided by \u003Cstrong\u003EMTF Institute of Management, Technology and Finance\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMTF\u003C/strong\u003E is the global educational and research institute with HQ at Lisbon, Portugal, focused on business \u0026amp; professional hybrid (on-campus and online) education at areas: Business \u0026amp; Administration, Science \u0026amp; Technology, Banking \u0026amp; Finance. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMTF R\u0026amp;D \u003C/strong\u003Ecenter focused on research activities at areas: Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Data Science, Big Data, WEB3, Blockchain, Cryptocurrency \u0026amp; Digital Assets, Metaverses, Digital Transformation, Fintech, Electronic Commerce, Internet of Things. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMTF\u003C/strong\u003E is the official partner of: IBM, Intel, Microsoft, member of the Portuguese Chamber of Commerce and Industry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMTF \u003C/strong\u003Eis present in 213 countries and has been chosen by more than 560 000 students.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECourse Author:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDr. Joao Martins\u003C/strong\u003E is seasoned manager and entrepreneur, with over 30 years\u2019 experience in top management positions in the telecommunications and IT sectors.

It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables.

DNA template is denatured to single strands.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. DNA primer (with 3\u2019 end near sequence of interest) is annealed to \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe template DNA and extended with DNA polymerase.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Four reactions are set up, each containing:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. DNA template\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Primer annealed to template DNA\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.

Next, a different radio-labeled dideoxynucleotide (ddATP, ddTTP, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EddCTP, or ddGTP) is added to each of the four reaction tubes at \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1/100th the concentration of normal dNTPs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. ddNTPs possess a 3\u2019-H instead of 3\u2019-OH, compete in the reaction with \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enormal dNTPS, and produce no phosphodiester bond.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Whenever the radio-labeled ddNTPs are incorporated in the chain, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDNA synthesis terminates.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Each of the four reaction mixtures produces a population of DNA \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emolecules with DNA chains terminating at all possible positions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. Extension products in each of the four reaction mixutes\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ealso end with a different radio-labeled ddNTP\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(depending on the base).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9.

Automated DNA sequencing employs the same general \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eprocedure, but uses ddNTPs labeled with fluorescent dyes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Combine 4 dyes in one reaction tube and electrophores in \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eone lane on a polyacrylamide gel or capillary containing \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Epolyacrylamide.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. UV laser detects dyes and reads the sequence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5.
