At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E*\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E javascript course contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript introduction\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript array\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript variables\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript functions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript objects\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript control statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript cookies\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript loop statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript data structures\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript error handling\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript regular expressions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003Esection 3- learn PHP\u0026nbsp;programming language\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis section will learn the basic structure of a web application and how a web browser interacts with a web server.

Zero trust architectures simplify network infrastructure, make users happier, and keep cyberthreats at a distance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince John Kindervag, then at Forrester Research, coined the phrase, zero trust architectures follow the maxim \u0022never trust, always verify.\u0022 To block inappropriate access and lateral movement throughout an environment, zero trust architecture enforces access policies based on context\u2014including the user\u0027s role and location, the device they\u0027re using, and the data they\u0027re asking for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA zero trust architecture means you know who\u0027s using what, and you can track it, including encrypted traffic; you need to monitor and verify the traffic between parts of the environment; and you need multifactor authentication (MFA) that goes beyond passwords.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn important thing to remember is that in a zero trust architecture, a resource\u0027s location isn\u0027t as important as before.

By enabling parameters to dictate access and restrictions, the Zero Trust model views data security from a whole new perspective. As opposed to legacy networks that have little to no visibility or control over network and data usage, Zero Trust Architectures see all network traffic through segmentation gateways with granular policies governing access to data, apps, and assets.

The World Wide Web Consortium\u0027s XML 1.0 Specification of 1998 and several other related specifications - all of them free open standards - define XML. The design goals of XML emphasize simplicity, generality, and usability across the Internet. It is a textual data format with strong support via Unicode for different human languages. Although the design of XML focuses on documents, the language is widely used for the representation of arbitrary data structures such as those used in web services. Several schema systems exist to aid in the definition of XML-based languages, while programmers have developed many application programming interfaces (APIs) to aid the processing of XML data.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u0022\u003Cstrong\u003EXSD\u003C/strong\u003E (\u003Cstrong\u003EXML Schema Definition\u003C/strong\u003E), a recommendation of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), specifies how to formally describe the elements in an Extensible Markup Language (XML) document. It can be used by programmers to verify each piece of item content in a document. They can check if it adheres to the description of the element it is placed in. Like all XML schema languages, XSD can be used to express a set of rules to which an XML document must conform in order to be considered \u0022valid\u0022 according to that schema. However, unlike most other schema languages, XSD was also designed with the intent that determination of a document\u0027s validity would produce a collection of information adhering to specific data types. Such a post-validation \u003Cem\u003Einfoset\u003C/em\u003E can be useful in the development of XML document processing software.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat you\u0027ll learn from this course:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E- You will learn all the theory about how to use XML language correctly, as well as all about its general and specific syntaxes, according to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) official recommendations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- You will learn all the practice about how to code your XML files, using the elements, attributes and types - default and custom ones - from the referred XSD schemas, as well as how to test the correctness and validation of your XML instances against their referred XSD docs using Eclipse IDE automation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- You will adventure into the complete theory background about how to create your own XSD schema documents and master the details about XSD general and specific syntaxes, according to W3C official specifications.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- You will practice, through tens of examples, how to code your own XSD files, using the 3 design methods suggested by W3C, as well as how to take advantage of all main base elements, attributes and types (default W3C library/namespace) to create your own personalized XML/XSD components.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- You will have pretty clear what default and custom namespaces are, as well as prefixes, both at the XML instances as at the XSD documents. You\u0027ll learn how to import and include multiple XSD documents into one same XSD and also how to refer to multiple XSD documents from one same XML instance, nice and easy... even using your own personal brand as the prefix for customizing your code (in my case: danielpm1982).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- All this course\u0027s theory, as well as the good practices and techniques used, are based on the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and W3Schools contents, here with much better and complete explanations and practical examples.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- After doing this course, you\u0027ll understand much easier all the document types used at Web Services development, or any other application that uses XML and XSD (or WSDL).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- All source codes are available at my GitHub, as well as attached to each practice lecture, as a zip file. You can easily download, study, reuse and test them yourself, for learning purposes, and even create much better examples. This is how you learn: starting from the basics and evolving, through practicing, until proficiency. All at your own pace and time and re-watching any lecture as many times as you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Additional content, as WSDL and JSON theory and practical lectures, as well as lectures with sample Web Services projects, demonstrating the real world applicability of XML, XSD, WSDL and JSON, will be added incrementally within the next months, at this same course. But you can finish this course with the current content, as it is, and receive your Udemy Certification on that\u2026 and if you want, you may return later, watch the future extra content lectures (WSDL and JSON) and, at the end, receive another Udemy Certification with the updated content and course name. All students will be notified when any future content is added.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- This course is already composed of more than 10 hours, a workload greater than almost all other same-topic courses at Udemy.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPrerequisites:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E- If you wanna practice, you should have Eclipse IDE installed on your PC or notebook. But you can just watch the theory and practical lectures, at any device with internet access, in case you have no computer available at that moment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- No programming languages or frameworks are required for this course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- No silly or useless tests will be imposed onto you. You will know you got the content right when you implement your own code and test it successfully, as done at our practical lectures. Simple as that and with no pressure!\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhom this course is for ?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E- Any human being who wishes to learn XML and XSD for future use in any of their many market applications, specially at, but not limited to, Web Services development.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat are the references of this course ?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E- The main reference source is the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which is the creator and worldwide maintainer of the specifications (REC) of XML language and related technologies (XSD, WSDL, etc). All related links, with W3C content, are attached to each theory lecture description.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat\u0027s the difference between taking this course and simply viewing W3Schools material at their own site ?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/strong\u003EAlthough the content is almost entirely referenced on W3C publications, this course offers much better, organized and understandable explanations about the content, and also a much greater set of examples, using Eclipse IDE, from the easiest to the most complex ones. At W3Schools site, for instance, you only find very simple snippets of code.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat\u0027s the difference between taking this course and the other XML/XSD courses at Udemy ?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E- No objection at all to those who may take more than one course. But this one has an innovative methodology, is more organized and complete (over 10 hours of theory and practices already), as well as it has much better examples, explained step by step, without any hurried 2-3 min lectures. It covers IN FULL everything that W3C suggests about XML and XSD.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- This course is organized similar to university or college lectures, with an average of 1h per lecture. The organization is oriented towards the content itself and not short time limited lectures. I think prioritizing the content on the curriculum organization contributes way better to cohesiveness as well as to the organization and consolidation of the content in anyone\u0027s brain. 2-3 min classes end up being a big confusion resulted from a too high fragmentation level of the content. Students always criticize on other courses that everything\u0027s too hastily delivered, as if the students already knew the subjects. Here, and differently from that, you\u0027ll see it\u0027s all nicely and easily delivered, and you won\u0027t get lost on the content, even if you never heard about XML or any structural or programming language before. You\u0027re free, though, to plan your own individual learning schedule. Just take note of the subject you last saw, and then continue from there when you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Finally, this course is divided into Theory and Practice lectures. You\u0027ll, thus, have multiple chances, from multiple explanation perspectives, to learn or complement the acknowledging of each topic, subtopics, practices, and so on. And, of course, at your own time, pace and individual needs. The access to this course will be forever yours (it doesn\u0027t expire) and you\u0027ll be able to review any lecture as much as you want. A big advantage of e-learning recorded lectures compared to live face-to-face attendance lectures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWelcome to the course !!

Ethical hacking and penetration testing are ethical approaches to identifying vulnerabilities and strengthening defenses. Certification programs like CISSP, CompTIA Security\u002B, and Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) validate one\u0027s proficiency in this field. Familiarity with tools like Kali Linux and Cisco CCNA also adds value to a cyber security specialist\u0027s repertoire.

Performance goals are specific targets or objectives that individuals or teams are expected to achieve within a given timeframe.

We will explore the significance of performance goals in the realm of human resources and the benefits they bring to both employees and organizations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Clarity and Focus: Performance goals provide clarity and direction to employees. When employees have clear goals, they know what is expected of them and can focus their efforts on achieving those objectives.

Motivation and Engagement: Well-defined performance goals have a motivational effect on employees. When employees have challenging yet attainable goals, they are more likely to feel engaged and motivated to perform at their best. Goals create a sense of purpose and provide a framework for employees to channel their energy and expertise towards achieving desired outcomes. They can enhance job satisfaction and increase employee commitment to the organization.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Performance Evaluation: Performance goals serve as a basis for assessing employee performance. By setting clear objectives, managers can evaluate and measure the progress and achievements of employees. Regular performance evaluations help identify areas of improvement, provide constructive feedback, and recognize top performers. Objective evaluation criteria linked to performance goals ensure fairness and transparency in the assessment process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Skill Development: Performance goals create opportunities for employees to develop and enhance their skills and competencies. By setting goals that require employees to stretch beyond their current capabilities, organizations can foster a culture of continuous learning and development. Employees are motivated to acquire new knowledge, acquire relevant training, and seek growth opportunities to meet or exceed their goals. This, in turn, benefits both the individual and the organization by building a skilled and capable workforce.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Alignment with Organizational Objectives: Performance goals play a crucial role in aligning individual and team efforts with the broader organizational objectives. When goals are set in line with the strategic priorities of the organization, employees understand how their work contributes to the overall success of the company. This alignment promotes a sense of organizational unity and helps employees see the bigger picture, fostering a collective effort towards achieving organizational goals. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Accountability and Performance Improvement: Performance goals create a sense of accountability among employees. When employees have clear goals and know they will be evaluated based on their performance, they are more likely to take ownership of their work and strive for excellence.

Wondering how? I will tell you how\u2026 but before that let me remind you how often you negotiate in life. From childhood, you must have practiced the art of negotiation \u2013 Bedtime, a treat, a promotion, a raise, an extended deadline. Yet you are not good at negotiations. Why? Does it demand a different level of intellect and expertise? Well, I will say \u201CNo\u201D to the former and \u201CYes\u201D to the latter. There are some techniques and a process when put into practice enable you to save thousands of dollars, but unfortunately, no one has told you about these techniques yet, and hence, you are missing out.

On a personal level, we negotiate with friends, family, landlords, car sellers, and employers, among others. We come across hundreds of situations that put our negotiation skills to the test. Whether buying a house or car, reviewing your salary with your boss, or deliberating contracts for your business, your success in each of\u003Cstrong\u003E \u003C/strong\u003Ethese activities will be heavily dependent on your ability to negotiate. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut how come I am speaking so highly of negotiation skills?

And now, I want my learnings to benefit you so that you don\u2019t need to chart the long road which I have trodden.
