The goal of computer forensics is to perform a structured investigation and maintain a documented chain of evidence to find out exactly what happened on a computing device and who was responsible for it. Computer forensics -- which is sometimes referred to as computer forensic science essentially is data recovery with legal compliance guidelines to make the information admissible in legal proceedings. The terms digital forensics and cyber forensics are often used as synonyms for computer forensics. Digital forensics starts with the collection of information in a way that maintains its integrity. Investigators then analyze the data or system to determine if it was changed, how it was changed and who made the changes. The use of computer forensics isn\u0027t always tied to a crime. The forensic process is also used as part of data recovery processes to gather data from a crashed server, failed drive, reformatted operating system (OS) or other situation where a system has unexpectedly stopped working.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy is computer forensics important?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the civil and criminal justice system, computer forensics helps ensure the integrity of digital evidence presented in court cases.

The CRISPR-Cas9 system consists of two key molecules that introduce a change (mutation) into the DNA. These are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u2981\tan enzyme called Cas9. This acts as a pair of \u2018molecular scissors\u2019 that can cut the two strands of DNA at a specific location in the genome so that bits of DNA can then be added or removed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u2981\ta piece of RNA called guide RNA (gRNA). This consists of a small piece of pre-designed RNA sequence located within a longer RNA scaffold. The scaffold part binds to DNA and the pre-designed sequence \u2018guides\u2019 Cas9 to the right part of the genome. This makes sure that the Cas9 enzyme cuts at the right point in the genome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The guide RNA is designed to find and bind to a specific sequence in the DNA. The guide RNA has RNA bases that are complementary to those of the target DNA sequence in the genome. This means that, at least in theory, the guide RNA will only bind to the target sequence and no other regions of the genome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. The Cas9 follows the guide RNA to the same location in the DNA sequence and makes a cut across both strands of the DNA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. At this stage the cell recognizes that the DNA is damaged and tries to repair it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5.

However, they had no way of controlling where in the genome the mutation would occur.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor several years scientists have been using \u2018gene targeting\u2019 to introduce changes in specific places in the genome, by removing or adding either whole genes or single bases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETraditional gene targeting has been very valuable for studying genes and genetics, however it takes a long time to create a mutation and is fairly expensive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeveral \u2018gene editing\u2019 technologies have recently been developed to improve gene targeting methods, including CRISPR-Cas systems, transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) and zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe CRISPR-Cas9 system currently stands out as the fastest, cheapest and most reliable system for \u2018editing\u2019 genes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat are the applications and implications?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECRISPR-Cas9 has a lot of potential as a tool for treating a range of medical conditions that have a genetic component, including cancer, hepatitis B or even high cholesterol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany of the proposed applications involve editing the genomes of somatic (non-reproductive) cells but there has been a lot of interest in and debate about the potential to edit germline (reproductive) cells.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause any changes made in germline cells will be passed on from generation to generation it has important ethical implications.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECarrying out gene editing in germline cells is currently illegal in the UK and most other countries.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy contrast, the use of CRISPR-Cas9 and other gene editing technologies in somatic cells is uncontroversial.

HR professionals can gain insights into how improving one area can positively impact the other, leading to a more integrated approach to workforce management.","5. Practical Application:  A combined course can provide practical tools and frameworks that address both employee relations and engagement. For example, a module on conflict resolution might not only teach how to resolve disputes but also how to turn those resolutions into opportunities for increasing employee engagement.","6. Organizational Culture and Performance:  The course can help participants understand how both employee relations and engagement contribute to building a positive organizational culture. A strong culture, in turn, enhances performance, reduces turnover, and makes the organization a more attractive place to work.  In summary, discussing employee relations and employee engagement together in one online course provides a more complete understanding of how to create a positive, productive, and motivated workforce. By learning about both areas in tandem, HR professionals can develop strategies that support a healthy work environment and drive organizational success."],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":87,"averageValue":"4.3"},"instructors":[{"name":"MTF Institute of Management, Technology and Finance","url":"/user/mtfinstitute/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.36}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"D4A7A0F13C29850F2B31","originalPrice":"\u20B91,799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"3 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/git-gitlab-github-fundamentals-for-software-developers/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":6131097,"title":"GIT, GitLab, GitHub Fundamentals for Software Developers","shortDescription":"GIT, GitLab, GitHub Fundamentals for Software Developers, Basics of Work, Command Line, GUI, Intro to GIT for Beginners","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWelcome to program: GIT, GitLab, GitHub Fundamentals for Software Developers\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGIT, GitLab, GitHub Fundamentals for Software Developers, Basics of work, Command Line \u0026amp; GUI, Intro to GIT for Beginners\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECourse provided by \u003Cstrong\u003EMTF Institute of Management, Technology and Finance\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMTF\u003C/strong\u003E is the global educational and research institute with HQ at Lisbon, Portugal, focused on business \u0026amp; professional hybrid (on-campus and online) education at areas: Business \u0026amp; Administration, Science \u0026amp; Technology, Banking \u0026amp; Finance. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMTF R\u0026amp;D \u003C/strong\u003Ecenter focused on research activities at areas: Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Data Science, Big Data, WEB3, Blockchain, Cryptocurrency \u0026amp; Digital Assets, Metaverses, Digital Transformation, Fintech, Electronic Commerce, Internet of Things. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMTF\u003C/strong\u003E is the official partner of: IBM, Intel, Microsoft, member of the Portuguese Chamber of Commerce and Industry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMTF \u003C/strong\u003Eis present in 210 countries and has been chosen by more than 520 000 students.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EImportance of Git Skills for Software Developers and Effective Software Development at Enterprise Companies\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMastering Git, particularly in conjunction with platforms like GitLab and GitHub, is crucial for software developers and the overall success of software development within enterprise companies.
