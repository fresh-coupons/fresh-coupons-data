In either case, congratulations on selecting one of the most fast-paced segments of the automotive industry. Working with the electrical systems can be challenging, yet very rewarding; however, it can also be very frustrating at times. For many people, learning electrical systems can be a struggle. It is my hope that I am able to present the course to you in such a manner that you will not only understand electrical systems, but will excel at it. There are many ways the theory of electricity can be explained, and many metaphors can be used. Some compare electricity to a water flow, while others explain it in a purely scientific fashion. Everyone learns differently. I am presenting electrical theory in a manner that I hope will be clear and concise. If you do not fully comprehend a concept, then it is important to discuss it with your instructor. Electricity is somewhat abstract; so if you do have questions, be sure to ask me in Udemy ask section.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy Become an Electrical System Technician? \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the past, it was possible for technicians to work their entire careers and be able to almost completely avoid the vehicle\u2019s electrical systems. They would specialize in engines, steering/ suspension, or brakes. Today, there is not a system on the vehicle that is immune to the role of electrical circuits. Engine controls, electronic suspension systems, and anti-lock brakes are common on today\u2019s vehicles. Even electrical systems that were once thought of as being simple have evolved to computer controls. Headlights are now pulse-width modulated using high side drivers and will automatically brighten and dim based on the light intensity of oncoming traffic. Today\u2019s vehicles are equipped with twenty or more computers, laser-guided cruise control, sonar park assist, infrared climate control, fiber optics, and radio frequency transponders and decoders. Simple systems have become more computers reliant. For example, the horn circuit on the 2008 Chrysler 300C involves three separate control modules to function. Even the tires have computers involved, with the addition of tire pressure monitoring systems!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday\u2019s technician must possess a full and complete electrical background to be able to succeed.

Whenever they dismantle something, they can reassemble it how it was. Whenever they say that they need to investigate the hood, they can really get the darn thing open. Furthermore, when they need to change a level, they don\u0027t endure ten minutes attempting to sort out which end of the raise is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFortunately, you don\u0027t need to be brought into the world with a wrench in your grasp to know how to fix things \u2014 even things as apparently convoluted as a vehicle.

In this module, you will learn how to publish your app to the Google Play Store. You will also explore strategies for app monetization, including in-app purchases\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven though Kotlin is a full-fledged functional programming language, it preserves most of the object-oriented nature of Java as an alternative programming style, which is very handy when converting existing Java code. Kotlin has classes with constructors, along with nested, inner, and anonymous inner classes, and it has interfaces like Java 8. Kotlin does \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E have a new keyword. To create a class instance, call the constructor just like a regular function. We saw that in the screenshot above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKotlin has single inheritance from a named superclass, and all Kotlin classes have a default superclass Any, which is \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E the same as the Java base class java.lang.Object. Any contains only three predefined member functions: equals(), hashCode(), and toString().\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKotlin classes have to be marked with the open keyword in order to allow other classes to inherit from them; Java classes are kind of the opposite, as they are inheritable \u003Cem\u003Eunless\u003C/em\u003E marked with the final keyword. To override a superclass method, the method itself must be marked open, and the subclass method must be marked override. This is all of a piece with Kotlin\u2019s philosophy of making things explicit rather than relying on defaults. In this particular case, I can see where Kotlin\u2019s way of explicitly marking base class members as open for inheritance and derived class members as overrides avoids several kinds of common Java errors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, you\u0027ll learn how to create apps and run them on virtual devices through guided exercises. You\u0027ll cover the fundamentals of Android development, from structuring an app to building out the UI with Activities and Fragments and various navigation patterns. Progressing through the chapters and lectures, you\u0027ll delve into Android\u0027s RecyclerView to make the most of displaying lists of data and become comfortable with fetching data from a web service and handling images. You\u0027ll then learn about mapping, location services, and the permissions model before working with notifications and how to persist data. Moving on, you\u0027ll get to grips with testing, covering the full spectrum of the test pyramid. You\u0027ll also learn how AAC (Android Architecture Components) are used to cleanly structure your code and explore various architecture patterns and the benefits of dependency injection. \u003Cem\u003EThe core libraries of RxJava and Coroutines are covered for asynchronous programming\u003C/em\u003E. The focus then returns to the UI, demonstrating how to add motion and transitions when users interact with your apps. Towards the end, you\u0027ll build an interesting app to retrieve and display popular movies from a movie database, and then see how to publish your apps on Google Play. By the end of this course, you\u0027ll have the skills and confidence needed to build fully-fledged Android apps using Kotlin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre you trying to start a career in Android programming, but haven\u0027t found the right way in?

If so, then this course is for you\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen Android first arrived in 2008, it was a bit drab compared to the much more stylish iOS on the Apple iPhone/iPad. But, quite quickly, through a variety of handset offers that struck a chord with practical, price-conscious consumers, as well as those who are fashion-conscious and tech-savvy, Android user numbers exploded. For many, myself included, developing for Android is the most rewarding pastime and business, bar none. Quickly putting together a prototype of an idea, refining it, and then deciding to run with it and wire it up into a fully-fledged app, is such an exciting and rewarding process. Any programming can be fun \u2013 I have been programming all my life \u2013 but creating for Android is somehow extraordinarily rewarding..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKotlin is the most succinct language, and therefore is the least error-prone, \u003Cem\u003Ewhich is great for beginners\u003C/em\u003E. Kotlin is also the most fun language, mainly because the succinctness means you can get results faster and with less code. Google considers Kotlin an official (first-class) Android language. There are some other advantages to Kotlin that make it less error-prone and less likely to make mistakes that cause crashes. We will discover the details of these advantages as we proceed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKotlin is an object-oriented language. This means that it uses the concept of reusable programming objects.

The goal of computer forensics is to perform a structured investigation and maintain a documented chain of evidence to find out exactly what happened on a computing device and who was responsible for it. Computer forensics -- which is sometimes referred to as computer forensic science essentially is data recovery with legal compliance guidelines to make the information admissible in legal proceedings. The terms digital forensics and cyber forensics are often used as synonyms for computer forensics. Digital forensics starts with the collection of information in a way that maintains its integrity. Investigators then analyze the data or system to determine if it was changed, how it was changed and who made the changes. The use of computer forensics isn\u0027t always tied to a crime.

It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E*\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E javascript course contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript introduction\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript array\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript variables\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript functions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript objects\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript control statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003Esection 4- learn PHP\u0026nbsp;programming language\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis section will learn the basic structure of a web application and how a web browser interacts with a web server.
