It quickly progresses to intermediate then advanced levels of playing. First begin with universal shapes found in every key of music to expertly play scales and leads on the entire fretboard. Don t worry about memorizing these positions! Memory will come naturally when Marko Coconut demonstrates how to use these scales musically. Tasty licks, tricks and techniques like hammer ons, pull offs, picking patterns, vibrato, string bending, two hand tapping. Plus techniques exclusive to electric guitar including tremolo bar, string bending, and electronic control tricks. In addition you will learn a ton of applications to make your lead guitar and melody lines stand out, and make learning your favorite songs a breeze: increment patterns, string skipping, double note patterns (harmony), two handed tapping, harmonics. All of this and more is introduced in a song context, giving thorough examples of how these scales, techniques and applications can be used with chords and song structure. To wrap up this amazing instructional DVD, Mark teaches you all of the modes, key changes, plus 50 exotic and cultural scales all on the entire fretboard! You ll be amazed at how expertly Mark John Sternal has simplified the art of understanding and using the guitar fretboard. New Features Include - Pick and fretboard hand close ups - Note charts in addition to traditional notation and TAB - Music and song examples - Two speed examples (slow and fast, progressively increased) - Bonus beginner section - Ascending and descending scales, techniques and applications - Examples for all popular styles of music: Rock, Jazz, Blues, Country, Metal\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/shred-the-fretboard-guitar-master-course/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/6118247_5de8.jpg","duration":"4 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"1,013.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Beginner through advanced guitarists."],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":2,"averageValue":"4.6"},"instructors":[{"name":"Marko \u0022Coconut\u0022 Sternal","url":"/user/mark-sternal/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.5}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"BEB88555B67497491221","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"\u20B9399","expirationText":"2 days","discountPercentage":50}}},"freeCourses":{"https://www.udemy.com/course/aspen-plus-course/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":6935721,"title":"Aspen Plus V14 - Shell and Tube Heat Exchangers","shortDescription":"Learn step-by-step how to simulate, design, and rate shell-and-tube heat exchangers using Aspen Plus V14 and EDR.","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EThis course is designed for engineers, students, and professionals who want to master the practical use of \u003Cstrong\u003EAspen Plus V14\u003C/strong\u003E and \u003Cstrong\u003EAspen Exchanger Design \u0026amp; Rating (EDR)\u003C/strong\u003E for the simulation, design, and rating of \u003Cstrong\u003Eshell-and-tube heat exchangers\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou will learn everything from the fundamentals of heat exchangers to building a complete thermal simulation, specifying operating conditions, configuring geometry, and generating professional engineering reports.
