There is no general consensus about its exact scope or epistemological status.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of mathematical activity consists of discovering and proving (by pure reasoning) properties of abstract objects. These objects are either abstractions from nature (such as natural numbers or lines), or (in modern mathematics) abstract entities of which certain properties, called axioms, are stipulated. A proof consists of a succession of applications of some deductive rules to already known results, including previously proved theorems, axioms and (in case of abstraction from nature) some basic properties that are considered as true starting points of the theory under consideration. The result of a proof is called a \u003Cem\u003Etheorem\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMathematics is widely used in science for modeling phenomena. This enables the extraction of quantitative predictions from experimental laws. For example, the movement of planets can be predicted with high accuracy using Newton\u0027s law of gravitation combined with mathematical computation. The independence of mathematical truth from any experimentation implies that the accuracy of such predictions depends only on the adequacy of the model for describing the reality. So when some inaccurate predictions arise, it means that the model must be improved or changed, not that the mathematics is wrong. For example, the perihelion precession of Mercury cannot be explained by Newton\u0027s law of gravitation, but is accurately explained by Einstein\u0027s general relativity. This experimental validation of Einstein\u0027s theory shows that Newton\u0027s law of gravitation is only an approximation (which still is very accurate in everyday life).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMathematics is essential in many fields, including natural sciences, engineering, medicine, finance, computer science and social sciences. Some areas of mathematics, such as statistics and game theory, are developed in direct correlation with their applications, and are often grouped under the name of applied mathematics. Other mathematical areas are developed independently from any application (and are therefore called pure mathematics), but practical applications are often discovered later. A fitting example is the problem of integer factorization, which goes back to Euclid, but which had no practical application before its use in the RSA cryptosystem (for the security of computer networks).\u003C/p\u003E","language":"Ingl\u00E9s","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/mathematics-math-class-9-practical-tests-and-answers/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4539922_cc1f.jpg","duration":"199 questions","enrolledStudentsCount":"2.056 estudiantes","lastUpdated":"Fecha de la \u00FAltima actualizaci\u00F3n: 2/2022","targetAudiences":["Students of 9 class","Teachers","Fathers and mothers / Parents","Kids"],"tags":["Ense\u00F1anzas y disciplinas acad\u00E9micas","Matem\u00E1ticas","Matem\u00E1ticas"],"rating":null,"instructors":[{"name":"SMARTER ACADEMY","url":"/user/haytham-hesham-elsayed-hashem-elmousalami/","totalNumberOfStudents":181506,"totalNumberOfReviews":2223,"averageRating":4.232064823465704}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"D79CCF44BF9690118E01","originalPrice":"\u20B912.800","discountedPrice":"Gratuito","expirationText":"4 dias","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/miller-analogies-test-mat-top-practical-questions/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":3867242,"title":"2022 Miller Analogies Test (MAT) TOP Practical Questions","shortDescription":"97% Pass in First Attempt Easily Most Common Miller Analogies Test (MAT) professional Questions with your hand","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHello !\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EMost Common Miller Analogies Test (MAT) professional Questions with your hand\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E97% Pass in First Attempt Easily\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u003Cstrong\u003EMiller Analogies Test\u003C/strong\u003E (\u003Cstrong\u003EMAT\u003C/strong\u003E) is a standardized test used both for graduate school admissions in the United States and entrance to high I.Q. societies.

It is a natural science that covers the elements that make up matter to the compounds composed of atoms, molecules and ions: their composition, structure, properties, behavior and the changes they undergo during a reaction with other substances.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the scope of its subject, chemistry occupies an intermediate position between physics and biology. It is sometimes called the central science because it provides a foundation for understanding both basic and applied scientific disciplines at a fundamental level. For example, chemistry explains aspects of plant chemistry (botany), the formation of igneous rocks (geology), how atmospheric ozone is formed and how environmental pollutants are degraded (ecology), the properties of the soil on the moon (cosmochemistry), how medications work (pharmacology), and how to collect DNA evidence at a crime scene (forensics).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChemistry addresses topics such as how atoms and molecules interact via chemical bonds to form new chemical compounds. There are two types of chemical bonds: 1. primary chemical bonds e.g covalent bonds, in which atoms share one or more electron(s); ionic bonds, in which an atom donates one or more electrons to another atom to produce ions (cations and anions); metallic bonds and 2. secondary chemical bonds e.g. hydrogen bonds; Van der Waals force bonds, ion-ion interaction, ion-dipole interaction etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"Ingl\u00E9s","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/school-chemistry-class-12-practical-tests-and-answers/","imageUri":"https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4575244_b901.jpg?secure=j2m8dZtXXeRiXu2ZTPm6_A%3D%3D%2C1646604697","duration":"425 questions","enrolledStudentsCount":"0 estudiantes","lastUpdated":"Publicado el 3/2022","targetAudiences":["Chemistry Lovers","School Students","Teachers","Fathers and mothers / Parents","Kids"],"tags":["Ense\u00F1anzas y disciplinas acad\u00E9micas","Ciencia"],"rating":null,"instructors":[{"name":"SMARTER ACADEMY","url":"/user/haytham-hesham-elsayed-hashem-elmousalami/","totalNumberOfStudents":181506,"totalNumberOfReviews":2223,"averageRating":4.232064823465704}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"3E39FDD430E181D9F7AD","originalPrice":"\u20B912.800","discountedPrice":"Gratuito","expirationText":"4 dias","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/c-programming-practical-tests-top-questions-and-answers-i/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4512932,"title":"C Programming practical tests TOP Questions and answers","shortDescription":"Welcome to The Mother of languages !!

By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions. It has found lasting use in applications previously coded in assembly language. Such applications include operating systems and various application software for computer architectures that range from supercomputers to PLCs and embedded systems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA successor to the programming language \u003Cem\u003EB\u003C/em\u003E, C was originally developed at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie between 1972 and 1973 to construct utilities running on Unix. It was applied to re-implementing the kernel of the Unix operating system. During the 1980s, C gradually gained popularity. It has become one of the most widely used programming languages, with C compilers from various vendors available for the majority of existing computer architectures and operating systems. C has been standardized by ANSI since 1989 (ANSI C) and by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EC is an imperative procedural language. It was designed to be compiled to provide low-level access to memory and language constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions, all with minimal runtime support. Despite its low-level capabilities, the language was designed to encourage cross-platform programming. A standards-compliant C program written with portability in mind can be compiled for a wide variety of computer platforms and operating systems with few changes to its source code.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"Ingl\u00E9s","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/c-programming-practical-tests-top-questions-and-answers-i/","imageUri":"https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4512932_3614.jpg?secure=eVcO0YBWqlb9aWqOJisadg%3D%3D%2C1646604778","duration":"375 questions","enrolledStudentsCount":"5.081 estudiantes","lastUpdated":"Fecha de la \u00FAltima actualizaci\u00F3n: 1/2022","targetAudiences":["Programmers and Coders","Debuggers","Computer science practitioners","Teachers and CEOs","HR and Recruiters","Python and OOPs","Computer science scholars","Web Developers","Data scientists and machine learning engineers","Tech entrepreneurs and CEOs","Web Developers"],"tags":["Inform\u00E1tica y software","Certificaciones de inform\u00E1tica","C (lenguaje de programaci\u00F3n)"],"rating":{"count":5,"averageValue":"3.8"},"instructors":[{"name":"SMARTER ACADEMY","url":"/user/haytham-hesham-elsayed-hashem-elmousalami/","totalNumberOfStudents":181506,"totalNumberOfReviews":2223,"averageRating":4.232064823465704}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"F71BE6C6B3E4004DF2AE","originalPrice":"\u20B912.800","discountedPrice":"Gratuito","expirationText":"4 dias","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/mathematics-math-class-8-practical-tests-and-answers/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4536714,"title":"School Mathematics Math Class 8 Practical Tests and Answers","shortDescription":"Mathematics Math Class 8 Practical Tests and Answers %99 PASS","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESchool Mathematics Math Class 8 Practical Tests and Answers\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMathematics Math Class 8 Practical Tests and Answers %99 PASS\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMathematics\u003C/strong\u003E (from Greek: \u03BC\u03AC\u03B8\u03B7\u03BC\u03B1, \u003Cem\u003Em\u00E1th\u0113ma\u003C/em\u003E, \u0027knowledge, study, learning\u0027) is an area of knowledge, which includes the study of such topics as numbers (arithmetic and number theory), formulas and related structures (algebra), shapes and spaces in which they are contained (geometry), and quantities and their changes (calculus and analysis). There is no general consensus about its exact scope or epistemological status.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of mathematical activity consists of discovering and proving (by pure reasoning) properties of abstract objects. These objects are either abstractions from nature (such as natural numbers or lines), or (in modern mathematics) abstract entities of which certain properties, called axioms, are stipulated. A proof consists of a succession of applications of some deductive rules to already known results, including previously proved theorems, axioms and (in case of abstraction from nature) some basic properties that are considered as true starting points of the theory under consideration. The result of a proof is called a \u003Cem\u003Etheorem\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMathematics is widely used in science for modeling phenomena. This enables the extraction of quantitative predictions from experimental laws. For example, the movement of planets can be predicted with high accuracy using Newton\u0027s law of gravitation combined with mathematical computation. The independence of mathematical truth from any experimentation implies that the accuracy of such predictions depends only on the adequacy of the model for describing the reality. So when some inaccurate predictions arise, it means that the model must be improved or changed, not that the mathematics is wrong. For example, the perihelion precession of Mercury cannot be explained by Newton\u0027s law of gravitation, but is accurately explained by Einstein\u0027s general relativity. This experimental validation of Einstein\u0027s theory shows that Newton\u0027s law of gravitation is only an approximation (which still is very accurate in everyday life).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMathematics is essential in many fields, including natural sciences, engineering, medicine, finance, computer science and social sciences. Some areas of mathematics, such as statistics and game theory, are developed in direct correlation with their applications, and are often grouped under the name of applied mathematics. Other mathematical areas are developed independently from any application (and are therefore called pure mathematics), but practical applications are often discovered later. A fitting example is the problem of integer factorization, which goes back to Euclid, but which had no practical application before its use in the RSA cryptosystem (for the security of computer networks).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"Ingl\u00E9s","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/mathematics-math-class-8-practical-tests-and-answers/","imageUri":"https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4536714_169f.jpg?secure=YQAZ2RtR_yAlDqt_SLZM0A%3D%3D%2C1646618576","duration":"255 questions","enrolledStudentsCount":"2.761 estudiantes","lastUpdated":"Fecha de la \u00FAltima actualizaci\u00F3n: 2/2022","targetAudiences":["Students of 8 class","Teachers","Fathers and mothers / Parents","Kids"],"tags":["Ense\u00F1anzas y disciplinas acad\u00E9micas","Matem\u00E1ticas","Matem\u00E1ticas"],"rating":null,"instructors":[{"name":"SMARTER ACADEMY","url":"/user/haytham-hesham-elsayed-hashem-elmousalami/","totalNumberOfStudents":181506,"totalNumberOfReviews":2223,"averageRating":4.232064823465704}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"0063879D006A09017D53","originalPrice":"\u20B912.800","discountedPrice":"Gratuito","expirationText":"4 dias","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/risk-management-professional-pmi-rmp-questions/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4430524,"title":"TOP Risk Management Professional (PMI-RMP) Questions","shortDescription":"Boost your salary and Career ....

It was introduced by American engineer Bill Smith while working at Motorola in 1986. A six sigma process is one in which 99.99966% of all opportunities to produce some feature of a part are statistically expected to be free of defects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESix Sigma strategies seek to improve manufacturing quality by identifying and removing the causes of defects and minimizing variability in manufacturing and business processes. It does this by using empirical and statistical quality management methods and by hiring people who serve as Six Sigma experts. Each Six Sigma project follows a defined methodology and has specific value targets, such as reducing pollution or increasing customer satisfaction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe term \u003Cem\u003ESix Sigma\u003C/em\u003E originates from statistical modeling of manufacturing processes. The maturity of a manufacturing process can be described by a \u003Cem\u003Esigma\u003C/em\u003E rating indicating its yield or the percentage of defect-free products it creates\u2014specifically, to within how many standard deviations of a normal distribution the fraction of defect-free outcomes corresponds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHistory\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMotorola pioneered Six Sigma, setting a \u0022six sigma\u0022 goal for its manufacturing business. It registered Six Sigma as a service mark on June 11, 1991 U.S. Service Mark 1,647,704; on December 28, 1993, it registered Six Sigma as a trademark. In 2005 Motorola attributed over $17 billion in savings to Six Sigma.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHoneywell and General Electric were also early adopters of Six Sigma. As GE\u0027s CEO, in 1995 Jack Welch made it central to his business strategy, and in 1998 it announced $350 million in cost savings thanks to Six Sigma, which was an important factor in the spread of Six Sigma (this figure later grew to more than $1 billion). By the late 1990s, about two-thirds of the Fortune 500 organizations had begun Six Sigma initiatives with the aim of reducing costs and improving quality.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn recent years, some practitioners have combined Six Sigma ideas with lean manufacturing to create a methodology named Lean Six Sigma. The Lean Six Sigma methodology views lean manufacturing, which addresses process flow and waste issues, and Six Sigma, with its focus on variation and design, as complementary disciplines aimed at promoting \u0022business and operational excellence\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn 2011, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has published the first standard \u0022ISO 13053:2011\u0022 defining a Six Sigma process.

We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E*\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E javascript course contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript introduction\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript array\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript variables\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript functions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript objects\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript control statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript cookies\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript loop statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript data structures\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript error handling\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript regular expressions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESection 4- python programming language.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis course section provides an introduction to programming and the python language. students are introduced to core python programming concepts like conditionals, loops, variables, and functions. this section includes an overview of the various python aspects.
