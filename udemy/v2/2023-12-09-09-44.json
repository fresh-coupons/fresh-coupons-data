Unemployed for two years, no real friends a failing marriage, his family homeless at one point; he didn\u2019t think things could get any worse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, on November 6th 1991, things got MUCH worse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA personal tragedy (every parent\u2019s worst nightmare), showed Andy what it was like to be at the very bottom of life\u2019s barrel. He takes over the story:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u201CWell, over the following few years, I grieved, reflected a lot. I read a lot. I learned a lot\u2026 Even went on a couple of \u2018personal development\u2019 courses. I now completely understand (from a psychological perspective) exactly what I was going through\u2026 but not at the time! Unsurprisingly my marriage finally failed. It dawned on me that I needed to effectively reinvent myself.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EAnd, in doing so, I started experimenting in what I could do to make a difference in my life\u2026 I initially thought it was about money. However I was wrong. After exactly a year of trial and experimentation, I decided to make a specific effort to study and practice just THREE particular areas.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EMore by luck than judgement I believe I got these three things absolutely right.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EIt is those three areas that have made fundamental differences in my life \u2013 such that, these days, I can claim to be a very different person.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EPeople still meet me and call me \u2018Lucky\u2019 for what I have. But I know better. They didn\u2019t see me back in the early \u201890\u2019s!! Yeah\u2026 Luck may play its part \u2013 but I tell you, the Yoo approach, for me, has been the \u2018Luck Generator\u2019. \u003C/em\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EAnd it\u2019s simple to learn!\u201D\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe three areas of study\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAndy\u2019s successful \u2018Personal Development\u2019 approach (which he now calls \u2018Yoo\u2019) boils down to three interrelated areas:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E1. Self awareness to build esteem and confidence\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E2.

Personal resilience to face (or create) important changes in our lives\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Yoo course covers these three areas showing how each is interrelated. You literally can\u2019t address ONE without affecting the other two.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EContents and overview\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter an introduction you get an immediate opportunity to \u2018Self-select\u2019 your personality type based on descriptions on a set of colour cards. You end up with a \u2018Colour Order\u2019 to which you can refer as you learn more about yourself and other people during the course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen it\u2019s time to understand the underpinning psychology starting with Hippocrates \u2013 and some pretty gross-out medicinal practices, through to Carl Jung, one of the \u2018Fathers\u2019 of modern psychology.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe learn that our fundamental, psychological differences are based on just a few preferences and traits. Once we know what these are, we can start to recognise such traits in real life through observing our own and others\u2019 behaviours.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll well and good. However, we need to also understand what happens to our behaviour on a BAD day. The answer will surprise you \u2013 because Bad day behaviour is directly related to Good day behaviour \u2013 and we find out exactly how.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBear in mind that, throughout the course, there are downloadable exercises and information sheets to help you apply your new-found learning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext up is the four \u2018R\u2019s. A simple model to help us understand how a relationship develops\u2026 and why it has to happen in a particular order. Here, we also examine whether you want to kill me or have babies with me! This is because we are still subject to primal human reactions \u2013 even though, these days, political correctness demands we largely keep these things to ourselves!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow is the time to review the colour energies to be able to \u2018read\u2019 others. We look at typical \u003Cstrong\u003EBody language\u003C/strong\u003E, \u003Cstrong\u003ETone\u003C/strong\u003E and likely \u003Cstrong\u003EContent\u003C/strong\u003E of speech. We even have the basic \u2018motto\u2019 for each type. From this it\u2019s a short hop to a fascinating model (Created by the author Gary Chapman) called the 5 Love languages. There\u2019s no better insight into your \u2018significant other\u2019s\u2019 preferences.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEmotional intelligence (or EQ) marks our next stop. The basic components of EQ speak of self-awareness and understanding others, so it\u2019s a no brainer as part of the Yoo course. We also explore \u2018Psychological Payoffs\u2019 which can often be our unconscious barriers to making the changes we want to make in our lives.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBy the end of this course\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPeople will be drawn to you \u2013 and they won\u2019t know really know why\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EYou will have the knack of being able to \u2018read\u2019 someone almost instantaneously\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EYour Communication with others will improve \u2013 misunderstandings drop\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EYou will be far more self-accepting and confident in who you are\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EYou will find it easier to forgive \u2013 or at least understand why people behave in negative ways\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EYou may become more tolerant \u2013 and yet more assertive\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EYou will be able to anticipate how certain people will react to certain situations\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EYou might even find out what people say about you when you\u2019re not there!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that\u2019s just for starters \u2013 it all depends on how you apply your learning \u2013 and in what context.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWho this course is for:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose who work, play, meet and interact with other people on a daily basis (at work you might be in sales, teaching, management, professional services, a therapist, hospitality, customer services or the caring professions.

This Microcontroller is called\u0026nbsp;DigiSpark.\u0026nbsp;It is a microcontroller\u0026nbsp;based on the Attiny85 development board. It is similar to Arduino but smaller and more powerful in terms of\u0026nbsp;hacking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstalling backdoors, exfiltrating documents, or capturing credentials is incredibly easy with a seemingly innocent USB drive called the USB\u0026nbsp; Rubber Ducky. An Expert hacker with a few minutes, photographic memory,\u0026nbsp; and perfect typing accuracy can use a few well-crafted keystrokes to hack virtually anything they have physical access to. However, the proper hardware can do the same thing every time on demand without fail.\u0026nbsp; That\u2019s where the Rubber Ducky and other Human Interface Devices (HID)\u0026nbsp; come into play. They inject keystrokes at superhuman speeds, violating computers\u0027 inherent trust in humans by posing as a keyboard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this class, we\u2019ll learn more about what HID attacks are, how they work,\u0026nbsp; the social engineering that can be involved in their deployment, and how to use them in your Pen-testing engagements. Keyboards announce themselves to computers as HID devices and are in turn automatically recognized and accepted. We\u0027ll program a microcontroller in Arduino to take advantage of this by acting as an HID device. We can then create scripts that run when the device is plugged into a target computer. All at only a fraction of the cost of the more well-branded USB Rubber\u0026nbsp; Ducky!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStudents will learn to use a low-cost Digispark to program their payloads for use in Ethical Hacking and Penetration testing. We\u0027ll go over creating more advanced loads, including tracking payloads that run in the background, as well as Rickroll payloads that can be used with permission from friends and family to demonstrate how HID attacks work. Additionally, students learn to automate nearly anything on an unattended device which can be extremely useful when you need to run the same commands on a series of computers.\u0026nbsp; That\u2019s how the Original USB Ruber Ducky was invented. Hak5 founder\u0026nbsp; Darren Kitchen, while working as a sysadmin, got tired of typing the same commands to fix printers and network shares, again and again, and the device evolved out of laziness. He programmed a development board to emulate the typing for him - and thus the keystroke injection attack was born.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0647\u0644 \u0635\u0646\u0627\u0639\u0647 \u062C\u0647\u0627\u0632 \u0631\u0627\u0628\u0631 \u062F\u0643\u064A\u061F\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u062F\u0639\u0646\u0627 \u0646\u062A\u0639\u0631\u0641 \u0639\u0644\u0649\u0026nbsp;

A successful manager is now expected to act as a leader, a mentor, and a coach, guiding their team members towards individual and collective success.

It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables.

I wanted to learn, not only what a media trainer does, but also what steps I would have to take in order to become a successful media trainer--TJ discusses all this in a clear and concise manner, in a tone that is welcoming and never alienating. The only constructive critique I would give would be concerning the technical form of the presentation, more specifically the video quality and picture aesthetic. Going by the current standard as it applies to video, everything we view is in high definition. Having said that, I believe the video quality could be improved upon as well as the backdrop which I found to be a bit generic and outdated. I found these minor flaws to be slightly distracting and given the high caliber of the speaker and the information being presented I believe these aspects detracted, if only marginally, from the quality of the product.\u0022\u0026nbsp;\u003C/em\u003ENick Cisik\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u00225 Stars!

This is often used for release points (v1.0, v2.0, etc.). Tags are immutable, meaning once they are created for a particular commit, they should not change. This makes them ideal for marking past versions or significant commits, providing a snapshot of a project at a specific point in time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E5.

They allow a program to continue running or gracefully terminate when an error occurs, rather than abruptly stopping. This is crucial in maintaining the control flow and ensuring the robustness of PL/SQL applications. While improving performance, facilitating database interaction, and optimizing SQL queries are important aspects of PL/SQL, they are not the primary purpose of exception handling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EQuestion: In PL/SQL, what is the difference between a function and a procedure?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOptions: \u003Cbr\u003EA. Functions can return multiple values, whereas procedures cannot \u003Cbr\u003EB. Functions must return a value, whereas procedures do not \u003Cbr\u003EC. Procedures are used for calculations, while functions are not \u003Cbr\u003ED. There is no significant difference between the two\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECorrect Answer: B\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExplanation: The key distinction between functions and procedures in PL/SQL lies in their return capabilities. A function is designed to return a single value and is often used for computations that produce a result. In contrast, a procedure does not return a value but can perform a series of operations and can return multiple values through OUT parameters. Understanding this fundamental difference is essential in PL/SQL, as it influences the design of program units and their appropriate application in solving specific problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EQuestion: Which PL/SQL structure is most appropriate for executing a block of code multiple, but a known number of times?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOptions: \u003Cbr\u003EA.

It allows for precise control over the number of iterations, making it highly suitable for scenarios where the number of repetitions is predetermined. The WHILE loop is used when the number of iterations is not known beforehand but is dependent on a condition. The IF-THEN-ELSE and CASE statements are conditional control structures and are not designed for repetitive execution of code blocks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EQuestion: What is the role of cursors in PL/SQL?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOptions: \u003Cbr\u003EA.

They provide a mechanism to iterate over each row in a result set, allowing PL/SQL to handle data one record at a time. This is particularly useful in complex data manipulation and retrieval operations where each row of data may require individual processing. While performance optimization, error handling, and memory management are critical aspects of PL/SQL, they are not the primary functions of cursors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EQuestion: What are PL/SQL collections and why are they used?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOptions: \u003Cbr\u003EA.

Structures for batch processing of SQL statements\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECorrect Answer: A\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExplanation: PL/SQL collections are advanced data structures (like arrays, nested tables, and associative arrays) used for storing and manipulating sets of data. They allow for the temporary storage of data in memory, which can be accessed and manipulated programmatically within PL/SQL blocks. Collections are highly flexible and efficient for handling multiple pieces of data under a single variable, especially when dealing with bulk operations or complex data processing tasks. They are not directly related to database security, external system integration, or batch processing of SQL statements but are integral to sophisticated data handling and manipulation in PL/SQL.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEnroll now and take the first step towards mastering PL/SQL and securing your dream job!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/pl-sql-interview-questions-test/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5700892_6d96.jpg","duration":"423 questions","enrolledStudentsCount":"100.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Aspiring Database Professionals: If you\u0027re starting your journey into the world of database management and programming, this course will provide you with a strong foundation in PL/SQL.

Normalization is a fundamental database design technique that organizes data to minimize redundancy and dependency. It involves dividing a database into two or more tables and defining relationships between the tables. This process enhances the data integrity and reduces redundancy, which means that the same data isn\u2019t duplicated in multiple places. This can lead to more efficient storage, but its primary purpose is not to increase storage efficiency, simplify the structure, or enhance query performance directly, although these can be indirect benefits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EQuestion:\u003C/strong\u003E In MySQL, which command is used to remove duplicate rows from a result set?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA) DISTINCT\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB) UNIQUE\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EC) REMOVE_DUPLICATES\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ED) DELETE_DUPLICATES\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EExplanation:\u003C/strong\u003E The correct answer is A) DISTINCT. The DISTINCT keyword is used in SQL to eliminate duplicate rows from the results of a SELECT query. When you include DISTINCT in your SELECT statement, the database system processes all rows and returns only unique rows for the columns specified. It\u0027s important to note that DISTINCT applies to the entire row, not just one column, and it evaluates all the selected columns in combination to determine uniqueness.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EQuestion:\u003C/strong\u003E What is the significance of the ACID properties in a database system?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA) To ensure database security and integrity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB) To manage database transactions effectively.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EC) To enhance the speed of database operations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ED) To provide a backup and recovery mechanism.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EExplanation:\u003C/strong\u003E The correct answer is B) To manage database transactions effectively. ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. These properties are essential in the context of transaction processing in a database system. Atomicity ensures that all operations within a transaction are completed; if not, the transaction is aborted. Consistency guarantees that a transaction will bring the database from one valid state to another. Isolation means that the concurrent execution of transactions leaves the database in the same state that would have been obtained if the transactions were executed sequentially. Durability ensures that once a transaction has been committed, it will remain so, even in the event of a system failure. These properties collectively ensure reliable, consistent, and safe transaction processing in a database environment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EQuestion:\u003C/strong\u003E Which statement about MySQL indexes is true?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA) Indexes slow down data retrieval but speed up data insertion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB) Indexes are automatically created for primary key columns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EC) Full-text indexes are used for all types of data searches.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ED) Indexes consume no additional storage space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EExplanation:\u003C/strong\u003E The correct answer is B) Indexes are automatically created for primary key columns. In MySQL, when you define a column as a primary key, the system automatically creates an index for this column. This index speeds up queries that search for values in the primary key column. Contrary to option A, indexes are designed to speed up data retrieval, especially for large tables, though they can slow down data insertion and updates due to the need for maintaining the index. Option C is incorrect because full-text indexes are specifically designed for text-based columns and are used to efficiently query text within those columns. As for option D, indexes do consume additional storage space as they essentially create an additional structure to store data for quick access.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EQuestion:\u003C/strong\u003E What is the main advantage of using stored procedures in MySQL?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA) They are more secure than standard SQL queries.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB) They offer better performance by reducing network traffic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EC) They automatically optimize database tables.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ED) They provide a user-friendly interface to interact with the database.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EExplanation:\u003C/strong\u003E The correct answer is B) They offer better performance by reducing network traffic. Stored procedures are beneficial because they allow you to encapsulate and centralize logic on the database server. By doing so, they can reduce the amount of data sent over the network, especially in scenarios where multiple SQL statements need to be executed. This can significantly improve performance, particularly in distributed applications. While stored procedures can enhance security (by restricting direct access to tables and database objects), their primary advantage is not security but performance. They do not automatically optimize database tables, nor are they primarily used to provide a user-friendly interface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEnroll Now!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJoin this course today and take a significant step towards mastering MySQL.

Course for any who want to build a career at business or improve their knowledge.","Mini MBA programs have gained significant popularity in recent years as a valuable educational option for both employers and experts seeking to enhance their careers or start their own businesses. These condensed, focused programs offer a taste of traditional MBA coursework without the time and financial commitments required by full-length MBA programs. Here\u0027s why Mini MBA programs are important for building careers and businesses:","1. Skill Enhancement: Mini MBA programs provide participants with a comprehensive understanding of key business principles, such as finance, marketing, strategy, and leadership. This knowledge equips individuals with the skills necessary to excel in their current roles or transition into new ones. Employers can benefit from employees who possess a broader skill set and can contribute more effectively to the organization\u0027s success.","2. Cost-Effective: Mini MBA programs are typically more affordable than full-length MBA programs, making them accessible to a wider range of professionals. This affordability allows individuals to invest in their education without incurring substantial debt, making it a viable option for those looking to advance their careers or start their own businesses.","3. Time Efficiency: Many professionals cannot commit to the two-year duration of a traditional MBA program due to work and personal commitments. Mini MBA programs are designed to be completed in a shorter time frame, often a few months, making it possible for individuals to balance their education with their existing responsibilities.","4. Networking Opportunities: Mini MBA programs often bring together a diverse group of professionals from various industries and backgrounds. This diversity fosters valuable networking opportunities, enabling participants to connect with peers, instructors, and industry experts. Building a strong professional network can open doors to new career opportunities and potential business collaborations.","5.

And after that, we are going to build our first simple yet very interesting project and that\u0027s a payment page with Paypal. The second project will be about a simple forum system. They are going to be also a couple of generic projects like the full CRUD\u0026nbsp;app and so on. After this, the next project will be the starting of something big because it\u0027s an authentication system where I am going to teach you how to develop a login and a register page, how to hash and de-hash passwords, how to do validation and so much more. After this, we are going to build a comments system and this will be the biggest project in this course. We will begin first by doing a post system and then we will grab comments for every post that we have of course we will use Ajax-JQuery for inserting, deleting, and showing comments. after that, we will integrate a rating system into the previous two projects to make a bigger project. So, I will show how to download a JQuery plugin, how to integrate it and how to use it to do the rating system for every post, and so on. And the rating system is going to be implemented of course using Ajax-JQuery.
