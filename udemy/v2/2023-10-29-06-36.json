It was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994. The PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group. PHP originally stood for \u003Cem\u003EPersonal Home Page\u003C/em\u003E, but it now stands for the recursive initialism \u003Cem\u003EPHP: Hypertext Preprocessor\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPHP code is usually processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module, a daemon, or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. On a web server, the result of the interpreted and executed PHP code \u2013 which may be any type of data, such as generated HTML or binary image data \u2013 would form the whole or part of an HTTP response. Various web template systems, web content management systems, and web frameworks exist which can be employed to orchestrate or facilitate the generation of that response. Additionally, PHP can be used for many programming tasks outside of the web context, such as standalone graphical applications and robotic drone control. Arbitrary PHP code can also be interpreted and executed via a command-line interface (CLI).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe standard PHP interpreter, powered by the Zend Engine, is free software released under the PHP License. PHP has been widely ported and can be deployed on most web servers on almost every operating system and platform, free of charge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe PHP language evolved without a written formal specification or standard until 2014, with the original implementation acting as the \u003Cem\u003Ede facto\u003C/em\u003E standard which other implementations aimed to follow. Since 2014, work has gone on to create a formal PHP specification.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs of January 2021, 72% of PHP websites use discontinued versions of PHP, i.e. PHP 7.2 or lower, which are no longer supported by The PHP Development Team. A large additional fraction uses PHP 7.3, which is only (up to December 6, 2021) \u0022supported for critical security issues only.\u0022 Over 40% of all PHP websites use version 5.6 or older, which not even Debian supports (Debian 9 supported version 7.0 and 7.1).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBeginner Friendliness\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEasy to Get Started With\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPHP was designed to make web development easier, and many beginners find it effortless to pick up and get started with. In fact, PHP code was so easy to pick up, many non-programmers end up being able to hack PHP code together without truly understanding the code.

Learners will come away with an in-depth understanding of the world of forensic accounting and the many ways in which it may differ from the typical accountant\u2019s role. Forensic accounting is the investigation of fraud or financial manipulation by performing extremely detailed research and analysis of financial information. Forensic accountants are often hired to prepare for litigation related to insurance claims, insolvency, divorces, embezzlement, fraud, skimming, and any type of financial theft. Forensic accountants or auditors take a unique focus on performing their work. Typically, when a person with forensic experience is called in to examine financial records, it is due to suspicion of fraud, evaluation of assets, or even to track down fundamentally incorrect accounting.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/forensic-accounting-fraud-detection-and-investigation/","imageUri":"https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5615328_42e9.jpg","duration":"3 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"113.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Students, Professionals, Accountants, Tax professionals, Anyone who wants to understand forensic accounting"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":0,"averageValue":"0.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"EDUCBA Bridging the Gap","url":"/user/premananda-suna/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":0}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"EDUCBA202","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/wcsjwvoc/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":2426532,"title":"The Python and Django Learning Guide","shortDescription":"\u062A\u0639\u0644\u0645 \u0644\u063A\u0629 \u0628\u0627\u064A\u062B\u0648\u0646 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0644\u063A\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064A\u0629 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0641\u0631","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u062F\u0648\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0641\u0635\u0644\u0629 \u0641\u064A \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u062A\u0648\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0648\u0644 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u062B\u0627\u0646\u064A \u0645\u0646 \u0628\u0627\u064A\u062B\u0648\u0646 \u062D\u064A\u062B \u0627\u0641\u062A\u0631\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u062E\u0635 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064A \u0627\u0645\u0627\u0645\u064A \u0644\u0627 \u064A\u0639\u0631\u0641 \u0627\u064A \u0634\u064A \u0639\u0646 \u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0631\u0645\u062C\u0629 \u0633\u062A\u062A\u0645\u0643\u0646 \u0645\u0646 \u062E\u0644\u0627\u0644 \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u062F\u0648\u0631\u0629 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062F\u062E\u0648\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0649 \u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0631\u0645\u062C\u0629 \u0648\u0641\u0647\u0645 \u0627\u0633\u0627\u0633\u064A\u0627\u062A \u0627\u0644\u0644\u063A\u0627\u062A \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0631\u0645\u062C\u064A\u0629 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0644\u0627 \u062A\u062D\u062A\u0627\u062C \u0627\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u064A \u0645\u0624\u0647\u0644\u0627\u062A \u0644\u0644\u062F\u062E\u0648\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0649 \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u062F\u0648\u0631\u0629 \u060C\u062A\u062A\u0645\u064A\u0632 \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u062F\u0648\u0631\u0629 \u0628\u0623\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u0645\u0641\u0635\u0644\u0629 \u0648\u0644\u0643\u0646 \u0644\u064A\u0633 \u0641\u064A\u0647\u0627 \u062A\u0634\u0639\u0628\u0627\u062A \u0648\u062A\u0641\u0627\u0635\u064A\u0644 \u063A\u064A\u0631 \u0627\u0633\u0627\u0633\u064A\u0629\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecome a Python Programmer and learn one of employer\u0027s most requested skills of 2022!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the most yet straightforward course for the Python programming language on Udemy!

To initiate decisions that are translated in to concrete actions can be done only by true leaders who can fore see all kinds of situations. Managers must guide and motivate their people to achieve newer heights and become an asset to the company. A leader must direct, influence and motivate employees to perform essential tasks.

It assumes that you\u0027re new to the language, so it gets you started with basic functionality such as creating functions, creating variables, and calling these lines of code from your standard HTML pages.
