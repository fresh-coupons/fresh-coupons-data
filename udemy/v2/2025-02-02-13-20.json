Solaris supports SPARC and x86-64 workstations and servers from Oracle and other vendors. Solaris was registered as compliant with UNIX 03 until 29 April \u003Cstrong\u003E2019\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHistorically, Solaris was developed as proprietary software. In June 2005, Sun Microsystems released most of the codebase under the CDDL license, and founded the OpenSolaris open-source project. With OpenSolaris, Sun wanted to build a developer and user community around the software. After the acquisition of Sun Microsystems in January 2010, Oracle decided to discontinue the OpenSolaris distribution and the development model. In August 2010, Oracle discontinued providing public updates to the source code of the Solaris kernel, effectively turning Solaris 11 back into a closed source proprietary operating system. Following that, OpenSolaris was forked as illumos and is alive through several illumos distributions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn 2011, the Solaris 11 kernel source code leaked to BitTorrent. Through the Oracle Technology Network (OTN), industry partners can gain access to the in-development Solaris source code.[11] Solaris is developed under a proprietary development model, and only the source for open-source components of Solaris 11 is available for download from Oracle\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-unix-from-zero-to-hero-for-beginner/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/3552815_a273_5.jpg","duration":"9 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"4,211.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Anyone interested to learn Unix Oracle Solaris"],"tags":["Unix"],"rating":{"count":209,"averageValue":"4.2"},"instructors":[{"name":"Tareq Tech","url":"/user/tareq-mohammed-ali/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.26}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"49264E4256C43BB9933A","originalPrice":"\u20B92,799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"3 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/capcut-mastery-create-stunning-social-media-videos/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":6285257,"title":"Capcut Mastery: Create Stunning Social Media Videos","shortDescription":"Learn professional video editing techniques","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EElevate Your Social Media Game with Capcut\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre you ready to take your social media content to the next level?
