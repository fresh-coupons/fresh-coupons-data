Linode is a popular cloud hosting provider that offers a range of services, including virtual private servers (VPS), storage, and networking. Students will learn how to deploy and configure a virtual instance and use it to host a website or application using LAMP Stack. LAMP stands for Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP and is a popular stack used to build dynamic websites and web applications. Students will learn how to install and configure each component of the stack and use it to create a functional website or web application. The course will then cover Linux foundations, where we explore the Linux file system, basic commands, and user accounts.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn the following section students explore server security, including best practices for securing a server and common security threats. Students will learn about firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and how to secure sensitive data. We will demonstrate how to setup custom ports, hardware firewalls, and software firewalls using UFW.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EFinally, the course will cover installing and configuring SSL certificates. SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is a standard security technology for establishing an encrypted link between a web server and a browser.
