I have recently made the transition from being a PhD student in Computer Science to a Senior Data Scientist at a large tech company. In this course I give you all the questions and answers that I used to prepare for my data science interviews as well as the questions and answers that I now expect when I am giving interviews to potential data science candidates. The course provides a complete list of 150\u002B questions and answers that you can expects in a typical data science interview including questions on machine learning, neural networks and deep learning, statistics, practical experience, big data technologies, SQL, computer science, culture fit, questions for the interviewer and brainteasers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat questions will you learn the answer to?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat is the bias-variance tradeoff?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow would you evaluate an algorithm on unbalanced data?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen would you use gradient descent (GD) over stochastic gradient descent (SDG), and vice-versa?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy do segmentation CNNs typically have an encoder-decoder style / structure?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy we generally use Softmax non-linearity function as last operation in-network?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou randomly draw a coin from 100 coins \u2014 1 unfair coin (head-head), 99 fair coins (head-tail) and roll it 10 times.
