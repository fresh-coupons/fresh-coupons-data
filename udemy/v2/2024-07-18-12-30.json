Zero trust architectures simplify network infrastructure, make users happier, and keep cyberthreats at a distance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince John Kindervag, then at Forrester Research, coined the phrase, zero trust architectures follow the maxim \u0022never trust, always verify.\u0022 To block inappropriate access and lateral movement throughout an environment, zero trust architecture enforces access policies based on context\u2014including the user\u0027s role and location, the device they\u0027re using, and the data they\u0027re asking for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA zero trust architecture means you know who\u0027s using what, and you can track it, including encrypted traffic; you need to monitor and verify the traffic between parts of the environment; and you need multifactor authentication (MFA) that goes beyond passwords.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn important thing to remember is that in a zero trust architecture, a resource\u0027s location isn\u0027t as important as before. Rather than rigid network segmentation, software-defined microsegmentation protects your data, workflows, services, and such anywhere, in your data center or distributed hybrid or multicloud.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy using a network-centric data security strategy that provides specific access only to those who need it, Zero Trust Architecture focuses on the business needs and functionality of an organization. By enabling parameters to dictate access and restrictions, the Zero Trust model views data security from a whole new perspective. As opposed to legacy networks that have little to no visibility or control over network and data usage, Zero Trust Architectures see all network traffic through segmentation gateways with granular policies governing access to data, apps, and assets. There are certain rules that have to be followed before a resource can be accessed in a Zero Trust network.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe five major topics I want to cover in this master\u0027s course are\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

I have tried to cover the aspects of ROI Calculations, Net Metering mechanism, import-export billing system, financial models, their comparative, monitoring system of the solar plants and finally cleaning needs of the solar plants.\u0026nbsp; Net Metering, Different types of Installations, Monitoring etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome of these aspects like Net metering, import-export billing and monitoring are generally missed in the other courses. I understand how difficult it is sometimes to explain the technical aspects, therefore I have tried to take the help of analogies and simple to relate examples and calculations for developing an easier understanding of the complex technicalities. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeing working as a Solar Energy consultant and executed approximately 50 projects with an aggregated capacity of 4000 kWp or 4 MWp, I have been able to gain useful experience and insights. I have tried to pour all my experience into this course, hope this would be valuable. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExamples from the industrial experience coupled with tips and thumb rules, average calculation formulae etc would really equip the viewer to gain a great command and grip. After, taking this course, a very detailed understanding of all the fundamentals involving Technicals, financial, execution, would help in building up the required confidence for taking up Solar projects or assignments in this field. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBe ready to cover tons of topics in the Solar field to charge yourself for your Solar expertise. We will be covering topics such as- \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ehow to calculate the Savings and ROI period of your solar plant with easy to understand examples.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHow to choose the best financial model for your solar plant, Comparative of different financial models. \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EUnderstand the net metering and calculate the bills from import and export readings. \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERole of monitoring and cleaning in increasing the output of the Solar Plant. \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis course has been designed for: anyone who wants to explore the ins and outs of Solar PV Energy. The course has been designed in such a way that it is suitable for beginners and some of the detailed calculations and concepts would benefit the advanced learners as well. I am sure, it will also prove awesome for experienced Solar Professionals who want to enhance their skills and increment knowledge as some of the concepts presented here are not shared in other equivalent courses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou would see them once you go through the course.
