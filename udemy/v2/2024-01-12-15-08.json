In many ways, the normally tuned immune system continuously plays an orchestrated \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esymphony to maintain homeostasis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe immune system is a \u201Cteam effort,\u003C/strong\u003E\u201D involving many different players. These players can be divided roughly into two groups: those that are members of the innate immune system team and those that are part of the adaptive immune system. Importantly, these two groups work together to provide a powerful defense against invaders. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImmunology is a difficult subject for several reasons. First, there are lots of details, and sometimes these details get in \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe way of understanding the concepts. To get around this problem, we\u2019re going to concentrate on the big picture. It \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewill be easy for you to find the details somewhere else. Another difficulty in learning immunology is that there \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eis an exception to every rule. Immunologists love these exceptions, because they give clues as to how the immune \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esystem functions. But for now, we\u2019re just going to learn the rules. Oh sure, we\u2019ll come upon exceptions from time \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eto time, but we won\u2019t dwell on them. Our goal is to exam-ine the immune system, stripped to its essence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA third difficulty in studying immunology is that our knowledge of the immune system is still evolving. As \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyou\u2019ll see, there are many unanswered questions, and some of the things that seem true today will be proven \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efalse tomorrow. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe term \u201Cimmunology\u003C/strong\u003E\u201D is derived from Latin word \u201Cimmunis\u201D means exempt, i.e., protection from infectious diseases. Extensive work on bacteriology and pathology made their respective workers to find methods to develop resistance against infectious diseases in the latter half of 19th and beginning of 20th century. Although the history of immunology is about 100 years old, cellular immunology dates back to the 1950s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ewhy is immunology so important?\u003C/strong\u003E The immune system has involvement in almost all fields related to health and disease. Infections continue to confront human health and well-being on a global scale. Inflammation contributes to the \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Elung, heart and joint diseases, and diabetes mellitus; cancers have to evade immune surveillance, and immune dysregulation leads to allergies that are increasingly prevalent across the world. Only improved understanding of the \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emechanisms by which microbes, allergens, and tumor cells cause disease will result in the development of diagnostic, therapeutic, and preventative strategies to combat this threat.However, we are only beginning the voyage of immunology, and there is much we still need to research and understand. The study of basic immunology may provide students with an opportunity to relate the findings of fundamental sciscientific investigations to clinical problems\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ehistory\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBabylonian Epic of Gilgamesh (2000 B. C.) records the presence of pestilence and diseases. The study of Immunology stemmed out from the Thucydides\u2019 description of individuals who recovered from the plague in Athens. Those individuals, who had already contracted the disease, recovered and became \u201Cimmune.\u201D Variolation was practiced for many years in China. The process involved exposing healthy people to the material derived from the lesions caused by the disease by either putting it under the skin or, more often, inserting powdered scabs from smallpox pustules into the nose. However, that occasionally resulted in death because there was no standardization of the inoculum. Variolation, later, became popular \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ein England, mainly due to the efforts of Lady Mary Wortley Montague and the American colonies. In 1796, Jenner inoculated James Phipps with the material obtained from a cowpox lesion, which appeared on the hand of a \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edairymaid, and he inoculated the experimental subject with smallpox about six weeks later, without producing disease [1]. In 1875, Robert Koch was able to show the presence of anthrax causing bacteria in the lymph nodes of a dead rabbit that was earlier inoculated with the blood of a diseased animal [2]. In a serendipitous discovery, Pasteur was able to attenuate the virulent chicken cholera bacillus and coined the term vaccination. Later, he developed first viable vaccine for anthrax and rabies while Robert Koch studied hypersensitivity in tuberculosis. Although many consider Louis Pasteur the \u201Cfather of \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eimmunology,\u201D it is due to his and Koch\u2019s efforts that firmly established the historical germ theory of disease. Then, various scientists contributed to the development of the concept of cellular and humoral immunity. While working on the development of digestive organ in starfish larvae, Metchnikoff became a leading proponent of the \u201CCellularists.\u201D He believed that phagocytes, not antibodies, played the leading role in immunity. Emil von Behring and Kitasato demonstrated the transfer of immunity against Diphtheria by a soluble \u201Canti-toxin\u201D in the blood\u0026nbsp; whereby, Paul Ehrlich predicted the existence of immune bodies (antibodies) and side-chains from which they arise (receptors). Ehrlich suggested that antigens interact with receptors borne by cells, resulting in the secretion of excess receptors (antibodies).the supporters of alternative theory, i.e., \u201CHumoralists,\u201D believed that a soluble substance in the body was responsible for mediating immunity \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E OVERVIEW OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPHYSICAL BARRIERS\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eimmunological mechanisms\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETHE INNATE IMMUNE SYSTEM\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETHE ADAPTIVE IMMUNE SYSTEM\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eorgan of immune system\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecells of immune system\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAntigen\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMacrophage\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhat is immune response ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eimmunoglobulin\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eimmunotolerance\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehistocompatibility\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eimmunotherapy\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecytokines\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecomplement system\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegulation of immune response\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eimmunity to infection\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etransplantation immunology\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eautoimmune diseases\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehypersensitivity \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eimmunization\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etumor immunology\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eimmunodiagnostics\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/immunology-step-by-step/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5080764_72e0_2.jpg","duration":"6 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"6,718.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Students who are considering or attending medical school or other health-related professional programs (nursing, pharmacy, PA) \u2013 including those at the high school, undergraduate, and postgraduate levels Professionals looking to improve knowledge for work on health care applications, projects, and research Curious learners with sufficient prerequisites (biology, chemistry, physics) who want to know more"],"tags":["Immunology"],"rating":{"count":33,"averageValue":"3.7"},"instructors":[{"name":"Mohamed AL ashram","url":"/user/mohamed-taha-288/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.25}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"47AA948677B096CACFE2","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/plywood-glass-building-hardware-sanitaryware-businesses/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5721400,"title":"Plywood, Glass, Building Hardware \u0026 Sanitaryware Businesses","shortDescription":"Plywood, Glass, Building Hardware, Sanitaryware Businesses, Construction management, Entrepreneurship, Business","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EMaster Course in Plywood, Glass, Building Hardware \u0026amp; Sanitaryware Businesses\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECrafting Modern Spaces: Exploring the World of Plywood, Glass, Building Hardware \u0026amp; Sanitaryware Businesses\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the realm of architecture and interior design, the choice of materials plays a pivotal role in shaping the aesthetics, functionality, and overall ambiance of a space.

Networking and Collaboration: Building knowledge in these areas allows managers to connect with other professionals in the field. Networking and collaboration are crucial for sharing insights, best practices, and staying abreast of industry developments.","In summary, digital transformation and technology management are pivotal for companies and managers in today\u0027s business landscape.

These condensed, focused programs offer a taste of traditional MBA coursework without the time and financial commitments required by full-length MBA programs. Here\u0027s why Mini MBA programs are important for building careers and businesses:  1. Skill Enhancement: Mini MBA programs provide participants with a comprehensive understanding of key business principles, such as finance, marketing, strategy, and leadership. This knowledge equips individuals with the skills necessary to excel in their current roles or transition into new ones. Employers can benefit from employees who possess a broader skill set and can contribute more effectively to the organization\u0027s success.  2. Cost-Effective: Mini MBA programs are typically more affordable than full-length MBA programs, making them accessible to a wider range of professionals. This affordability allows individuals to invest in their education without incurring substantial debt, making it a viable option for those looking to advance their careers or start their own businesses.  3. Time Efficiency: Many professionals cannot commit to the two-year duration of a traditional MBA program due to work and personal commitments. Mini MBA programs are designed to be completed in a shorter time frame, often a few months, making it possible for individuals to balance their education with their existing responsibilities.","4. Networking Opportunities: Mini MBA programs often bring together a diverse group of professionals from various industries and backgrounds. This diversity fosters valuable networking opportunities, enabling participants to connect with peers, instructors, and industry experts. Building a strong professional network can open doors to new career opportunities and potential business collaborations.  5. Entrepreneurial Skill Development: Mini MBA programs are particularly beneficial for aspiring entrepreneurs. They offer insights into business planning, finance, marketing, and strategy \u2013 all critical aspects of launching and running a successful business. Entrepreneurs can use the knowledge gained from a Mini MBA program to make informed decisions and navigate the complexities of entrepreneurship.  6. Adaptability and Continuous Learning: In today\u0027s rapidly changing business landscape, adaptability and continuous learning are essential. Mini MBA programs provide participants with up-to-date knowledge and skills that can help them stay relevant and competitive in their careers. Employers value employees who are committed to ongoing learning and development.  7. Career Advancement: For employees looking to advance within their organizations, a Mini MBA can be a valuable asset. It demonstrates a commitment to professional growth and can make individuals more competitive for promotions and leadership positions.  8. Confidence Building: Mini MBA programs can boost the confidence of both employees and aspiring entrepreneurs. Knowing that you have a solid foundation in business concepts and strategies can empower you to take on new challenges and seize opportunities.","Mini MBA programs offer a cost-effective, time-efficient, and comprehensive way for both employers and experts to enhance their skills, advance their careers, and build successful businesses. Whether you are seeking career growth within an organization or aiming to launch your own venture, a Mini MBA program can provide the knowledge and confidence needed to achieve your goals in the dynamic world of business."],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":0,"averageValue":"0.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"MTF Institute of Management, Technology and Finance","url":"/user/mtfinstitute/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":0}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"11E71BE1A7D19732C312","originalPrice":"\u20B91,999","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"3 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/workshop-methoden-online-und-offline-seminare-leiten/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4696728,"title":"Workshops und Seminare professionell vorbereiten und leiten","shortDescription":"Lerne, wie du erfolgreiche Offline und Online Workshops und Seminare durchf\u00FChren kannst mit erprobten Workshop Methoden","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDieser Kurs hilft dir bei der Vorbereitung, Leitung und Durchf\u00FChrung eines professionellen Workshops.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFreue dich auf gl\u00FCckliche und zufriedene Teilnehmer, ebenso wie gut zahlende Kunden! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEs ist kein Geheimnis, dass Workshops eine gro\u00DFartige M\u00F6glichkeit sind, Menschen zusammenzubringen, um Wissen und Erfahrung auszutauschen\u003C/strong\u003E. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAber was ist, wenn du nicht weisst, wie du sie organisieren sollst?

Once stimulated by a vaccine, the antibody-producing cells, called B cells (or B lymphocytes), remain sensitized and ready to respond to the agent should it ever gain entry to the body. A vaccine may also confer passive immunity by providing antibodies or lymphocytes already made by an animal or human donor. Vaccines are usually administered by injection (parenteral administration), but some are given orally or even nasally (in the case of flu vaccine). Vaccines applied to mucosal surfaces, such as those lining the gut or nasal passages, seem to stimulate a greater antibody response and may be the most effective route of administration.

Prior to that use, however, the principle of vaccination was applied by Asian physicians who gave children dried crusts from the lesions of people suffering from smallpox to protect against the disease. While some developed immunity, others developed the disease. Jenner\u2019s contribution was to use a substance similar to, but safer than, smallpox to confer immunity. He thus exploited the relatively rare situation in which immunity to one virus confers protection against another viral disease. In 1881 French microbiologist Louis Pasteur demonstrated immunization against anthrax by injecting sheep with a preparation containing attenuated forms of the bacillus that causes the disease. Four years later he developed a protective suspension against rabies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVaccine effectiveness\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehistorical mass vaccination programs in the United States\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter Pasteur\u2019s time, a widespread and intensive search for new vaccines was conducted, and vaccines against both bacteria and viruses were produced, as well as vaccines against venoms and other toxins. Through vaccination, smallpox was eradicated worldwide by 1980, and polio cases declined by 99 percent. Other examples of diseases for which vaccines have been developed include mumps, measles, typhoid fever, cholera, plague, tuberculosis, tularemia, pneumococcal infection, tetanus, influenza, yellow fever, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, some types of encephalitis, and typhus\u2014although some of those vaccines are less than 100 percent effective or are used only in populations at high risk. Vaccines against viruses provide especially important immune protection, since, unlike bacterial infections, viral infections do not respond to antibiotics\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVaccine types\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow the polio vaccine changed the world\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe challenge in vaccine development consists in devising a vaccine strong enough to ward off infection without making the individual seriously ill. To that end, researchers have devised different types of vaccines. Weakened, or attenuated, vaccines consist of microorganisms that have lost the ability to cause serious illness but retain the ability to stimulate immunity. They may produce a mild or subclinical form of the disease. Attenuated vaccines include those for measles, mumps, polio (the Sabin vaccine), rubella, and tuberculosis. Inactivated vaccines are those that contain organisms that have been killed or inactivated with heat or chemicals. Inactivated vaccines elicit an immune response, but the response often is less complete than with attenuated vaccines. Because inactivated vaccines are not as effective at fighting infection as those made from attenuated microorganisms, greater quantities of inactivated vaccines are administered. Vaccines against rabies, polio (the Salk vaccine), some forms of influenza, and cholera are made from inactivated microorganisms. Another type of vaccine is a subunit vaccine, which is made from proteins found on the surface of infectious agents. Vaccines for influenza and hepatitis B are of that type. When toxins, the metabolic by-products of infectious organisms, are inactivated to form toxoids, they can be used to stimulate immunity against tetanus, diphtheria, and whooping cough (pertussis).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how vaccines enhance the human immune system to fight against harmful pathogens\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ehistory\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ein the late 20th century, advances in laboratory techniques allowed approaches to vaccine development to be refined. Medical researchers could identify the genes of a pathogen (disease-causing microorganism) that encode the protein or proteins that stimulate the immune response to that organism. That allowed the immunity-stimulating proteins (called antigens) to be mass-produced and used in vaccines. It also made it possible to alter pathogens genetically and produce weakened strains of viruses. In that way, harmful proteins from pathogens can be deleted or modified, thus providing a safer and more-effective method by which to manufacture attenuated vaccines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVaccinology is \u003Cstrong\u003Ethe science and engineering of developing vaccines to prevent infectious diseases\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EVaccines contain antigens that stimulate the immune system to produce an immune response that is often similar to that produced by the natural infection\u003C/strong\u003E.

Genetic material that codes for a desired antigen is inserted into the attenuated form of a large virus, such as the vaccinia virus, which carries the foreign genes \u201Cpiggyback.\u201D The altered virus is injected into an individual to stimulate antibody production to the foreign proteins and thus confer immunity. The approach potentially enables the vaccinia virus to function as a live vaccine against several diseases, once it has received genes derived from the relevant disease-causing microorganisms. A similar procedure can be followed using a modified bacterium, such as \u003Cem\u003ESalmonella typhimurium\u003C/em\u003E, as the carrier of a foreign gene.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGardasil human papillomavirus vaccine\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVaccines against human papillomavirus (HPV) are made from virus like particles (VLPs), which are prepared via recombinant technology.

In addition, their production can be standardized, enabling rapid scale-up for the manufacture of large quantities of vaccine. Novel mRNA vaccines are safe and effective; they do not contain live virus, nor does the RNA interact with human DNA.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eadvantage and dis advantage\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBenefits of vaccination\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFind out from Dr. Tina Tan of Northwestern University why adult vaccination against various types of diseases is important\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee all videos for this article\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to the development of memory B cells, which are capable of triggering a secondary immune response upon exposure to the pathogen targeted by a vaccine, vaccination is also beneficial at the population level. When a sufficient number of individuals in a population are immune to a disease, as would occur if a large proportion of a population were vaccinated, herd immunity is achieved. That means that if there is random mixing of individuals within the population, then the pathogen cannot be spread throughout the population. Herd immunity acts by breaking the transmission of infection or by lessening the chances of susceptible individuals coming in contact with a person who is infectious. Herd immunity provides a measure of protection to individuals who are not personally immune to the disease\u2014for instance, individuals who, because of their age or underlying medical conditions, cannot receive vaccines or individuals who received vaccines but remain susceptible. Herd immunity played an important role in the successful eradication of smallpox, and it is vital in preventing the spread of diseases such as polio and measles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdverse reactions\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVaccination carries some risk of reaction, though adverse effects typically are very rare and very mild. The most common reactions to vaccines include redness and soreness around the vaccination site. More severe adverse reactions, such as vomiting, high fever, seizure, brain damage, or death, are possible for some vaccines. Such reactions are exceptionally rare, however\u2014occurring in less than one in a million people for most vaccines. Severe reactions also tend to affect only certain populations, such as persons whose immune systems are compromised by preexisting disease (e.g., HIV/AIDS) or who are undergoing chemotherapy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClaims have been made that vaccines are responsible for certain adverse health conditions, particularly autism, speech disorders, and inflammatory bowel disease. Some of those claims focused on thimerosal, a mercury-containing compound used as a preservative in vaccines. Some people believed that autism was a form of mercury poisoning, caused specifically by thimerosal in childhood vaccines. Those claims have been discredited. Still, misinformation and fear generated by false claims about associations between autism and vaccines had a significant impact on individuals\u2019 perceptions about vaccine safety. In addition, most individuals in countries where vaccination is widespread have never personally experienced vaccine-preventable disease. Thus, the focus of concern for some people shifted from the negative effects of vaccine-preventable disease to the possible negative effects of the vaccines themselves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComplacency about vaccine-preventable diseases, combined with concerns over the effects of vaccination, led to decreasing levels of vaccination coverage in some areas of the world. As a consequence, not only were individuals susceptible to vaccine-preventable diseases, but, at population levels, vaccination rates dropped low enough to cause losses of herd immunity, thereby allowing outbreaks of disease. Such outbreaks brought high costs to societies, especially in terms of health and medical care, disability and economic strain, and loss of life. In the 20th century in Japan, England, and Russia, for example, numbers of children vaccinated against whooping cough dropped sufficiently low so as to enable outbreaks of disease that involved thousands of children and resulted in hundreds of deaths\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/all-about-vaccine-and-vaccnation/","imageUri":"https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5182800_89bd.jpg","duration":"1.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"2,123.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Medical students and  all professionals concern with vaccination"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":4,"averageValue":"3.7"},"instructors":[{"name":"Mohamed AL ashram","url":"/user/mohamed-taha-288/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":3.875}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"280CE2057BBED2127107","originalPrice":"\u20B91,999","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/genetic-from-mendal-to-era-of-microchip-molecular-genetic/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5365326,"title":"Biotechnology today and yesterday","shortDescription":"Biotechnology applications","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMolecular genetics\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMolecular genetics is a subfield of genetics that focuses on the structure and function of genes on a molecular level, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eincluding genetic variation, gene expression, and DNA replication and repair.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis field aims to understand how genes are transmitted from one generation to the next and how they \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Einfluence human behavior, health, and disease.

DNA template is denatured to single strands.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. DNA primer (with 3\u2019 end near sequence of interest) is annealed to \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe template DNA and extended with DNA polymerase.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Four reactions are set up, each containing:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. DNA template\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Primer annealed to template DNA\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.

Next, a different radio-labeled dideoxynucleotide (ddATP, ddTTP, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EddCTP, or ddGTP) is added to each of the four reaction tubes at \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1/100th the concentration of normal dNTPs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. ddNTPs possess a 3\u2019-H instead of 3\u2019-OH, compete in the reaction with \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enormal dNTPS, and produce no phosphodiester bond.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Whenever the radio-labeled ddNTPs are incorporated in the chain, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDNA synthesis terminates.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Each of the four reaction mixtures produces a population of DNA \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emolecules with DNA chains terminating at all possible positions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. Extension products in each of the four reaction mixutes\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ealso end with a different radio-labeled ddNTP\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(depending on the base).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9. Next, each reaction mixture is electrophoresed in a \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eseparate lane (4 lanes) at high voltage on a \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Epolyacrylamide gel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10.Pattern of bands in each of the four lanes is visualized \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eon X-ray film.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E11.Location of \u201Cbands\u201D in each of the four lanes indicate \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe size of the fragment terminating with a respective \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eradio-labeled ddNTP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E12.DNA sequence is deduced from the pattern of bands in \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe 4 lanes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAutomated Dye-Terminator DNA Sequencing:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

Automated DNA sequencing employs the same general \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eprocedure, but uses ddNTPs labeled with fluorescent dyes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Combine 4 dyes in one reaction tube and electrophores in \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eone lane on a polyacrylamide gel or capillary containing \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Epolyacrylamide.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. UV laser detects dyes and reads the sequence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5.
