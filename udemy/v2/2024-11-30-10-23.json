A course for anyone who wants to build career in management","What are Mergers and Acquisitions (M\u0026A)?  Merger: Two companies of relatively similar size combine forces to create a new, single entity. This is often a move for market expansion or gaining a competitive edge.  Acquisition: One company purchases a majority stake or all of another company. The acquiring company gains control of the acquired company\u0027s assets and operations. This can be done to enter new markets, eliminate competition, or gain new technology resources.","Key Pitfalls in M\u0026A  Culture Clash: Combining distinct company cultures can lead to employee conflicts, low morale, and a decline in productivity.  Overpaying: Enthusiasm can lead companies to overpay for an acquisition, resulting in financial losses down the line.  Poor Integration: Failure to smoothly integrate systems, processes, and teams creates operational chaos and hinders the potential of the combined entity.  Lack of Due Diligence: Insufficient research about the target company\u0027s financial health, legal standing, or market position might expose hidden liabilities and risks.  Loss of Focus: The complexity of the M\u0026A process can distract from core business operations, leading to neglected customers or missed opportunities.","Why is Learning About M\u0026A Important for Companies and Managers?  Strategic Growth: M\u0026A can be a powerful tool to expand into new markets, acquire new technologies, eliminate competitors, or increase market share significantly.  Responding to Market Changes Companies must adapt to industry shifts. An M\u0026A strategy can be vital for staying ahead of the competition or even surviving.  Leadership Development: M\u0026A success relies heavily on the ability of managers to navigate complexity, integrate teams, and make crucial decisions under pressure.","How Can M\u0026A Skills Support Career Development?  Increased Demand: As M\u0026A activity continues to be prevalent, professionals with these skills are highly sought after by companies, investment banks, and consulting firms.  Leadership Opportunities: M\u0026A skills signal strategic thinking, problem-solving abilities, and a talent for execution \u2013 all assets for leadership roles.  Broader Skillset: M\u0026A involves exposure to various aspects of business such as finance, valuation, negotiation, and legal, thus developing a more versatile skillset.  Higher Compensation: M\u0026A professionals often command higher salaries due to their specialized knowledge and in-demand skillsets."],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":58,"averageValue":"4.4"},"instructors":[{"name":"MTF Institute of Management, Technology and Finance","url":"/user/mtfinstitute/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.4583335}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"1142679D7F5CA4DF6D19","originalPrice":"\u20B91,499","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"3 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/mastering-html5-and-css3-part-3-advanced-level/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5968850,"title":"Mastering HTML5 and CSS3 (Part 3 - Advanced Level)","shortDescription":"Level up your skills in HTML and CSS , learn how to create responsive web templates","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the \u0022Mastering HTML5 and CSS3 (Part 3 - Advanced Level)\u0022 course\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you want to know more about \u003Cstrong\u003EHTML \u003C/strong\u003E\u0026amp; \u003Cstrong\u003ECSS\u003C/strong\u003E?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...

Then we will show you how to push local repository to remote repository and pull the remote repository to our local machine. Then we will show you how to work with one of the greatest features of Git, which is branching. We will learn about how to deal with branches locally and also, remotely. We will show you how to merge branches with different methods, and also, how to deal with merge conflicts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen we will see about forking and contributing. We will learn about how to copy someone else\u0027s remote repository on your GitHub account, how to clone it to your local computer and how to contribute to the original project. Finally, we will discuss about collaborating on GitHub. We will go through some really important topics, such as, how to set up a collaboration team, how to define different rules for collaborators and much more. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe encourage you to feel free to ask the questions if you get stuck at any point of time line related to our course and the commands we have used in our course.

Managers can offer insights into effective communication, conflict resolution, and building positive relationships, which can significantly impact an employee\u0027s overall quality of life.  In times of personal crisis or uncertainty, such as major life transitions or unexpected challenges, employees may turn to their managers for guidance. Managers trained in coaching can provide a supportive and non-judgmental space for employees to explore their feelings, identify potential solutions, and develop action plans to address these challenges.","Coaching techniques have become indispensable in the modern workplace, particularly within the roles of managers and leaders. These skills not only drive career development and internal education but also play a crucial role in supporting the mental health and well-being of employees.  As we navigate an ever-changing professional landscape, organizations that recognize the importance of coaching will not only foster a culture of continuous improvement but also cultivate a loyal and motivated workforce. Managers who embrace coaching as a core aspect of their leadership style will not only elevate their own careers but also become catalysts for the success of their teams and organizations as a whole.  By understanding and implementing coaching techniques effectively, managers can truly transform the workplace into an environment where individuals thrive, careers flourish, and holistic well-being is nurtured."],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":60,"averageValue":"4.1"},"instructors":[{"name":"MTF Institute of Management, Technology and Finance","url":"/user/mtfinstitute/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.4423075}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"FA13392A3034F95C7181","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"3 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/professional-certificate-in-career-coaching/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5952512,"title":"Professional Certificate in Career Coaching","shortDescription":"Professional Certificate in Career Coaching by MTF Institute","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWelcome to course: Professional Certificate in Career Coaching by MTF Institute\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECourse provided by \u003Cstrong\u003EMTF Institute of Management, Technology and Finance\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMTF\u003C/strong\u003E is the global educational and research institute with HQ at Lisbon, Portugal, focused on business \u0026amp; professional hybrid (on-campus and online) education at areas: Business \u0026amp; Administration, Science \u0026amp; Technology, Banking \u0026amp; Finance. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMTF R\u0026amp;D \u003C/strong\u003Ecenter focused on research activities at areas: Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Data Science, Big Data, WEB3, Blockchain, Cryptocurrency \u0026amp; Digital Assets, Metaverses, Digital Transformation, Fintech, Electronic Commerce, Internet of Things. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMTF\u003C/strong\u003E is the official partner of: IBM, Intel, Microsoft, member of the Portuguese Chamber of Commerce and Industry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMTF \u003C/strong\u003Eis present in 208 countries and has been chosen by more than 400 000 students.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat is Career Coaching?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECareer coaching is a collaborative process between a coach and a client (the coachee).
