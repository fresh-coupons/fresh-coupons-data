Are you stuck in tutorial hell? want to build your own CV but don\u0027t know how and when to start? If so, this is the right project for you. This course contains five projects for a reason. It covers the most common parts of every web project out there. Even if you are experienced as a developer, you should still give it a shot. and the projects are not similar and that\u0027s the surprise. Every project covers a certain topic.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EFirst of all, we are going to start with probably what every web project has which is the authentication system. It contains a couple of useful parts like validation, password hashing, sessions, and so on. And for the second project, we are going to take a look at the crud app which will help you manipulate data like a pro, set forms, update, delete and create data. The third project is all about building a URL shortening service and that\u0027s pretty simple and yet very practical. We are going to use a bit of Jquery on the way. For the fourth project, which is the largest one of them all, where we are going to integrate our code from the past project (auth system) and we are going to insert images and display them nicely. And that only leaves us with only one project, and that is the email sender that\u0027s one of the most important parts of any kind of development because it will teach you to send emails dynamically.

We will first go through Neural Networks Basics:\u0026nbsp;what are Neural networks , what is the theory behind neural networks , then we will talk about binary classifiers like an SVM for classifying the MNIST\u0026nbsp;datasets, Students will learn how to classify the hand written digits of the MNIST\u0026nbsp;dataset into multiple classes. We will discuss the different types of edge detectors to detect edges in images. After this we will discuss convolutionnal neural networks: how are they built, what are the most common and efficient CNN\u0026nbsp;architectures and how do you implement them in Python. The topic of Object detection and Exhaustive search will also be dealt with. The last part of the class will be an example application of building and training a custom built Convolutionnal neural Network on the cloud to classify images from an open source dataset. All the steps from getting data, reading the data , building the network and training the network on the cloud will be carefully explained so that the student has a working example to be able to reuse for its own purpose. \u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/computer-vision-with-python3/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4662204_ca2f.jpg","duration":"1 total hour","enrolledStudentsCount":"1,284.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Computer Science Students","Computer Vision scientists"],"tags":["Python","Computer Vision"],"rating":{"count":10,"averageValue":"4.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"Lucas Mayrhofer","url":"/user/lucas-mayrhofer/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.3}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"38F91170885F791BA85F","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/siteground-migrator-migra-tu-web-con-wordpress-a-siteground/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5913794,"title":"SiteGround Migrator: Migra tu Web con WordPress a SiteGround","shortDescription":"Migra tu sitio web en WordPress hacia SiteGround, sin saber de programaci\u00F3n, de forma f\u00E1cil y simple.","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u00BFDESEAS APRENDER A MIGRAR UN SITIO WEB CON WORDPRESS HACIA UN HOSTING DE SITEGROUND?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESiteGround Migrator es un plugin gratuito de WordPress desarrollado por SiteGround que nos ayuda a\u003Cstrong\u003E\u0026nbsp;migrar un sitio web con WordPress a tu cuenta en SiteGround desde cualquier otra compa\u00F1\u00EDa de alojamiento web.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPara migrar un sitio web en WordPress con el plugin SiteGround Migrator, b\u00E1sicamente hay que realizar los siguientes pasos:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGenerar un token de migraci\u00F3n en el Site Tools de SiteGround.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstalar el plugin SiteGround Migrator en tu WordPress.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPegar el token de migraci\u00F3n en el plugin para comenzar la migraci\u00F3n.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComprobar tu sitio y actualizar los registros DNS para terminar la migraci\u00F3n.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u00BFQU\u00C9 APRENDER\u00C1S EN NUESTRO CURSO?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EC\u00F3mo obtener un dominio y hosting en SiteGround.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EC\u00F3mo a\u00F1adir un nuevo sitio web a tu plan de hosting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EC\u00F3mo instalar correctamente el plugin SiteGround Migrator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EC\u00F3mo realizar la migraci\u00F3n de tu sitio web con WordPress a SiteGround.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EC\u00F3mo instalar un certificado SSL para tu sitio web migrado.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EC\u00F3mo migrar correctamente un sitio web con WordPress a SiteGround.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u00BFPOR QU\u00C9 ACCEDER A NUESTRO CURSO?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ENuestro curso de \u003Cstrong\u003E\u0022SiteGround Migrator: Migra tu Web con WordPress a SiteGround\u0022\u003C/strong\u003E, es impartido por el experto y consultor de marketing digital: \u0022\u003Cstrong\u003ERenato Yacolca\u003C/strong\u003E\u0022,\u0026nbsp; creador de uno de los canales de YouTube m\u00E1s populares del mundo en los temas de tutoriales y marketing digital: \u003Cstrong\u003EProgramaci\u00F3n F\u00E1cil, SEO y Marketing\u003C/strong\u003E, con m\u00E1s de \u003Cstrong\u003E180,000 estudiantes (Bot\u00F3n de Plata de YouTube)\u003C/strong\u003E, en el que le mostrar\u00E1 c\u00F3mo migrar un sitio web de WordPress con el plugin \u003Cstrong\u003ESiteGround Migrator \u003C/strong\u003Ede forma r\u00E1pida y sencilla. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u00A1ACCEDE AHORA AL CURSO!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EInscr\u00EDbase ahora\u003C/strong\u003E y empiece con su aprendizaje en nuestro curso.
