It assumes that you\u0027re new to the language, so it gets you started with basic functionality such as creating functions, creating variables, and calling these lines of code from your standard HTML pages. It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E*\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E javascript course contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript introduction\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript array\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript variables\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript functions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript objects\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript control statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript cookies\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript loop statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript data structures\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript error handling\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript regular expressions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003Esection 3- learn PHP\u0026nbsp;programming language\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this section, we will learn the basic structure of a web application, and how a web browser interacts with a web server.

Performance goals are specific targets or objectives that individuals or teams are expected to achieve within a given timeframe. These goals play a fundamental role in driving employee performance, aligning organizational objectives, and fostering continuous improvement. We will explore the significance of performance goals in the realm of human resources and the benefits they bring to both employees and organizations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Clarity and Focus: Performance goals provide clarity and direction to employees. When employees have clear goals, they know what is expected of them and can focus their efforts on achieving those objectives. Setting specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals helps employees understand the desired outcomes and enables them to prioritize their tasks effectively.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Motivation and Engagement: Well-defined performance goals have a motivational effect on employees. When employees have challenging yet attainable goals, they are more likely to feel engaged and motivated to perform at their best. Goals create a sense of purpose and provide a framework for employees to channel their energy and expertise towards achieving desired outcomes. They can enhance job satisfaction and increase employee commitment to the organization.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Performance Evaluation: Performance goals serve as a basis for assessing employee performance. By setting clear objectives, managers can evaluate and measure the progress and achievements of employees. Regular performance evaluations help identify areas of improvement, provide constructive feedback, and recognize top performers. Objective evaluation criteria linked to performance goals ensure fairness and transparency in the assessment process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Skill Development: Performance goals create opportunities for employees to develop and enhance their skills and competencies. By setting goals that require employees to stretch beyond their current capabilities, organizations can foster a culture of continuous learning and development. Employees are motivated to acquire new knowledge, acquire relevant training, and seek growth opportunities to meet or exceed their goals. This, in turn, benefits both the individual and the organization by building a skilled and capable workforce.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Alignment with Organizational Objectives: Performance goals play a crucial role in aligning individual and team efforts with the broader organizational objectives. When goals are set in line with the strategic priorities of the organization, employees understand how their work contributes to the overall success of the company. This alignment promotes a sense of organizational unity and helps employees see the bigger picture, fostering a collective effort towards achieving organizational goals. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Accountability and Performance Improvement: Performance goals create a sense of accountability among employees. When employees have clear goals and know they will be evaluated based on their performance, they are more likely to take ownership of their work and strive for excellence. Goals also provide a basis for identifying performance gaps and areas that require improvement. Managers can offer support, guidance, and resources to help employees overcome challenges and enhance their performance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerformance goals are a vital component of effective human resource management. They provide clarity, motivation, and focus for employees, facilitate performance evaluation and skill development, align individual efforts with organizational objectives and foster a culture of accountability and continuous improvement.
