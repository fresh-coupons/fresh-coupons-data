Indeed, you will at first learn all the basics of mathematics especially linear algebra. Once again, you will not become a specialist in this field but you will at least understand the basic concepts of it that can be useful for your understanding of quantum computing. Then, you will learn what exactly is an algorithm and what is the difference between a quantum algorithm and a classical mathematical algorithm. Also, we are going to cover different quantum algorithms that are also really popular in this field. Finally, you will have an introduction to Microsoft Q. In my opinion this is pretty important to learn because this is the programming language that is used to perform different quantum calculations as well as testing or running different quantum apps. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, it\u0027s really important to understand that I created this course on the Principe of learning by practice. This is why even if this course is mostly theoretical, I\u0026nbsp;tried to implement as much practice as possible. This way, when you will have completed this course you will not only be able to understand the basics of what is quantum computing but you will also be able to write basic lines of code and have a basic understanding of different quantum algorithms.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFor who is this course designed\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis course is created for beginners who have no prior knowledge of what is quantum computing and are interested by the topic.

You will be introduced to different quantum algorithms as well as different mathematical notions that will allow to understand a bit more about this topic. So, if you are a student that wishes to learn more about this topic for educational or professional purposes you will definitely enjoy this course. Also, if you are just someone that find this topic interesting and you want to have a basic introduction to it well this course has everything you need.

Where Ethics focuses on moral value of an individual\u2019s actions, Social and Political Philosophy is interested in values related to groups of individuals,\u2014 a community, society, or nation. This branch of philosophy asks questions such as: \u201CWhat makes a good society?\u201D and \u201CWhat makes a government legitimate?\u201D The theories of social and political philosophers provide understanding and justification for considerations such as: the relationship between an individual and the government; the just distribution of resources among individuals; the merit of various forms of political structure and government. Issues such as fairness, justice, human rights, and the responsibilities of government arise in the theories advocated by social and political philosophers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuccessful completion of our study of this unit will enable you to:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERecognize the impact of the philosopher\u2019s view of human nature on proposals made about social order.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnderstand and explain the concept of \u201Csocial contract theory\u201D from diverging points of view, including those of Thomas Hobbes and John Rawls.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExplain and contrast the values underlying Liberalism and Socialism.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDescribe the impact of theories put forth by John Locke and John Stuart Mill on present-day democracy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn our investigation and readings for Social and Political Philosophy, we will encounter the work of these philosophers.

We\u2019ve only recently started creating devices which benefit from such a language, so in the mid-1990s, they were way ahead of their time. But that goal drove a lot of the architecture of Java.

The diversity of the various methods and disciplines on which we draw and the range of the social and intellectual purposes we serve are too great to permit an orthodoxy to develop. Yet, as a result of our discussions and publications during these past two decades, it has become clear that there is a distinctive activity - what we have come to call practical ethics - that merits serious curricular and scholarly attention in the modern university, alongside the traditional disciplines in arts and sciences and in the professional schools. Three characteristics of practical ethics are significant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, practical ethics is a linking discipline, seeking to bridge theory and practice. But it differs from both applied ethics and professional ethics as they are usually understood. We remain as convinced as when we began that moral and political philosophy are essential disciplines for our work. At the same time, we now see more clearly that philosophical principles cannot be applied in any straightforward way to particular problems and policies. In the face of concrete dilemmas, we need to revise philosophical principles as much as we rely on them for justification. One reason is that principles often conflict: how, for example, should an attorney reconcile her commitment to a guilty client (a principle of loyalty) with her commitment to the truth (a principle of veracity)? Understanding such conflicts calls for critical analysis and elaboration of the principles, a process that is distinct from both deductive application and case-by-case intuition. We have also learned that moral reasoning as conventionally understood is not the only important element in deliberation about practical moral questions. Equally significant are moral perception - the ability to recognize an ethical issue in a complex set of circumstances - and moral character - the disposition to live ethically in a coherent way over time. A business executive, for example, may be disposed to act morally in his personal life, but may not see that moral issues are raised in his professional life when he decides to close a plant, or to accept the health risks of workplace hazards. To better understand these dimensions of moral life, practical ethics must draw on other disciplines and other forms of knowledge in addition to philosophy. Understanding ethical decisions in such professions as business, government, law, and medicine obviously requires knowledge of those professions, but beyond that it needs the assistance of moral psychology, sociology, economics and political science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe have also become more critical of professional ethics as it has been taught in many professional schools. Practical ethics in the professions should consist of more than a study of the codes of ethics, such as the legal profession\u0027s code and model rules, or the emulation of role models, as in clinical rounds in teaching hospitals. These may be an important part of moral education in the professions, but if they are the principal part they reinforce parochial and technical conceptions of professional life. Practical ethics tries to relate professional rules and clinical experience to the broader social context in which professionals practice, and to the deeper moral assumptions on which professions depend.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAmong the questions we have found significant are conflicts between duties of professional roles and those of general morality; conflicts within professional roles arising from competing understandings of the purposes of a profession; the duty of professionals to serve the public good; the legitimacy of professional authority; and the accountability of professionals. To address these kinds of questions, we have further sought to relate professional ethics to some of the larger questions prominent in recent philosophy such as the relativism of justice, the foundation of rights, and the limits of morality.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA second feature of practical ethics we have emphasized is its institutional context. Most people live most of their lives under the influence of institutions - schools, corporations, hospitals, media organizations - working for them or coping with them in one way or another. Yet ethics, both as an academic discipline and as concrete practice, has tended to focus either on relations among individuals, or on the structures of society as a whole. It has neglected that middle range of intermediate associations, of which institutions are the most durable and influential. Institutions are the site of many of our most difficult moral problems, as well as the source for many of our most promising solutions. We need to pay attention, for example, not just to the ethics of doctor-patient relations, or to the justice of health care policy, but also to what might be called hospital ethics. On what basis should hospitals allocate scarce beds in the intensive care unit? What rights should professionals and other employees have to dissent from a hospital\u0027s policy on, for example, AIDS precautions or physician-assisted suicide? To address such questions adequately, practical ethics must go beyond the moral principles of individual ethics, yet pay attention to the moral life that dwells among the structures of society.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThrough the years, we have also recognized that many of the issues that professionals face go well beyond the practice of their profession. That is one reason we have devoted at least as much attention to more general ethical issues, such as the questions of war and peace, global justice, environmental responsibility, the problem of immigration, standards for political campaigns, and the role of religion in public life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe third characteristic of practical ethics that has become increasingly important is its political nature. Practical ethics is political because it cannot avoid the question of authority: who should decide? The distinction between the right decision and the right to make the decision is especially significant in practical ethics because people reasonably disagree about many ethical issues - for example, abortion or capital punishment. Practical ethics has to provide principles for resolving, or at least accommodating, such disagreement. It is not simply a matter of choosing a particular procedure (majority rule, informed consent, shareholder proxies, and the like) to settle such disputes fairly but finally. We have found it more illuminating to think of the problem as involving a process of deliberation - continuing interaction in which the way the disputants relate to each other is as important as the question of who has the right to make the decision in the end. Practical ethics in the professions is also political in another, more familiar sense: it addresses the question of who should regulate the ethics of the professions. This question takes on new significance as the tension between the ideal of the self-regulating profession and the reality of market-oriented professionals becomes increasingly salient. We should be reluctant to abandon the ideal since it has traditionally expressed the principle of service to others, which is the ethical essence of a profession. But patients, clients, customers and citizens are legitimately seeking more control over the professions, sometimes through the market, and sometimes through politics and the law. Professional ethics, as many professionals themselves insist, is too important to all of us to be left only to professionals. The pressing challenge for the future is to forge, in principle and in practice, a union of the traditional idea of the autonomous profession (preserving its ethics of service) and the modern demand for accountability (acknowledging an ethics of responsibility). Beyond the professions, the challenge is to find the principles and practices that will enable all of us to acknowledge what we owe to one another in the public life that we inevitably share. The ethics of public life is too important to be left only to ethicists.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/practical-ethics-new-dynamics/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4460988_b01a_2.jpg","duration":"1.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"4,371.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Bachelor Degree Students","Masters Students","PhD Research Scholar","Layers","Researchers","Social Workers","Teachers","Medical Practitioners"],"tags":["Ethics"],"rating":{"count":3,"averageValue":"3.4"},"instructors":[{"name":"Dr. Swati Chakraborty","url":"/user/swati-chakraborty-5/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":3.6666667}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"FREE_PRAETHI_523","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/microsoft-azure-cloud/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4805730,"title":"Getting started with Azure Cloud","shortDescription":"Learn how to deploy, automate, secure and architect cloud applications with Microsoft Azure cloud platform.","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EImportant notice: The current version of this course is a preview, thus it is not yet complete.

The focus of the course will be on four key services, including: Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), AWS Storage Solutions, and Elastic Load Balancers (ELB) integrated with Auto Scaling Groups (ASG). \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAmazon EC2 is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It allows users to launch virtual machines (VMs) on demand and pay only for the compute resources they use. In this course, we will explore the different types of instances available, as well as how to launch, configure, and manage EC2 instances.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn addition to the EC2 service, we also explore AWS storage solutions including Elastic Block Store (EBS), Elastic File System (EFS), Snapshots, and Amazon Machine Images (AMIs). EBS is a block-level storage service for use with EC2 instances. It provides persistent storage for data that needs to be frequently accessed. EFS is a file-level storage service for use with EC2 instances. It allows users to create and configure file systems that can be accessed from multiple instances. Snapshots are point-in-time copies of EBS volumes that can be used for backup and recovery. AMIs are pre-configured virtual machine images that can be used to launch EC2 instances. In this course, we will explore the different storage options available and how to use them to manage data on the AWS platform.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOnce students have a handle on the foundations, we explore more intermediate topics relevant to workload distribution through the integration of ELBs and ASGs. Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs) are used to distribute incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances. They automatically scale to handle incoming traffic and can also be used to improve availability and fault tolerance. In this course, we will explore the different types of load balancers available, as well as how to configure and use them to distribute traffic across multiple instances.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWe will demonstrate how to integrate the ELBs with Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs) to ensure workloads are only distributed to healthy nodes within the EC2 service. ASGs allow users to automatically scale the number of EC2 instances in response to changing demand. They automatically launch and terminate instances based on predefined rules, ensuring that the number of instances is always sufficient to handle incoming traffic. In this course, we will explore how to configure and use ASGs to automatically scale the number of instances on the AWS platform.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThroughout the course, we will use hands-on exercises to help students gain practical experience with the AWS platform. Students will have the opportunity to launch and configure EC2 instances, create and manage storage volumes, configure load balancers and auto scaling groups, and work with other AWS services. By the end of the course, students will have a solid understanding of the AWS platform and will be able to use it to build scalable and reliable cloud-based applications.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-elastic-load-balancing-with-auto-scaling-groups/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4925158_0612.jpg","duration":"8 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"7,097.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Students interested in learning the foundations of AWS","Students interested in Cloud Computing","Students interested in exploring the Amazon EC2 Service","Students interested in exploring various EC2 Storage Solutions (EFS, EBS)","Students interested in setting up Highly Available cloud setups using ELBs, and ASGs on AWS"],"tags":["Cloud Computing","Amazon Elastic Block Store","AWS Elastic Load Balancing"],"rating":{"count":33,"averageValue":"4.4"},"instructors":[{"name":"YouAccel Training","url":"/user/youaccel/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.467742}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"YOUACCEL97668","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"\u20B9449","expirationText":"5 hours","discountPercentage":44}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/seo-guide-how-to-rank-higher-on-google-tareq-hajj/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5226416,"title":"SEO Guide: How to Rank Higher on Google","shortDescription":"Learn How to Manipulate Google\u0027s Algorithm So You Can Dominate Search Rankings","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EDo you want to learn the secrets of the mysterious Google algorithm?
