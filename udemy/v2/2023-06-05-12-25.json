To run a business at optimal capacity, you need to reduce or eliminate waste from processes and improve production flow. In this course, you\u0027ll learn about Lean strategies to reduce waste by determining which operations add value and which don\u0027t. You\u0027ll explore the concept of continuous flow, and discover how to balance work processes to make production flow more efficient. You\u0027ll define what waste is, where it exists, and what causes it. You\u0027ll also examine aspects of Muda, continuous flow, line balancing, value and non-value-add, and practical Lean techniques for improving Operations Management.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat is waste in Lean Manufacturing?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA core principle in lean methodology is the removal of waste within an operation. And in any business, one of the heaviest drains on profitability is waste. Lean waste can come in the form of time, material, and labor. But it may also be related to the utilization of skill-sets as well as poor planning. In lean manufacturing, waste is any expense or effort that is expended but which does not transform raw materials into an item the customer is willing to pay for. By optimizing process steps and eliminating waste, the only true value is added at each phase of production.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday, the Lean Manufacturing model recognizes 8 types of waste within an operation; seven originally conceived when the Toyota Production System was first conceived, and an eighth added when the lean methodology was adopted within the Western World.

Do children today use their imaginations as much as we did when we were kids? Do you see your children spinning incredible tales and stories in their fantasy play as we used to when we played \u201Ccops and robbers\u201D or \u201Chouse\u201D? Or does your child\u2019s fantasy play seem to consist only of repetitive movements which have no story to them? I am sure you are aware of such a situation\u2026 Nowadays children are no longer as creative as they once were.\u0026nbsp; We live in an era obsessed with numbers, data, and test scores, especially as they apply to our kids and their education.\u0026nbsp; Seeing the decline in creativity should make us concerned about our children\u2019s capacities to innovate, problem-solve, and navigate new and unfamiliar situations. \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the world of child development, you may hear the phrases like \u201Ccritical thinking skills\u201D and \u201Ccreative problem-solving abilities\u201D when referring to goals for your child\u2019s cognitive development. What we are really talking about is\u2026 imagination. The way to create human beings with imagination is to provide them with opportunities to develop it for themselves when they are very young. These opportunities are found in one place and one place only\u2026 that is, play. Played with paints, playing with play dough, costumes, glue, and crayons. Making a mess. Exploring the woods. Splashing in a puddle. Wondering at a caterpillar you notice inching by you. Pretending to be a bird, gliding through the sky. All of these involve a great deal of imagination and development of their creative skills to many folds.\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, as parents, we must first learn the process of creative learning which we can offer to our kids. We parents should make ourselves aware of the different aspects of creative learning and critical thinking skills so that we can create an environment for our children to flourish in that environment.\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; In this course, we are going to discuss in detail the step-by-step process which you can walk your children through to make them creative learners and achievers.

Employees used to get annual performance reviews as part of the performance management process. In recent years, research has shown that frequent feedback is more effective than annual reviews, so many companies have dropped the annual review model for regular manager check-ins and informal feedback sessions. By making small adjustments over time instead of trying to make one big course correction at the end of the year, this type of performance management can help employees understand and align with company goals and objectives.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this master course I would like to teach the 5 major topics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

Are you stuck in tutorial hell? want to build your own CV but don\u0027t know how and when to start? If so, this is the right project for you. This course contains five projects for a reason. It covers the most common parts of every web project out there. Even if you are experienced as a developer, you should still give it a shot. and the projects are not similar and that\u0027s the surprise. Every project covers a certain topic.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EFirst of all, we are going to start with probably what every web project has which is the authentication system. It contains a couple of useful parts like validation, password hashing, sessions, and so on. And for the second project, we are going to take a look at the crud app which will help you manipulate data like a pro, set forms, update, delete and create data. The third project is all about building a URL shortening service and that\u0027s pretty simple and yet very practical. We are going to use a bit of Jquery on the way. For the fourth project, which is the largest one of them all, where we are going to integrate our code from the past project (auth system) and we are going to insert images and display them nicely. And that only leaves us with only one project, and that is the email sender that\u0027s one of the most important parts of any kind of development because it will teach you to send emails dynamically.
