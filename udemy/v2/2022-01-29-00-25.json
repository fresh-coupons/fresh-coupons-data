I have generated leads at only 6 rs per lead with the help of strategy shared by you and by optimising my business manager to be ready for apple restrictions in your Udemy course. I have a facebook and instagram page since last 1 and a half years for my music academy business. Before buying your course, My cost per lead used to be 35 to 50 rs per lead through my conventional targeting. But after I studied under you, I ran conversion ads for leads by targeting custom audience of people who engaged on my facebook and instagram page and 1% lookalike audience of these custom audiences in India and it worked like a magic. 6 rs per lead is very very cheap and I am saving lot of money.

Best practice is to use the Conversions API in addition to the Facebook pixel to help maximize the effectiveness of your website events.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Conversions API is designed to create a direct and reliable connection between marketing data (such as website events and offline conversions) from your server, website platform or CRM to Facebook. This marketing data helps power ad personalization, optimization and measurement on Facebook so that your ads are shown to people who are more likely to be interested in them. There are several options you can use to set up the Conversions API. Many integrations don\u0027t require a developer, and if you use a commerce platform such as Shopify you can set up the Conversions API in just a few clicks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThe Conversions API can help you to:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReduce your cost per action as a result of improved connectivity.

Learn Using Events Manager.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFacebook uses marketing data to show ads to people who are likely to be interested in them. One type of marketing data is website events, which are actions that people take on your website. For example, making a purchase or adding an item to their cart. As people interact with your business, integration methods like the Conversions API and Facebook pixel share those events with Facebook. Events help power your Facebook ads so you can reach a more relevant audience, provide a more personalized ad experience and optimize your ad campaigns towards better business outcomes. Events take place either as a result of Facebook ads (paid) or organic reach (unpaid).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EDAY 9: Learn How to Use, Setup \u0026amp; Optimise Facebook Aggregated Events\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFacebook\u2019s Aggregated Event Measurement is a protocol that allows for measurement of web events from iOS 14 users. Aggregated Event Measurement limits domains to 8 conversion events that can be prioritized for conversion optimization. So, please, learn with me Facebook Ads \u0026amp; Instagram Ads for 2022. If you optimize your ads for non-prioritized events, your ads won\u2019t deliver to and report on people who are opted-out of tracking on their Facebook or Instagram apps on an iOS 14.5 or later device. Facebook solution is analogous to Apple\u2019s Private Click Measurement, but it is designed to solve for key advertiser use cases not addressed by Apple\u2019s proposal. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EDAY 10: Learn Facebook Reach Ads\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reach objective maximizes the number of people who see your ads and how often they see them. Choose this objective if you want to build brand awareness, change brand perception or show your ad to as many people in your audience as possible. With this objective, you can choose to maximize your reach or impressions for the entire duration of your campaign. You can set frequency controls for how many times a person sees your ad and the minimum number of days between each time they see it. For example, let\u0027s say you want your ads to reach a large proportion of your target audience to help increase sales. You can also tailor your reach with location targeting to reach people within a certain radius of your business location.

Python environment, where you can perform highly specialized financial analysis. You will get acquainted with technical and fundamental analysis and you will use different tools for your analysis. You will get acquainted with technical and fundamental analysis and you will use different tools for your analysis. You will learn the Python environment completely. You will also learn deep learning algorithms and artificial neural networks that can greatly enhance your financial analysis skills and expertise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis tutorial begins by exploring various ways of downloading financial data and preparing it for modeling. We check the basic statistical properties of asset prices and returns, and investigate the existence of so-called stylized facts. We then calculate popular indicators used in technical analysis (such as Bollinger Bands, Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), and Relative Strength Index (RSI)) and backtest automatic trading strategies built on their basis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next section introduces time series analysis and explores popular models such as exponential smoothing, AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), and Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) (including multivariate specifications). We also introduce you to factor models, including the famous Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and the Fama-French three-factor model. We end this section by demonstrating different ways to optimize asset allocation, and we use Monte Carlo simulations for tasks such as calculating the price of American options or estimating the Value at Risk (VaR).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the last part of the course, we carry out an entire data science project in the financial domain. We approach credit card fraud/default problems using advanced classifiers such as random forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, stacked models, and many more. We also tune the hyperparameters of the models (including Bayesian optimization) and handle class imbalance. We conclude the book by demonstrating how deep learning (using PyTorch) can solve numerous financial problems.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/python-and-machine-learning-in-financial-analysis/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4248756_2478.jpg","duration":"20.5 hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"27,934 students","lastUpdated":"Last updated 9/2021","targetAudiences":["Developers","Financial Analysts","Data Analysts","Data Scientists","Stock and cryptocurrency traders","Students","Teachers","Researchers"],"tags":["Development","Data Science","Python"],"rating":{"count":125,"averageValue":"4.3"},"instructors":[{"name":"S.Emadedin Hashemi","url":"/user/emha-4/","totalNumberOfStudents":27934,"totalNumberOfReviews":125,"averageRating":4.3140407}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"55A68B8F01F751F4AF70","originalPrice":"6\u00A0720\u00A0\u20B9","discountedPrice":"Gratuit","expirationText":"4\u00A0jours","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/java-collections-framework-learnit/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":3619180,"title":"Java Collections Framework \u002B Generics, Lambdas \u0026 Stream API","shortDescription":"Learn Java Collections Framework from scratch to PRO level with practical exercises","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EFrom this course, you can learn \u003Cstrong\u003EJava Collections Framework, together with Generics, Lambda Functions, Method References, and Stream API. \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are a lot of other courses on this topic. \u003Cstrong\u003ESo, why would you choose exactly this course?\u0026nbsp; \u003C/strong\u003EHere are just a few reasons:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E- Coding examples\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo learn to program is not enough just watching videos and reading books.
