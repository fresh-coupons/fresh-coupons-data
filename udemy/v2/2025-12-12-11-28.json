Starting with an introduction to machine learning and the unique capabilities of TensorFlow, students will gain foundational knowledge that sets the stage for more complex concepts. The course begins with installation and setup instructions to ensure every student is equipped with the necessary tools and environment for TensorFlow development. Early modules cover the essential building blocks of TensorFlow, including tensors, operations, computational graphs, and sessions. Through these topics, students will understand the core components of TensorFlow and how to utilize them effectively for simple projects and data operations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs the course progresses, learners dive deeper into neural networks, exploring how to build, train, and optimize basic models. The intermediate section introduces Keras, the user-friendly API for TensorFlow, allowing students to design and train complex models more intuitively. Topics like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) provide hands-on experience with real-world data types, such as images and sequences. The course then transitions to advanced topics, covering essential skills for deploying and scaling models. Students will learn to save, load, and serve TensorFlow models, enabling them to apply their knowledge in production environments. They\u2019ll also explore distributed TensorFlow for scaling applications across multiple devices and TensorFlow Extended (TFX) for building end-to-end machine learning pipelines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith practical projects and real-world applications woven throughout, students will have the chance to build models for tasks like image classification, sentiment analysis, and time series prediction, solidifying their skills through hands-on practice. By the end of the course, learners will be equipped not only with the technical knowledge but also the practical experience needed to implement, deploy, and manage TensorFlow models in professional environments.

Hosted by Ron and Samantha Mosca of \u003Cem\u003EA Perfectly Imperfect Marriage\u003C/em\u003E, this faith-anchored program draws from their own harrowing testimony of betrayal and recovery, transforming personal pain into a beacon for your path forward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnvision a marriage once fractured by hidden struggles\u2014addiction\u0027s grip twisting love into isolation, resentment into walls too high to scale\u2014now reborn as a testament to redemption\u0027s power. Ron and Samantha share vulnerably how their crisis tested every fiber of their covenant, yet through surrender to Christ\u0027s healing touch, they unearthed tools that mended not just the breaks, but the beauty beneath. This isn\u0027t polished theory from afar; it\u0027s raw, relatable wisdom forged in the fire, reminding you that addiction doesn\u0027t define your story\u2014God\u0027s grace does. With an empathetic tone that meets you in the mess, the course whispers encouragement at every turn: You\u0027re not alone, you\u0027re not irreparable, and your \u0022perfectly imperfect\u0022 union is primed for glory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt its heart, the program explores addiction\u0027s profound ripple effects on the soul and relationship, blending compassionate insight with biblical anchors like Proverbs\u0027 call to guard the heart and Ephesians\u0027 blueprint for tender forgiveness. You\u0027ll uncover how to navigate the labyrinth of rebuilding: from fostering empathetic understanding that honors the wounded without excusing the wound, to cultivating honest dialogues that dismantle shame and rebuild safety. Discover grace-filled practices for releasing bitterness\u2014not as a one-time event, but as a liberating rhythm that frees both hearts to breathe again. The journey extends to rekindling connection, where vulnerability becomes your ally, weaving emotional, physical, and spiritual threads into a tapestry of renewed intimacy that echoes the Song of Solomon\u0027s passionate pursuit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPractical and prayer-soaked, the content equips you with gentle yet powerful steps: vulnerability exercises that invite curiosity over control, daily habits rooted in mutual confession and celebration (inspired by James\u0027 wisdom on healing prayer), and rituals that mark milestones of progress with joy rather than judgment. It\u0027s designed for the weary spouse holding the fort, the recovering partner stepping into light, or the duo daring to dream of oneness anew\u2014offering tools that empower without overwhelming, always pointing back to the Savior who bore our deepest fractures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECouples who\u0027ve walked this road emerge not as survivors, but as overcomers: trust fortified like roots after rain, laughter reclaiming its place at the table, and a love that testifies to redemption\u0027s reach. This course isn\u0027t about quick fixes or flawless facades; it\u0027s about embracing the slow, sacred work of becoming whole together\u2014where addiction\u0027s shadow gives way to the dawn of unbreakable alliance. If your marriage aches for the peace that surpasses understanding, this is your compassionate companion, inviting you to trade chains for the freedom found in faithful pursuit.
