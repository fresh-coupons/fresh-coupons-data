It has a close resemblance in ways of its capability with Microsoft\u0027s Visual Basic, Sun\u0027s Tcl, the UNIX-derived Perl, and IBM\u0027s REXX. As a whole, script languages are easier and faster to code unlike the more structured and compiled languages such as C and C\u002B\u002B. Though script languages take longer to process than compiled languages, they are very useful for shorter programs. JavaScript is lightweight and so is most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow the web pages to be\u00A0more user interactive. \n\n  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELiveScript as it was known earlier, JavaScript made its first appearance in Netscape 2.0. The core of the language has been implanted in Netscape, Internet Explorer, and other web browsers. JavaScript is designed majorly for creating network-centric applications. It balances and integrates with both Java and HTML. Client-side JavaScript is the most common form of the language. This helps in making a web page not just a static HTML, but more user interactive. User-initiated events such as button clicks, link navigation, and other actions that the user initiates openly or implicitly can be done using JavaScript. Apart from its increased interactivity, it provides rich interfaces to webpages and can provide immediate response to the visitors.\u00A0 There is also lesser server interaction using JavaScript. JavaScript does not require any expensive tool to start working, a simple text editor like Notepad is enough.\n\n  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAll these qualities make it a very important tool for someone who is interested in creating dynamic web pages.

We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables.

While biologists have made great strides in discovering things on Earth, there are still many new things to learn. The first fundamental questions are: What is Life? What does it mean to have life? These inquiries are essential to the discoveries that biologists find every day. With such a vast scope of information, biologists must organize these discoveries that will stand the test of time.

It incorporates biology, physics, chemistry, and other academic disciplines. Life is multidisciplinary and is driven by chemical processes. Since so many biology topics overlap with basic principles of chemistry, you need a basic understanding and appreciation of chemistry to fully understand biology. For example, in Unit 1, we discussed that the atom is the first part of the biological hierarchy. In this unit, we provide an understanding of this foundational level of organization.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBiological Molecules\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBiological molecules are the essential molecules needed for life. These molecules can be organic or inorganic. Organic chemistry is the study of carbon, which is an element that forms strong covalent bonds essential for the foundational structures of all living things. Water, salts, acids, and bases are mostly essential inorganic molecules that facilitate many biological processes. All organisms contain organic biological molecules \u2013 carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and nucleic acid \u2013 that are essential to life.

In this unit, we explore the characteristics, components, and functions of cells. Learning about the structures of cells allows us to see the similarities and differences among organisms. Bacteria, plant, animal, and fungus cells are similar in many ways and contain many of the same small structures known as organelles. However, some characteristics help distinguish whether a cell belongs to an animal, plant, fungus, or bacteria. For example, all plant cells contain cell walls, while animal cells lack this particular extracellular structure. The water within a cell that presses against the cell wall gives a plant its rigidity and your celery its crunch!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eclassification\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClassification is a fundamental concept in biology.

Where does all that biomass come from? How does it get the energy to grow? Photosynthesis is the fascinating process plants use to convert light energy to chemical energy.
