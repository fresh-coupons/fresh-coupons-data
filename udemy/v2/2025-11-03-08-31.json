Softwares Practically. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAutodesk Revit is a building information modelling software tool for architects, landscape architects, structural engineers, mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) engineers, designers and contractors. The software allows users to design a building and structure and its components in 3D, annotate the model with 2D drafting elements, and access building information from the building model\u0027s database. Revit is 4D building information modeling application capable with tools to plan and track various stages in the building\u0027s lifecycle, from concept to construction and later maintenance and/or demolition.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake your Revit skills to the Advanced level. First, get comfortable with the Revit environment, and learn to set up a project and add the grids, levels, and dimensions that will anchor your design. Then we dive into modeling: adding walls, doors, and windows; creating and mirroring groups; linking to DWG files; and working with floors, roofs, and ceilings. I will also shows advanced techniques for modeling stairs and complex walls, adding rooms, and creating schedules.
