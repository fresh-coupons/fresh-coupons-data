He makes every other course seem like a prologue and I know I am going to be the confident, well prepared speaker that I always sought to become. The magnitude of material and the pieces of golden wisdom are so practical to today\u0027s environment. It hardly seems possible that a teacher of this quality would be so giving and available to the average person like myself, when he is qualified to coach Kings and Dignitaries. Only one-third through the course and already my Charity fundraising efforts are more effective because I have gained skills to improve my communication, both my message and my delivery. The clarity of TJ Walker\u0027s delivery demonstrates his message in action. Follow him on Facebook and YouTube for greater depth if you find yourself improving from absorbing his work as I have. Do the assignments promptly and you will improve with each session. Worth the investment of time and that is what I value most, TJ WALKER delivered value with each session, and made the most of my time.\u0022\u0026nbsp;Debbie Tudor\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat others say about the instructor:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u201CTJ Walker\u0027s single-minded devotion to presentation has made him the #1 expert for executives seeking guidance on speaking to the public and media.\u0022 \u003Cem\u003EBob Bowdon, Anchor/Reporter, Bloomberg Television\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u201CTJ Walker is the leading media trainer in the world.\u0022 \u003Cem\u003EStu Miller, Viacom News Producer\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(TJ Walker\u0027s Media Training Worldwide) \u201CThe world\u0027s leading presentation and media training firm.\u0022\u003Cem\u003EGregg Jarrett, Fox News Channel Anchor\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/how-to-deliver-an-elevator-pitch/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/364026_36eb_2.jpg","duration":"10 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"25,607.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Entrepreneurs ","Job seekers","Executives"],"tags":["Communication Skills","Investor Pitching","Personal Branding"],"rating":{"count":191,"averageValue":"4.6"},"instructors":[{"name":"TJ Walker","url":"/user/tjwalker2/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.529851},{"name":"Media Training Worldwide Digital","url":"/user/media-training-worldwide-digital/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.529851}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"D07A3F5750179C569F86","originalPrice":"\u20B92,299","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-guide-in-html-css-build-responsive-website/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5641604,"title":"Complete Guide in HTML \u0026 CSS - Build Responsive Website","shortDescription":"The best course for learning the basics of HTML and CSS from scratch.","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EAre you ready to unlock the world of web development and design?

This module will help you to understand the complex theory behind the Delta Wye transformer connection as I aim to build your strong concept through phasor diagrams. After this module you will be able to draw Delta Wye connection of transformer. By the end of this part, you will have a strong idea on voltage phasor diagram for delta connected transformer.

This section will teach you how Wye connection is made on windings of transformer, what are different ways to configure Wye connection. To give you a better understanding of Wye Wye transformer connection, I discussed the difference of line and phase current in both windings of transformer. Furthermore, you will learn how voltage and current quantities are calculated in addition with the rules for balanced system, and how balanced sets are created by phasors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly, I will explain Circulating Currents and Voltages for Delta Wye connected transformer. Very simple power system is modelled as an example to calculate current and voltages during a faulted condition. For the practical model, you will learn how to calculate both phase and sequence current and voltages, how to relate sequence network diagram with hand-calculated short circuit currents. Furthermore, you will learn how current flows through the Delta Wye transformer connection.
