Menu items are explored and explained. Alternative routes to doing the same actions are also explained. Examples are worked through at a very good pace and the videos are not overwhelming. There is no homework, which means that you can actually focus on soaking in the material. Feel free to stop, edit your own confluence and explore, without the pressure of an assignment behind it. I thought everything in the video was helpful and even learned a couple new tricks on how to structure my spaces. There are a variety of use-case scenarios that give you an idea of how to use this tool in different ways (which happens to be my favorite part). Useful demonstrations on layouts, permissions, status changes, drop down menus and more. Confluence is a Canvass that can be used as a great communication platform.

A course for anyone who wants to build career in IT and Software Development","DevOps  What it is: DevOps is a set of practices and a cultural philosophy that automates and integrates the processes between software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) teams. It emphasizes communication, collaboration, and shared responsibility to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.  Key Concepts:  Automation: Automating tasks like building, testing, and deployment.  Continuous Integration (CI): Frequently integrating code changes into a central repository.  Continuous Delivery (CD): Automating the release pipeline to ensure code can be rapidly and reliably deployed to production.  Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Managing infrastructure in a declarative manner, often using code, to automate provisioning and management.  Monitoring and Feedback: Continuous monitoring of applications and infrastructure to identify and address issues quickly.","Version Control  What it is: Version control systems (like Git) record changes to files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.  Benefits:  Collaboration: Multiple developers can work on the same codebase without conflicts.  History Tracking: See the complete history of changes, who made them, and when.  Rollback: Revert to previous versions if needed.  Branching and Merging: Experiment with new features without affecting the main codebase.","CI/CD  What it is: CI/CD is a set of practices that enable rapid and reliable software delivery through automation.  Key Components:  Continuous Integration (CI): Developers integrate code changes frequently, triggering automated builds and tests.  Continuous Delivery (CD): Extends CI by automating the release pipeline, ensuring code is always ready for deployment.  Continuous Deployment: A step further where every change that passes automated tests is automatically deployed to production.","Why These Approaches Are Important  For Companies:  Faster Time to Market: Deliver new features and updates more quickly.  Improved Quality: Reduce errors and improve software stability through automation and continuous testing.  Increased Efficiency: Automate repetitive tasks, freeing up developers to focus on innovation.  Reduced Risk: Smaller, more frequent releases make it easier to identify and fix problems.  Better Collaboration: Improve communication and collaboration between development and operations teams.  For IT Managers and Developers:  Career Advancement: DevOps skills are in high demand, making professionals more valuable.  Increased Productivity: Automation and streamlined workflows allow for greater focus on meaningful work.  Improved Job Satisfaction: Reduced stress and greater ownership of the development process.  Enhanced Collaboration: Work more effectively with colleagues across different teams.

Scripture becomes less about information and more about transformation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThrough guided practices, meditation, journaling, and safe discernment, you\u2019ll learn how to slow down and \u201Creceive\u201D the Word rather than rush through it.

These threats, or risks, could stem from a wide variety of sources.  Here are the main focuses of risk management:  Identification: Finding potential risks that could affect your organization or project. This involves brainstorming, looking at past issues, and considering what might happen in the future.  Assessment: Determining the likelihood of those risks happening and how severe the impact would be if they did. This helps prioritize which risks need the most attention.  Control: Taking steps to reduce the likelihood of the risks happening or to minimize their impact if they do. This might involve things like putting safety procedures in place, buying insurance, or having backup plans.","Why is it important?  Minimizes losses: By identifying and managing risks, companies can reduce financial losses, protect their reputation, and avoid legal issues.  Improves decision-making: Risk management provides a framework for making informed decisions, considering potential downsides and opportunities.  Enhances resilience: It helps companies to be prepared for unexpected events and to bounce back quickly from setbacks.  Increases the likelihood of success: By addressing potential problems proactively, companies can increase their chances of achieving their goals.","For managers specifically:  Protects their team: Managers are responsible for the safety and well-being of their team. Risk management helps them create a safe work environment and minimize potential harm.  Builds trust: Employees trust managers who are prepared and take steps to protect them from risks.  Improves performance: When risks are managed effectively, employees can focus on their work without worrying about potential problems.  In uncertain world, risk management is more critical than ever.
