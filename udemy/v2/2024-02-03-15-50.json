The software allows users to design a building and structure and its components in 3D, annotate the model with 2D drafting elements, and access building information from the building model\u0027s database.

In Python, OOP allows developers to organize code into reusable, self-contained objects that encapsulate data and behavior. These objects are created from classes, which serve as blueprints for creating multiple instances.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe key concepts of OOP in Python include classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism. Classes define the structure and behavior of objects, while objects are instances of classes that can hold data (attributes) and perform actions (methods). Inheritance enables the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes, allowing subclasses to inherit and extend the properties of parent classes. Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated interchangeably, enhancing flexibility and code reusability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy using OOP in Python, developers can achieve modularity, abstraction, and code reuse, making it easier to build and maintain complex software systems. OOP facilitates the creation of modular, extensible, and maintainable code, promoting concepts such as encapsulation, separation of concerns, and code organization. Python\u0027s support for OOP provides a powerful way to design and implement scalable, efficient, and flexible applications.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/exercises-object-oriented-programming-in-python-oop-course/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/3506820_98b0_5.jpg","duration":"1 total hour","enrolledStudentsCount":"30,900.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["programmers or developers who want to deepen their understanding and practical skills in object-oriented programming (OOP) using Python","students or individuals with a basic knowledge of Python who want to learn and practice OOP concepts and techniques in Python","software engineers or professionals who want to enhance their ability to design and implement complex software systems using OOP principles in Python","python developers who are transitioning from procedural programming to object-oriented programming and want to strengthen their skills in this paradigm","self-learners who prefer a hands-on approach to learning and want to practice implementing OOP concepts and designing classes and objects in Python","developers from other programming languages who want to learn how to apply OOP concepts specifically in the context of Python programming"],"tags":["Object Oriented Design","Object Oriented Programming","Python","Programming Fundamentals"],"rating":{"count":102,"averageValue":"3.9"},"instructors":[{"name":"Pawe\u0142 Krakowiak","url":"/user/krakowiakpawel9/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.15}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"FREEDROP7","originalPrice":"\u20B93,699","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/200-exercises-programming-in-python-from-a-to-z/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":3047152,"title":"Python Programming: 200\u002B Exercises for Practice","shortDescription":"Boost Your Python Proficiency with 200\u002B Engaging Exercises - Unleash Your Coding Potential and Excel in Python!","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Python Programming: 200\u002B Exercises for Practice\u0022 course is an immersive, hands-on learning experience designed for individuals who want to hone their Python programming skills through practical exercises.

It talks and explains the networking basics which is much more helpful for the beginners who are new to the world and domain of networking. This OSPF Certification course of Routing Protocol OSPF builds a strong foundation for them to prepare for good level certifications like CCNA. You will be able to learn all the terminologies and key functionalities related to routing protocols. There is n number of routing protocols that are developed today but only very few have been adopted by the industry. In this course, all those concepts will be explained in detail and you can practice them at your ease. The broad areas to be covered are related to configurations, operations, and troubleshooting. Apart from that, there are a few use cases of two very popular Routing protocols that work on the principle of OSPF and have their level of advantages. This OSPF Certification Module describes how to connect and configure and operate Open Shortest Path First which was specifically designed for IP networks and therefore supports IP tagging and sub-netting of extremely derived information related to routing. It also allows the packet-based information and authentication to take place and also makes use of the multicast for Internet protocol when either sending or receiving any packet\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis course module named Routing Protocols RIP and EIGRP is quite similar to the one used above and is also responsible to teach you many basics and fundamental concepts such as those related to troubleshooting, operation, and configuration. The two most important routing protocols which will be explained in detail are the RIP also known as Routing information protocol and the other is EIGRP which is the abbreviated form for Extended interior Gateway protocol. In the RIP protocol, the oldest of the vectors for distance IP Routing protocols are still put to use and thereby getting various enhancements. There are currently two versions that exist for the RIP viz. RIPv1 and RIPv2. RIPv1 is also said to be the classful protocol which means that it is not classless whereas if you talk about the RIPv2, it is considered to be the classless support routing protocol and IPv6 is the one whose support is extended to RIPv2 with the next-gen RIP which is also termed as RIPng. EIGRP, on the other hand, is related to the Interior Gateway protocol as it is a proprietary protocol of the company CISCO. This protocol is occasionally described as the distance vector routing protocol which also acts and imitates like a link state-oriented protocol. Distance vector-based protocols share everything of which they are aware of. The only limitation they carry is that the amount of information shared is only among the neighbors which are directly or indirectly connected with each other. Link state-based protocols announce that the information present is only about the direction and not indirectly connected links. However, they are also responsible to share the routing protocol information among themselves in all the areas they deem fit among all the routes in their domain or area.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/cisco-ospf-hands-on-certification-training/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4844382_3644_3.jpg","duration":"10.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"15,182.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["The target audience for this course is anybody who has a keen interest in the field of digital communication and is also aware of how the basics of understanding the networks and other routing protocols and mechanisms such as OSPF Routing.
