Whether you\u0027re curious about AI, looking to break into the world of language models, or want to become an LLM engineer, this course is your gateway to understanding and building with powerful tools like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and LLaMA. We make technical concepts simple and relatable using clever food metaphors\u2014so you can go from kitchen newbie to AI chef in no time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll explore how LLMs are built, trained, deployed, and evaluated through easy-to-understand analogies. Imagine tokenization as chopping vegetables, training as baking at scale, or prompt engineering as seasoning a dish just right. Each module is carefully crafted to introduce a new skill, from data preparation and fine-tuning to evaluation and deployment. By the end, you\u2019ll be fluent in core LLM concepts like model architecture, pretraining, transfer learning, prompt optimization, model evaluation metrics like perplexity and BLEU score, and deploying your own LLM-powered applications using tools like FastAPI, Gradio, Hugging Face Spaces, and LangChain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis course is perfect for students, educators, creators, entrepreneurs, and professionals from non-technical backgrounds who want to learn AI fundamentals and build real-world applications powered by large language models. We take you step by step through the AI lifecycle\u2014starting from \u0022What is a language model?\u0022 all the way to deploying your own chatbot, summarizer, or recommender app. You\u0027ll learn to use no-code tools, experiment with real prompts, fine-tune existing models, evaluate outputs, and even explore career paths like prompt engineer, AI product manager, and LLM architect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo coding experience is required.

You will study cognitive models such as \u003Cstrong\u003EACT-R\u003C/strong\u003E, \u003Cstrong\u003ESoar\u003C/strong\u003E, and \u003Cstrong\u003ELIDA\u003C/strong\u003E, and learn how AI researchers integrate \u003Cstrong\u003Esymbolic reasoning\u003C/strong\u003E with \u003Cstrong\u003Eneural networks\u003C/strong\u003E to create hybrid systems capable of abstract understanding, generalization, and transfer learning. Modules on \u003Cstrong\u003Emulti-agent systems\u003C/strong\u003E, \u003Cstrong\u003Eemergent intelligence\u003C/strong\u003E, and \u003Cstrong\u003Eembodied cognition\u003C/strong\u003E reveal how intelligence arises not only from computation, but from interaction, environment, and social dynamics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the advanced stages, you dive deeply into frontier technologies driving proto-AGI, including \u003Cstrong\u003Elarge language models (LLMs)\u003C/strong\u003E like GPT, Gemini, Claude, and Llama. You will explore \u003Cstrong\u003Ein-context learning\u003C/strong\u003E, \u003Cstrong\u003Eworld models\u003C/strong\u003E, \u003Cstrong\u003Emeta-learning\u003C/strong\u003E, \u003Cstrong\u003Econtinual learning\u003C/strong\u003E, and \u003Cstrong\u003Erecursive self-improvement\u003C/strong\u003E, developing a blueprint for how artificial systems acquire flexible, human-like capabilities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe course does not shy away from critical questions of safety and governance. Dedicated modules address \u003Cstrong\u003EAI alignment\u003C/strong\u003E, \u003Cstrong\u003Evalue learning\u003C/strong\u003E, \u003Cstrong\u003Ecorrigibility\u003C/strong\u003E, \u003Cstrong\u003Einterpretability\u003C/strong\u003E, and global \u003Cstrong\u003EAI governance frameworks\u003C/strong\u003E. You will examine theories of \u003Cstrong\u003Econsciousness\u003C/strong\u003E, ethical debates about \u003Cstrong\u003EAI personhood\u003C/strong\u003E, and the economic and societal implications of AGI deployment. Topics such as \u003Cstrong\u003EAI safety\u003C/strong\u003E, \u003Cstrong\u003Eexistential risk\u003C/strong\u003E, \u003Cstrong\u003EAI policy\u003C/strong\u003E, and \u003Cstrong\u003Eresponsible governance\u003C/strong\u003E ensure that learners are prepared not only to build intelligent systems \u2014 but to build them safely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe final phase of the program explores the future: \u003Cstrong\u003Equantum cognition\u003C/strong\u003E, \u003Cstrong\u003Eneuromorphic hardware\u003C/strong\u003E, \u003Cstrong\u003Ecollective superintelligence\u003C/strong\u003E, and \u003Cstrong\u003Epost-AGI civilization design\u003C/strong\u003E.
