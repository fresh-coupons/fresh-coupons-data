Of course, listening and speaking were the core abilities that we were accepted to a primary school.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd we all know that none of us teach our children how to pronounce vowels, consonants and words like the lessons we get in a language learning school?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut how did we learn to speak and to understand what we hear when we were a child?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my opinion, one of the reason is that we hear words many times. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen we hear the sound of a word many times, we will have enough sound information in our memory and then our brain will send the right command to our speaking organs how to produce that sound.

The good news is there is another way to quickly and effectively learn a second language.\u00A0 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00A0 \t\u00A0 You usually hear people saying that they can understand a lot more than they can speak. Do you know why? Well, language is a skill and not information. The only way you can develop a skill is by practicing and in this case that means repetition. You can be presented with information in form of grammar or explanations of sentence patterns and you can learn it, but that\u00A0 is only awareness, now you can recognize phrases or pattern or word sequences, but you cannot produce. The only way to develop your conversational skills is overlearning, i.e., repeating patterns until they are embedded into your subconscious mind.\u00A0 Repetition is the key to become fluent in a second language and that is what this course is about: to make you a fluent Spanish speaker\u00A0 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00A0 \t\u00A0 We keep the grammar at the lowest level and focus on over-learning.

A native doesn\u2019t need to think about what they need to say, they think about how to achieve their communication goals and they don\u2019t need to think about which words to use, that is subconscious.
