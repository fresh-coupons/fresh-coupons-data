course offers a comprehensive guide to the foundations of Adobe Lightroom CC, with a primary focus on the Lightroom Print, Slideshow, and Web Modules. We start right from the basics, where we explore the Lightroom interface and creating an image catalog. From there students learn to configure catalog settings while using the import dialog and import file handling. In this section students also learn to work with metadata presets, and preferences related to import options. Once students have a handle on the foundations, the course takes an in-depth look into file formats and color space. Here, we demonstrate the importance of understanding various image compression types and the quality vs size trade off. We discuss RAW vs JPEG vs TIFF files, along with color space comparisons between sRGB, RGB and CMYK. Students also learn the concept of image resolution and the importance of pixel density in determining image quality.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn section three, we complete our overview of the Lightroom interface by showcasing a few more essential features. This includes a number of file handling options, interface preferences, identity plate configuration, and watermarking.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOnce students have a firm handle on the foundations, the course transitions into exploring the Lightroom slideshow module. Here, students learn how to navigate the slideshow interface and create stunning slideshows from image collections using various slideshow templates. We also cover a number of tools to spruce up the overall look of a slideshow using text overlays, and embedded media objects such as music and video. Lastly, students will learn how to export a slideshow using various file formats and compression options. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAfter completion of the slideshow module, we dive into the print module. Here students will learn how to navigate the print module interface and setup print templates to produce studio quality images on both home and commercial grade printers. Students will learn important concepts such as soft proofing, page setup, layout style, custom templates, and print job configuration. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe last section of the course provides a quick guide to publishing image collections to the web, using the Lightroom Web module. We start with an overview of the interface before exploring various layout options and the color palette.

This course provides an in-depth overview of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). The EC2 service is an essential building block in becoming an AWS certified cloud practitioner. We will start with exploring key concepts relevant to EC2, followed by a hands-on practical guide to deploying compute resources on AWS. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe term \u201CScalable Cloud Computing\u201D has now become synonymous with Amazon Web Services. For nearly a decade, AWS has been powering some of the world\u2019s most popular websites and applications. Amazon EC2, is considered the computational backbone of AWS.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ETo illustrate how Amazon EC2 works, we explore the concept of virtualization. Virtualization is the process of creating a software-based virtual representation of a server. When we deploy an EC2 \u201CInstance\u201D we\u2019re creating a virtual representation of a physical server and it\u2019s resources.\u003Cstrong\u003E \u003C/strong\u003EThis includes: CPU, Memory (RAM), Storage, and network resources such as Bandwidth. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ESimilar to physical servers that you might find on-premises,\u003Cstrong\u003E \u003C/strong\u003Evirtual EC2 instances can also have different configurations. As a matter of fact, AWS offers the most comprehensive configuration options when it comes to deploying virtual servers.\u003Cstrong\u003E \u003C/strong\u003EThese configurations can easily be adapted to our resource needs, in real-time.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe level of customization a cloud provider can accommodate, will define the sophistication level of it\u2019s overall service. Not all cloud services were created equal. AWS, is known to have the highest level of configuration options when compared to just about any other service.

Includes JSX, Callbacks, Events, \u002B More","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EThis course takes you step-by-step through the process of building a fully functional calculator in React. React, also known as React JS, is a powerful JavaScript library used for building custom, interactive user interfaces using UI components. Some of the most well known examples of organizations using React for their front-end include Netflix, Facebook, and Airbnb. Developed and maintained by Meta along with a community of independent developers, React remains free and open-source. React is a component based library built entirely on JavaScript, which makes it perfect for designing complex UI\u2019s. With React, developers can build encapsulated components that efficiently manage their own state and render UI updates specifically when data changes. For example, think of the automated content refresh feature you see on a twitter feed, or facebook like button. Here the state of the UI component changes on the page, without having to manually refresh when the data is updated. This is just one small, yet powerful feature of React.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThrough a complete hands-on project, this course will teach you all the fundamental principles of React that you must know to become a proficient React developer. We start right from the basics, including the tools needed to get started. From there we dive into JSX, functional components, props, callbacks, and various OnClick events. By this stage, the calculator will have a complete visual display, coupled with functional arithmetic operations. Students then move on to passing parameters in Callback functions, using the React State Hook, and debugging.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn addition to the hands-on React module, we also offer a comprehensive overview of JavaScript for those who need a refresher. Here we start with introducing students to the document object model (DOM) which defines the logical structure of HTML documents. From there we dive into JavaScript to demonstrate various methods in which DOM elements can be manipulated to add interactivity to static components. We start right from the basics, which includes JavaScript placement, and data output. From there we move on to variable declaration, arithmetic operations, operator precedence, data types, and objects. Once the foundations are covered, we move on to more complex operations using Arrays, Conditional Statements, JavaScript comparison operators, booleans and loops. Here students will learn to unleash the true power of JavaScript to render different outcomes based on user interaction. We will explore the use of functions to efficiently handle repetitive tasks and JavaScript events to handle output based on actions and occurrences. The section will conclude with a hands-on project where students will implement their knowledge to build a web based photo gallery and background color changer. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAs you can see this course covers a tremendous bit of ground.

How does a seemingly simple combination of text and images create an interactive and dynamic user experience? The answer lies in the trinity of web development: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Together, these three technologies form the backbone of modern web design and development, enabling the creation of engaging, accessible, and responsive websites.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn this introductory course, we will delve into the essentials of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a solid foundation for aspiring web developers. By the end of this course, you will have a strong understanding of these technologies and be well-equipped to embark on your journey in web development.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHTML: The Structure of the Web\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/strong\u003EHTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the cornerstone of any webpage. At its core, HTML provides the basic structure and content of a webpage. It uses a system of tags and attributes to define elements like headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more. These tags act as containers for content, allowing developers to create a meaningful and organized layout for their webpages.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you begin your study of HTML, you will learn about the key elements that make up the structure of a webpage. These include the doctype declaration, the html element, head and body elements, and a variety of content-specific tags. You will also explore semantic HTML, which emphasizes the use of meaningful tags to convey the purpose and structure of content, ultimately making the web more accessible and search-engine friendly.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECSS: Styling the Web\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/strong\u003EWhile HTML provides the foundation of a webpage, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) brings it to life with style and flair. CSS is a stylesheet language that allows developers to control the visual presentation of HTML elements, including colors, fonts, layout, and even animations. By separating content (HTML) from presentation (CSS), developers can create consistent and maintainable designs across multiple webpages.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThroughout this course, you will explore various CSS properties and selectors that allow you to target and style specific HTML elements. We will cover topics such as the box model, positioning, typography, and responsive design principles. You will learn how to create external stylesheets, enabling you to easily apply consistent styles to multiple webpages. Ultimately, you will gain an understanding of how to create visually appealing and accessible web designs.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavaScript: Interactivity and Dynamic Content\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/strong\u003EThe final piece of the web development puzzle is JavaScript, a powerful and versatile programming language. JavaScript breathes life into your webpages by enabling interactivity, dynamic content, and real-time updates. With JavaScript, you can create responsive user interfaces, validate user input, and even build complete web applications.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn this section of the course, you will learn the fundamentals of JavaScript, including variables, data types, functions, and control structures. You will explore the Document Object Model (DOM), a programming interface that allows JavaScript to interact with and manipulate HTML and CSS. Additionally, you will gain insight into key concepts such as event handling, asynchronous programming, and AJAX.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EBy understanding how JavaScript interacts with HTML and CSS, you will have the ability to create dynamic and engaging web experiences that respond to user input and adapt to different devices and screen sizes.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPutting It All Together\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/strong\u003EAs you progress through this course, you will work on various hands-on projects that will help solidify your understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These projects will challenge you to apply the concepts you have learned, allowing you to create functional and visually appealing webpages.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EBy the end of this foundational course, you will be well-prepared to tackle more advanced web development topics, such as responsive design, accessibility, performance optimization, and even server-side programming.

In this course, you will learn how to effectively manage and optimize your storage on Amazon Web Services (AWS). This includes a comprehensive overview of the main forms of EC2 storage offered by AWS, including Elastic Block Store (EBS), Elastic File System (EFS), and Amazon Machine Images (AMI).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe course starts with the foundations of AWS, where we demonstrate how to register an AWS account. Students also learn the basics of AWS billing, global vs. regional services, and AWS multi-factor authentication (MFA). \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOnce students are familiar with navigating the AWS dashboard, we dive into working with the EC2 service. Here we explore the core features of EC2 instances, along with instance deployment, instance administration, and security. Students will learn how to create and deploy instances from Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) that are fully equipped with Elastic IP addresses, and remote access via terminal and PuTTY. We also cover a host of other integral concepts including IAM roles for EC2, Security Groups, and EC2 Instance Launch Templates. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAfter the EC2 section, we delve into AWS EC2 storage solutions. Here, we start with exploring the key differences between block, file, and object storage. From there, we take a deep dive into Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS). EBS is a block storage service provided by AWS which allows for the creation of virtual disks, called EBS volumes that can be attached to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances. These EBS volumes can be used as raw block devices, in order to store data, such as system files, application data, and virtual machine images. We will cover how to create, attach, and manage EBS volumes, as well as how to use EBS Snapshots to create point-in-time backups of your data. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EFrom there, we explore Amazon Machine Images (AMIs), which are templates that contain the software configuration and data required to launch an EC2 instance. We will cover how to create and customize AMIs, as well as how to use the EC2 Image Builder to automate the creation of AMIs. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn the last section, we introduce students to the Elastic File System (EFS), which is a file storage service provided by AWS. EFS allows you to create a file system that can be accessed by multiple EC2 instances to store and share files across multiple availability zones. We will cover how to create and manage EFS file systems, as well as how to mount EFS file systems on your EC2 instances. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EBy the end of this course, you will have a solid understanding of the various storage options available on AWS, and you will be able to confidently choose the right storage solution for your needs. You will also have the skills and knowledge to effectively manage and optimize your storage on AWS, ensuring that your data is safe, secure, and accessible.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIf you\u2019re excited about learning everything you need to know about AWS EC2 storage, hit the enroll button and let\u2019s get started.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/master-amazon-ec2-storage-complete-guide-for-ebs-efs-ami/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4925150_1295.jpg","duration":"5.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"8,743.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Students interested in Cloud Computing with AWS","Students interested in learning the foundations of Amazon Web Services","Students interested in Mastering the Amazon EC2 Service","Students interested in Mastering EC2 Storage Solutions: ELB, EFS, AMI"],"tags":["Cloud Computing","AWS Config"],"rating":{"count":17,"averageValue":"4.4"},"instructors":[{"name":"YouAccel Training","url":"/user/youaccel/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.382353}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"YOUACCEL80086","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"\u20B9449","expirationText":"5 hours","discountPercentage":44}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-java-to-master/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5138676,"title":"Learn Java to Master","shortDescription":"Explore this course to convert yourself to build Professional Java programs independently","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EHi, I am Suvarna from India.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe new course Learn Java to master is now live!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am here not only to teach you coding but also to love it when you code it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wish my every student should enjoy the programming process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is wide range of programmers who earn only depending on the Java Java is there source of income and their Job is to make real world Java applications-as smartly as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo stand strong in this competition ,you need to be very smart and passionate programmer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach and every topic is covered in detail with theory and practical part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis includes everything from variables and array to packages and interfaces and from Generics to AWT and Swing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter learning complete course you will be able to understand Java with every possible aspect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd also code real world Java applications easily.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only thing you have to do is completely learn the course thoroughly and do hard work for practical.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo that you will have confidence to build Java programs from your own.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you for being here.

When a human being ascends the steps of the pyramid, self-actualization is reached. Beyond the routine of needs fulfillment, Maslow envisioned moments of extraordinary experience, known as peak experiences, profound moments of love, understanding, happiness, or rapture, during which a person feels more whole, alive, self-sufficient, and yet a part of the world. This is similar to the flow concept of Mih\u00E1ly Cs\u00EDkszentmih\u00E1lyi. The concept of flow is the idea that after our basic needs are met we can achieve greater happiness by altering our consciousness by becoming so engaged in a task that we lose our sense of time.
