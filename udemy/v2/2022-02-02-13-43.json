How?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe will break down the very large concepts covered into digestible parts. We will organize those parts in a way in which they build on one another logically, allowing us to develop our knowledge in a systematic, practical, and efficient way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe will approach each new section from a variety of angles, including:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00B7 PowerPoint presentations discussing the latest concepts in a discussion format\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00B7 Practice problem demonstrations using video recordings taken of presentations created using OneNote\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00B7 Excel problems we will demonstrate in a step by step process\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearners will have access to the PowerPoint presentations in PDF format.

In other words, by the time we get to advanced financial accounting, many instructors expect us to be able to visualize everything that has been learned up to this point, and only show the new concepts. In reality, even seasoned professionals will have a difficult time imagining all the complexities that can go on in a consolidation without the help of supporting tools like a trial balance to work with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe will show the trail balance, show each journal entry in our practice problem, and post each entry to a worksheet so we can see the results as we go.

The course will also discuss regulations and regulatory institutions related to the audit process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe course will cover the planning process for an audit engagement. The planning process is a very important component of the audit because it will outline the steps that will be taking. The highest levels of the public accounting firm are generally involved in the planning process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe will consider how to assess risk related to the audit using an audit risk Model. The risk assessment will help us plan the audit and determine where the auditors time can be spent most efficiently to gather evidence to support the auditor\u2019s conclusion and opinion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearners will learn the different formats of audit evidence and how to document audit evidence so that it can be used as evidence to support the conclusion and opinion of the auditor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe will exam the internal controls of the organization. Internal controls are policies set up by management to achieve the objectives of the organization. As auditors, we are primarily concerned with internal controls that will lower the risk of financial statements being materially misstated. If we can rely on internal controls as an auditor, we may be able to do more testing of the controls and less substantive testing, and this can be more efficient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe course will discuss the audit sampling methods. When applying testing procedures, auditors often need to test a sample of a population and then apply the results to the population as a whole. Different sampling methods are appropriate for different situations and assertions being tested.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext, we will talk about substantive tests. Substantive tests include tests that most people think of when they think of an audit, like pulling files, counting inventory, and performing procedures at the company\u2019s place of business. Substantive testing will include testing account balances and transactions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe will then cover audit procedures related to specific processes, including the revenue process, the purchasing process, and the payroll and human resources process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext will cover the audit process for specific accounts like inventory, prepaid expenses, intangible assets, property plant and equipment, long term debt \u0026amp; equity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen we will discuss the audit process related to cash, cash being a very important account because it is involved in almost every other accounting process at some point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearners will then learn how to put together a standard audit report. The standard audit report is called an unqualifies report. It is beneficial to actually memorize or have a good idea of the format of the standard unqualifies report. We can then think about variations on the standard unqualified report, adjusting it as necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECPE\u0026nbsp;(Continuing Professional Education)\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELearning Objectives\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.
