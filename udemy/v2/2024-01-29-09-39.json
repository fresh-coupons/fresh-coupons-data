This is a comprehensive project based course where you will learn step by step on how to build a credit card fraud detection model using logistic regression, support vector machine, and random forest. This course is a perfect combination between machine learning and fraud detection, making it an ideal opportunity to enhance your data science skills. The course will be mainly concentrating on three major aspects, the first one is data analysis where you will explore the credit card dataset from various angles, the second one is predictive modeling where you will learn how to build fraud detection model using big data, and the third one is to evaluate the fraud detection model\u2019s accuracy and performance. In the introduction session, you will learn the basic fundamentals of fraud detection models, such as getting to know its common challenges and practical applications. Then, in the next session, we are going to learn about the full step by step process on how the credit card fraud detection model works. This section will cover data collection, feature extraction, model training, real time processing, and post alert action. Afterwards, you will also learn about most common credit card fraud cases, for examples like card skimming, phishing attacks, identity theft, stolen card, data breaches, and insider fraud. Once you have learnt all necessary knowledge about the credit card fraud detection model, we will start the project. Firstly you will be guided step by step on how to set up Google Colab IDE. In addition to that, you will also learn how to find and download credit card dataset from Kaggle, Once, everything is ready, we will enter the main section of the course which is the project section The project will be consisted of three main parts, the first part is the data analysis and visualization where you will explore the dataset from multiple angles, in the second part, you will learn step by step on how to build credit card fraud detection model using logistic regression, support vector machine, and random forest, meanwhile, in the third part, you will learn how to evaluate the model\u2019s performance. Lastly, at the end of the course, you will conduct testing on the fraud detection model to make sure it produces accurate results and functions as it should.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, before getting into the course, we need to ask ourselves this question: why should we build a credit card fraud detection model? Well, here is my answer. In the past couple of years, we have witnessed a significant increase in the number of people conducting online transactions and, consequently, the risk of credit card fraud has surged. As technology advances, so do the techniques employed by fraudsters. Building a credit card fraud detection model becomes imperative to safeguard financial transactions, protect users from unauthorized activities, and maintain the integrity of online payment systems. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and data-driven insights, we can proactively identify and prevent fraudulent transactions. Last but not least, knowing how to build a complex fraud detection model can potentially open a lot of opportunities in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow are things that you can expect to learn from this course:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn the basic fundamentals of fraud detection model\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how credit card fraud detection models work.

It was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994. The PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group. PHP originally stood for \u003Cem\u003EPersonal Home Page\u003C/em\u003E, but it now stands for the recursive initialism \u003Cem\u003EPHP: Hypertext Preprocessor\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPHP code is usually processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module, a daemon, or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. On a web server, the result of the interpreted and executed PHP code \u2013 which may be any type of data, such as generated HTML or binary image data \u2013 would form the whole or part of an HTTP response. Various web template systems, web content management systems, and web frameworks exist which can be employed to orchestrate or facilitate the generation of that response. Additionally, PHP can be used for many programming tasks outside of the web context, such as standalone graphical applications and robotic drone control. Arbitrary PHP code can also be interpreted and executed via a command-line interface (CLI).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe standard PHP interpreter, powered by the Zend Engine, is free software released under the PHP License. PHP has been widely ported and can be deployed on most web servers on almost every operating system and platform, free of charge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe PHP language evolved without a written formal specification or standard until 2014, with the original implementation acting as the \u003Cem\u003Ede facto\u003C/em\u003E standard which other implementations aimed to follow. Since 2014, work has gone on to create a formal PHP specification.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs of January 2021, 72% of PHP websites use discontinued versions of PHP, i.e. PHP 7.2 or lower, which are no longer supported by The PHP Development Team. A large additional fraction uses PHP 7.3, which is only (up to December 6, 2021) \u0022supported for critical security issues only.\u0022 Over 40% of all PHP websites use version 5.6 or older, which not even Debian supports (Debian 9 supported version 7.0 and 7.1).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBeginner Friendliness\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEasy to Get Started With\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPHP was designed to make web development easier, and many beginners find it effortless to pick up and get started with. In fact, PHP code was so easy to pick up, many non-programmers end up being able to hack PHP code together without truly understanding the code. While good programmers will never copy and paste code they don\u0027t understand, this speaks volumes about how easy it is to pick up PHP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe latest version of PHP (PHP8) has fixed a lot of inconsistencies and fatal errors as well. PHP has a wealth of learning resources, but you should make sure to avoid outdated tutorials.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFlexible\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPHP is a dynamically typed language.
