It\u0027s a diverse group of caregivers - they provide care in a bunch of different situations. Taking a step back, let\u0027s ask ourselves, \u201Cwhat is a caregiver?

It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables.

This course might become your first step to acquire skill set, knowledges and maybe even a whole new profession, that is appearing right now. Learning it today, gives you advantages tomorrow!  I\u2019m talking about digital transformation. In terms of customer communications in basically any meduim or big enterprises. And for small businesses, the most succesfull ones, they are already doing it in a modern way from the first day.  This transformation - it is a moving away from old way of communications, like phone calls, email, or even fax - to new way - whatsapp, facebook messenger, instagram direct messages, telegram - any messaging apps that people are using in their everyday life. And now they are starting to us\u0443 it to talk to businesses. To chat with an online store, with a bank, medical clinic - with any organization out there.","All of these companies need employees or contractors who understand how to make this shift, this transition. New channels on the one hand bring a lot of new possibilities, such as chatbots and artificial intelligence, and on the other hand, require a rebuilding of current business workflows.  For example agent\u2019s KPI in a contact centre based on whatsapp, is very different from a voice-based CC. And somebody need to know how to deal with it.  But the contact center is not the only place where apps like whatsapp are taking over. It affects pretty much every customer related departpent: sales, marketing and loyalty, support, customer experience, automation and online services.  So, Whether you plan to tie your career or business entirely to this feild, this knowledge will help you achieve your professional goals in a variety of ways. Because communication - is the essential part of business.  I started this journey seven years ago, when it was hardly even existed. Since then, I have worked with some of the world\u0027s biggest clients, such as Societe Generale, British american tobacco and others. Now I\u2019m a founder of a startup called brandy. im  I invite you to my course where you will learn the basics about communications of the future. Welcome!","Before we start I want to give a quick intro of myself and also let\u2019s take a look on the course plan.  So without further ado, here is what we will discuss  The course consists of 2 parts:  In a first one, everything down lesson 4, we are talking about the key benefits for business in general.  And then learning the basics of chatbots and AI.  The second part is becoming more specific.  We will see how exactly it implies to different departments. Discuss business application of particular messaging channels.  And with all of that we are getting ready to meet the main framework \u2013  of ideal customer journey in modern channels.

Zero trust architectures simplify network infrastructure, make users happier, and keep cyberthreats at a distance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince John Kindervag, then at Forrester Research, coined the phrase, zero trust architectures follow the maxim \u0022never trust, always verify.\u0022 To block inappropriate access and lateral movement throughout an environment, zero trust architecture enforces access policies based on context\u2014including the user\u0027s role and location, the device they\u0027re using, and the data they\u0027re asking for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA zero trust architecture means you know who\u0027s using what, and you can track it, including encrypted traffic; you need to monitor and verify the traffic between parts of the environment; and you need multifactor authentication (MFA) that goes beyond passwords.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn important thing to remember is that in a zero trust architecture, a resource\u0027s location isn\u0027t as important as before. Rather than rigid network segmentation, software-defined microsegmentation protects your data, workflows, services, and such anywhere, in your data center or distributed hybrid or multicloud.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy using a network-centric data security strategy that provides specific access only to those who need it, Zero Trust Architecture focuses on the business needs and functionality of an organization. By enabling parameters to dictate access and restrictions, the Zero Trust model views data security from a whole new perspective. As opposed to legacy networks that have little to no visibility or control over network and data usage, Zero Trust Architectures see all network traffic through segmentation gateways with granular policies governing access to data, apps, and assets. There are certain rules that have to be followed before a resource can be accessed in a Zero Trust network.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe five major topics I want to cover in this master\u0027s course are\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.
