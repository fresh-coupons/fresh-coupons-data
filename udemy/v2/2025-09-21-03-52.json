It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E*\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E javascript course contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript introduction\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript array\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript variables\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript functions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript objects\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript control statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript cookies\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript loop statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript data structures\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript error handling\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript regular expressions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003Esection 3- learn PHP\u0026nbsp;programming language\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis section will learn the basic structure of a web application and how a web browser interacts with a web server.

This will give you experience with specialized tools before deciding on apps that you think are right for your organisation. There are many project tools and specialized programs to choose from.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the essential tools you, and your project team, are going to need is the Gantt chart. The Gantt chart is a critical tool used to schedule and monitor a project\u2019s timeline. You will use this tool to visualise task durations, schedules, and progress. There are various software solutions out there but being able to create a Gantt chart enables you to build something specific to your project.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA Gantt chart is an invaluable tool that will help you and your team better understand the workflow through visualisation. The Gantt is also an effective communication tool. You can communicate to your team and stakeholders the progress of the phases and tasks of a project. The Gantt chart can be part of stakeholder reporting and included with status reports.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou will learn how to plan the layout, add formatting, and include conditional formatting to your Gantt chart. This will provide you with excellent visualisation of the project timeline as well as the task durations. Your team will easily be able to view the progress of the project and have no difficulties in understanding the information.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe course also provides tutorials that will help you understand the limitations of spreadsheet software. In future, you may decide to work with dedicated Gantt software. But this course will provide you with the foundations to understand the charts and how they can be applied to projects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou will learn about the mistakes that project managers can make when applying Gantt charts to projects. You can enhance your management career by avoiding these mistakes and increase the likelihood of successful projects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnrolling on this course will allow you to progress through easy-to-follow tutorials broken down into short video lengths. You will easily be able to learn at your own pace. This course will take you through each step of creating a professional Gantt chart. You will learn how to create charts from scratch, develop your spreadsheet skills, and build your confidence working with project management tools.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe tutorials feature LibreOffice Calc as the spreadsheet software of choice. However, Microsoft Excel has the same functionality and you will be able to create the charts shown in the tutorials. The navigation may be a little different. You can also use other spreadsheet software of your choice. Experience working with project tools and software would be beneficial.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe course is not going to teach you all about project management. You should already have a good understanding of project management in practice either through experience or studies. The course will also not teach you how to use spreadsheet software or apps. You should be comfortable with the software of your choice and have some experience with using formulas and other functionality (e.g. drag and drop). You will be expected to have spreadsheet experience and be proficient with using software apps before enrolling on this course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis course is all about you developing on your existing spreadsheet, productivity, and project skills that most modern organisations will be looking for.
