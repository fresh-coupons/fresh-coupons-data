Whether you want to improve your Spanish skills in one area, know nothing at all, or want to go back to basics, this course covers multiple bases of the Spanish language such as speaking, reading, writing, listening, and more.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-spanish-now/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4067814_b5da_8.jpg","duration":"5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"58,484.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["People who want to learn Latin American Spanish","Spanish language learners","Language learners"],"tags":["Spanish Language"],"rating":{"count":351,"averageValue":"4.3"},"instructors":[{"name":"John Cordova","url":"/user/john-cordova-12/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.46}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"HELLO2026","originalPrice":"\u20B92,699","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"3 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/php-for-beginners-2021-the-complete-php-mysql-pdo-course/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":3893330,"title":"PHP for Beginners: The Complete PHP MySQL PDO Course","shortDescription":"Learn PHP MySQL and PDO  and Build a Complete Project","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to my full stack PHP, MySQL,\u0026nbsp;and PDO\u0026nbsp;course where you will learn everything you need to know about one of the most three hot technologies right now.

It involves leveraging digital technologies such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence, data analytics, Internet of Things (IoT), and others to streamline processes, enhance customer experiences, and drive innovation. Digital transformation isn\u0027t just about adopting new technologies; it\u0027s about reimagining business models and processes to stay competitive in the digital age.  Digital Business Development: Digital business development focuses on utilizing digital technologies and strategies to expand a company\u0027s reach, improve its products or services, and increase revenue streams. It involves activities such as digital marketing, e-commerce, online partnerships, and digital product innovation. Digital business development aims to capitalize on the opportunities presented by the digital landscape to grow the business and create new value for customers.","Unit economics is a fundamental concept in business that focuses on understanding the direct revenues and costs associated with a particular business model or product at a per-unit level. These \u0022units\u0022 can be customers, orders, products, or any other relevant metric. Analyzing unit economics helps companies and experts assess the sustainability and profitability of their operations.  Here\u0027s why learning about unit economics is crucial for both experts and companies:  Sustainability and Profitability Assessment: Unit economics provide a clear view of whether a business is sustainable and profitable. By examining the revenue generated and the costs incurred on a per-unit basis, experts and companies can evaluate if they are making money or losing it with each sale or customer acquisition.  Scaling Decisions: Understanding unit economics is vital for making informed decisions about scaling a business. If the cost to acquire a customer is higher than the revenue generated from that customer over time, it may not be sustainable to scale the business without making changes.  Business Model Optimization: Unit economics analysis allows experts and companies to identify areas for optimization. It helps in finding cost-effective ways to acquire and retain customers, reduce operational costs, and increase average revenue per unit.  Investor Confidence: For startups and growing companies, demonstrating positive unit economics is often essential to attract investors. It shows that the business model is sound and has the potential for long-term profitability.  Risk Management: By understanding unit economics, companies can identify potential risks early. If the per-unit cost is too high, it may lead to financial instability or bankruptcy in the long run.  Pricing Strategies: Unit economics are key in setting appropriate pricing for products or services. Companies can determine the right balance between pricing and costs to maximize profitability.  Strategic Decision-Making: Business decisions related to product development, marketing campaigns, and resource allocation should be guided by a deep understanding of unit economics. It helps in focusing resources on high-impact areas.","Developing skills related to unit economics can be highly beneficial for building a career in various fields, including business, finance, and entrepreneurship:  Entrepreneurship: Entrepreneurs who understand unit economics can create and refine business models that are more likely to succeed. This knowledge is crucial for securing funding and effectively managing their startups.  Finance and Investment: Professionals in finance and investment need to evaluate the financial health of companies. An understanding of unit economics helps them assess the viability of potential investments.  Marketing and Sales: Marketers can make informed decisions about customer acquisition channels and campaigns based on the cost to acquire a customer and the customer\u0027s lifetime value. Sales teams can prioritize high-value leads.  Operations and Supply Chain Management: Professionals in operations and supply chain management can optimize processes, reduce costs, and improve efficiency by analyzing the unit economics of production and distribution.  Consulting and Advisory Roles: Consultants and advisors who can help companies optimize their unit economics are highly sought after. They can provide valuable insights and recommendations.  Unit economics is a critical aspect of business strategy and financial analysis. Learning about unit economics is essential for making informed decisions, ensuring a sustainable business model, and building a successful career in various fields related to business and finance."],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":128,"averageValue":"4.4"},"instructors":[{"name":"MTF Institute of Management, Technology and Finance","url":"/user/mtfinstitute/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.45}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"7A811C59529D7235C630","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"2 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/professional-certificate-in-procurement-and-purchasing/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5916870,"title":"Professional Certificate in Procurement and Purchasing","shortDescription":"Professional Certificate in Procurement and Purchasing by MTF Institute","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWelcome to course\u003C/strong\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003EProfessional Certificate in Procurement and Purchasing by MTF Institute\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECourse video lessons equal to course Professional Diploma in Procurement, Sourcing, Supply Chains\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/strong\u003Ewith difference in articles\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECourse provided by \u003Cstrong\u003EMTF Institute of Management, Technology and Finance\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMTF\u003C/strong\u003E is the global educational and research institute with HQ at Lisbon, Portugal, focused on business \u0026amp; professional hybrid (on-campus and online) education at areas: Business \u0026amp; Administration, Science \u0026amp; Technology, Banking \u0026amp; Finance. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMTF R\u0026amp;D \u003C/strong\u003Ecenter focused on research activities at areas: Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Data Science, Big Data, WEB3, Blockchain, Cryptocurrency \u0026amp; Digital Assets, Metaverses, Digital Transformation, Fintech, Electronic Commerce, Internet of Things. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMTF\u003C/strong\u003E is the official partner of: IBM, Intel, Microsoft, member of the Portuguese Chamber of Commerce and Industry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMTF \u003C/strong\u003Eis present in 208 countries and has been chosen by more than 400 000 students.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat are Procurement and Sourcing?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProcurement: The overarching process of acquiring goods and services that a company needs for its operations.
