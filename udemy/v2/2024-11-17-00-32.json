Exploring this topic is as challenging as it is interesting. But while there may exist many depictions and images on temples and tomb walls that describe in detail the pharaonic home and kitchen, as well as the kinds of foods offered on almost all occasions from the dawn of the Predynastic era, the ancient Egyptians did not leave behind any recipes. As such it remains difficult, as one can imagine,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eto specify weights, measurements, and methods of preparation with any clear precision.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDue to the specific cultural heritage of each area, ways of cooking may differ from one place to another, helping to individualize that region despite the similarity of ingredients. In Lower Egypt, or the Delta, for example, there has been a consecutive influence of Greeks and Romans, foreign immigration, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of these have directly impacted food and cooking habits as well as recipe variations, and the modern Egyptian kitchen in this region is the outcome of these influences.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut this has not been the case with southern Egypt (Upper Egypt and Nubia), where cooking methods and ingredients have likely remained\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eunchanged since the days of the pharaohs due to the relative lack of foreign influences in the area. Very early on in the project it quickly became apparent that cooking methods in Upper Egypt and Nubia\u2014regions that have always been strongly insular, adhering closely to ancient cultures and inherited traditions\u2014have retained a pharaonic influence in their simplicity, their tendency to use few ingredients and spices, and their preference for vegetables, grains, spices, and herbs indigenous to the region. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Es noted earlier, the ancient Egyptians left few if any recipes, so the ingredients in this course have been slightly modified to suit modern tastes. While certain foods were not introduced into Egypt until after the pharaonic age (including sugar, lemon, tomatoes, chicken, and chilli, among others), they have found their way into the modern-day southern Egyptian kitchen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Pharaoh\u2019s Kitchen has been compiled with the aim of thoroughly exploring ancient Egyptian cooking, from both historical and social perspectives. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003EHome and Kitchen Pharaonic Homes \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E A\u003C/strong\u003Encient Egyptian houses differed according to the social and economic class of their residents, ranging from small, basic structures for peasants and laborers to more elaborate homes for artists, priests, and men of state, villas for nobles, and palaces for kings. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKitchen Planning and Cooking Tools \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehe kitchen was located at the back of the house and would be covered by a roof of straw or branches to simultaneously block out the scorching Egyptian heat and allow the escape of cooking fumes. In villas, the kitchen was located entirely outside the house. A grain storehouse would serve the kitchen, sometimes being located alongside it or on the roof where it could be reached by stairs.The kitchen area would be constructed along simple lines. In one corner there would be an oven covered in a layer of mud or a stove. There would also be one or two stone structures for the grinding of grains, or a tool \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPots and Vessels\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAncient Egyptians used the rich soil of the Nile bank to make pottery. The most essential and therefore most common were basic vessels made of mud and used for cooking or storing grains and liquids. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFood and Drink in Ancient Egyptian Society\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFertile Egyptian soil and the River Nile were main factors in helping the ancient Egyptians to cultivate a variety of plants and rear livestock. Food sources were diverse, and ancient Egyptians made good use of the different kinds of fish, vegetables, poultry, and fruits. The staple diet of most Egyptians consisted of bread and beer in addition to what produce the land yielded, such as onions, garlic, lentils, leeks, turnips, radish, lettuce, and cucumbers. Since the Predynastic period, ancient Egyptians, rich or poor, consumed various breads made from different grains. Flour would generally be mixed with a yeasting agent, salt, and spices, and sometimes with eggs and butter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe bread could also be filled with legumes or vegetables or sweetened with honey or dates. The ancient Egyptians also used a fair share of legumes such as beans, chickpeas, and lentils as well as vegetables such as peas, lettuce, garlic, onions, and leeks. Dates were the most common fruit, in addition to figs, grapes, pomegranates, watermelon and plums, all of which appear in depictions of daily life dating back to the New Kingdom. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFood and Social Status\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETypes of food eaten give a clearer picture of the different social levels in the ancient Egyptian hierarchy. In the poorest stratum fell the peasants whose staple diet was bread and beer, and a few simple dishes of vegetables the land generously yielded to them. When they had meat, it was mainly that of smaller farm animals since larger livestock were used in agriculture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMembers of the middle or working classes like construction workers, shipbuilders, and laborers were one rung higher on the social ladder, and their professions entitled them to daily rations. Their food varied between meat and fish with plates of vegetables, fruit, as well as the common factor of bread and beer. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESpecial Occasions\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDespite the abundant produce, perhaps the ancient Egyptian was not unlike the Egyptian peasant of today: content with his daily bread. Ancient Egyptians were easily satisfied with a few loaves of bread, a share of beer, some leeks, and onions. The numerous tomb reliefs that picture the many pleasures of food and drink were probably more indicative of the lives of the upper strata of society, like the higher civil servants, priests, landowners, and nobles. The masses would wait for feasts and special occasions for an excuse to indulge. They likely did not have to wait long as festivals were numerous, judging by the annual special occasions relating to the seasons, the Nile, sowing, harvesting, as well as coronations and funerals \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFood and the Gods\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ancient Egyptians identified spiritually with the forces of nature surrounding them, including the sun, moon, wind, the inundation of the Nile, the strength of fierce animals like lions, snakes, and crocodiles, or powerful animals that were of use to them like cows and bulls. There were many gods, one for each invisible force behind the phenomenon, thus becoming intertwined with the lives of the ancient Egyptians. They did not only worship tangible powers, but also less tangible ones symbolized by animals. For example, the force of wisdom was symbolized by the ibis of Thoth, and fertility by the bull.26 The deification of animals made them a symbol for a certain god or power, but it did not stop the ancients from using them for food, transport, or other purposes. Thus the cow was used for farming, and though the ancient Egyptians deified the crocodile, they didn\u2019t find anything \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Efood and language\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe hieroglyphs used by the ancients were numerous and pictorial: symbols of people, animals, tools and implements, as well as food items. The foods were not chosen randomly, but in fact were built on the importance of that symbol to the lives of the ancient Egyptians. Among the twenty-four letters of the ancient Egyptian alphabet, four are related to food: I was represented by a leaf of a plant. N was represented by water, the source of life. W was represented by a baby quail, one of the birds that were hunted. Quails are also migratory birds and so may have had special significance in certain times of the year. Finally, T was represented by a loaf of bread, the staple food. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBread \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBread was a staple of the ancient Egyptian diet, figuring in most depictions of offerings left in temples and tombs and on lists of desired\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efoods carried by the deceased. It was also considered an essential item to be buried with the deceased for the afterlife.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is therefore not surprising that we can count up to fifteen kinds of bread in the Old Kingdom. By the time of the New Kingdom, this number had risen to almost forty kinds of bread and baked items that differed in shape from oval, to round, twisted and concave, as well as in the kind of flour used whether made from wheat, barley, or corn. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBread-making\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAncient Egyptians stored grain in their houses after the harvest, or in silos made of mud. Peasants would construct grain storehouses that took the shape of a funnel. The hole on top was for putting in the grains and another one below was used to dispense grain for daily use. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETypes of Bread in Ancient Egypt\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAmong the different kinds of bread in Ancient Egypt were\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u2022 A white bread in the shape of a cone made for sacrificial offerings, called\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Et-hedj .

There were also other kinds of\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eround loaves with thick crusts, similar to a pizza. The center was decorated with an egg. Sometimes filling would be added between two layers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Elike a sandwich \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEggs and Dairy Products \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDairy Products\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDairy products were vital ingredients not only in the ancient Egyptian kitchen, but also in homemade medicinal ointments to cure ailments such as eye disease, among others. Ancient Egyptians raised sheep and cows for irtet (milk), from which they made cheese, butter, and cream. To increase the animals\u2019 milk production, the ancient Egyptians set proper feeding habits and forbade the use of female animals in agriculture. The peasants themselves were careful to ensure that milking occurred in an atmosphere of calmness and safety. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDairy Products in Modern-day Upper Egypt\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECottage cheese, butter, and ghee, which was called seimi (from which came the name ghee in modern Egyptian, samna) are still used in Upper Egypt today. Ghee is made by melting the fat left over from cream after having extracted the milk by churning. In this case morta is extracted, that is the solid matter dissolved in milk after melting the butter. Morta is used to make mesh (aged cheese) by putting it in clay vessels and topping it with ovendried cottage cheese and some lupine beans (today, red hot chilli peppers \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMeat \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELivestock and hunted animals were an important source of nutrition in ancient Egypt. The most popular kind was beef, and people carefully fattened up herds of bulls and calves for slaughter. These were closely\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efollowed by lamb, goats and, at the very bottom of the list, deer and mountain goats.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt first the ancients hunted game but it was not long before they began domesticating animals for different purposes of daily life. They made use of grazing lands that conveniently grew naturally in the swamps of the fertile Delta and the pastures that would appear after the Nile flood and would last for a few months. They also knew how to raise many animals such as bulls, cows, sheep, and goats. Tomb reliefs show many scenes of slaughtering animals, especially bulls, which, in addition to their much-coveted meat, were used for agricultural purposes such as ploughing the land and crushing corn as well as pulling heavy loads such as construction blocks. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPoultry\u003C/strong\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eas one of the main sources of food for ancient Egyptians, varying, as is the case today, from domesticated fowl to wild birds. In\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecities there were poultry merchants who raised birds and fattened them up in order to sell them. Game, the most popular of which was wild goose, was also hunted. Geese were also domesticated. Duck was a common bird and, along with geese, made popular grilled or boiled dishes gracing the banquets of kings and priests and people of status in the community. Scenes have been found depicting the process of fattening domesticated birds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther common birds were pigeons, quail, and ostrich, which were also domesticated. Pigeons were bred in silos of mudbrick, and their droppings used as fertilizer.

Quail, swans, sparrows, storks, and pigeons were fair game. Several methods were used to hunt birds. Boomerangs were known since the Predynastic period and were used in hunting swamp birds. Hunters hid in the rushes, waiting for the precise moment at which they could capture the bird by flinging their boomerangs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFish \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehe Nile was the backbone of ancient Egyptian life, providing water\u2014 both for drinking and agriculture\u2014a means of transport, and communication. There was an abundance of fish thriving in its waters. Many different varieties were available and the flooding of the Nile meant large catches that had to be preserved for storage by salting and drying. In some parts of the country, there were fish that were considered sacred, and couldn\u2019t be caught or eaten, like Nile perch or seasnake. In\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eother parts, it was taboo to eat fish on certain days of the year\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany tomb scenes depict fishing as well as different methods of preparing\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efish, including salting and drying.

During the Roman period up to twenty-five kinds of fish were identified, including pufferfish, seal, sand leaf, and electric fish.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ancient Egyptians excelled at preserving fish, salting, and dryingthem, as well as extracting roe.

A rod would be pushed through the mouth and the fish would be grilled over a fire. Fish could also be boiled in a pot filled with water, salt, and some spices. Certain kinds of fish were also smoked and salted. Salting was a convenient way to cook fish to avoid spoilage, especially in the hot weather, as it would keep fish edible for a very long time.

Of the most commonly cultivated were onions which were also used in medicinal recipes as well as on special occasions. Known as a popular food for layman as well as priest, onions were commonly used to flavor dishes. Herodotus even mentioned onions and bread as the staple diet for pyramid builders. Apicius reports that onion was used as an ingredient in a sauce for grilled fish.

Onions, which were eaten raw, comprised a large portion of the ancient Egyptians\u2019 vegetable intake, and it is believed the ancients ate many of their vegetables raw. That said, it is likely the ancients also cooked vegetables in pots and pans after the addition of meat and fat \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELegumes \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELegumes were, and still are, a popular food.

Types of legumes consumed were beans, peas, chickpeas, crushed wheat, lentils, lupine beans and fenugreek. Herodotus mentioned that lentils were eaten by pyramid builders in the Old Kingdom. They were also used to make bread and as feed for animals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFound in the tombs of the Fifth Dynasty were eyorti (Egyptian beans), a name similar to the one used in Egypt now, herati. The ancient Egyptians cooked different kinds of beans in various ways. Beans were cooked the same way as peas and were also used in making besara. The latter was prepared by boiling crushed beans, mashing them into a smooth thick paste, then adding spices and herbs such as cumin, dry and fresh coriander, salt, parsley, and dry Jew\u2019s mallow.

Melon was also often planted. Dates were eaten either fresh, or dried, and a type of wine was made out of them, just like the fig, which was also a popular fruit, eaten both fresh and pressed into wine. The soft part of the doum fruit, related to the palm, was eaten or the fruit was made into a dough or used as a sweetener. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBeverages \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecommon drinks were beer, bouza (fermented barley), wine, and milk (which was drunk fresh because of the hot weather).

Performance goals are specific targets or objectives that individuals or teams are expected to achieve within a given timeframe. These goals play a fundamental role in driving employee performance, aligning organizational objectives, and fostering continuous improvement. We will explore the significance of performance goals in the realm of human resources and the benefits they bring to both employees and organizations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Clarity and Focus: Performance goals provide clarity and direction to employees. When employees have clear goals, they know what is expected of them and can focus their efforts on achieving those objectives. Setting specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals helps employees understand the desired outcomes and enables them to prioritize their tasks effectively.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Motivation and Engagement: Well-defined performance goals have a motivational effect on employees. When employees have challenging yet attainable goals, they are more likely to feel engaged and motivated to perform at their best. Goals create a sense of purpose and provide a framework for employees to channel their energy and expertise towards achieving desired outcomes. They can enhance job satisfaction and increase employee commitment to the organization.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Performance Evaluation: Performance goals serve as a basis for assessing employee performance. By setting clear objectives, managers can evaluate and measure the progress and achievements of employees. Regular performance evaluations help identify areas of improvement, provide constructive feedback, and recognize top performers. Objective evaluation criteria linked to performance goals ensure fairness and transparency in the assessment process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Skill Development: Performance goals create opportunities for employees to develop and enhance their skills and competencies. By setting goals that require employees to stretch beyond their current capabilities, organizations can foster a culture of continuous learning and development. Employees are motivated to acquire new knowledge, acquire relevant training, and seek growth opportunities to meet or exceed their goals. This, in turn, benefits both the individual and the organization by building a skilled and capable workforce.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Alignment with Organizational Objectives: Performance goals play a crucial role in aligning individual and team efforts with the broader organizational objectives. When goals are set in line with the strategic priorities of the organization, employees understand how their work contributes to the overall success of the company. This alignment promotes a sense of organizational unity and helps employees see the bigger picture, fostering a collective effort towards achieving organizational goals. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Accountability and Performance Improvement: Performance goals create a sense of accountability among employees. When employees have clear goals and know they will be evaluated based on their performance, they are more likely to take ownership of their work and strive for excellence. Goals also provide a basis for identifying performance gaps and areas that require improvement. Managers can offer support, guidance, and resources to help employees overcome challenges and enhance their performance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerformance goals are a vital component of effective human resource management.

What is the purpose of studying how to lead a team? Aren\u0027t all leaders born and not made? If that is the truth, then millions of people are wasting their time trying to improve their leadership skills. Fortunately, trying to become a better leader is not a waste of time. While it is true that some leaders are born, most are made by studying what makes an effective leader.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this introductory unit, you will explore the four pillars of good management: management, leadership, groups, and teams. Management and leadership are often used interchangeably; the same applies for groups and teams. Management is about allocating resources; leadership is about empowering people. A group is a collection of individuals with a similar interest. Teams have a similar goal, but teams work together. A good leader will help a group and become a team\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo prepare you for this course, this unit concludes with a look at some great leaders in history. These four individuals are selected for their broad experiences and abilities to manage groups and teams. The spectrum goes from sports team management to inspiring political movements, and from brilliant corporate management to excellence in military and national leadership.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELeadership Theory\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPeople have studied leadership since ancient times, and theories of leadership have been around for centuries (Plato, Sun Tzu, Machiavelli, and so on). However, it wasn\u0027t until the 20th century that modern theories began to take shape. Today, researchers study leadership the same way that they study other aspects of psychology: they seek to get a better understanding of people\u0027s behavior and motivation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem with some of these theories is that they tend to contradict instead of complement each other. They seek to identify one set of rules or behaviors that turns someone into a leader. The reality is likely a combination of all the theories and some ideas that have yet to be defined. It is best to study these theories with an open mind and understand that they each have their own merits. Remember that emphasis should not be placed on any one theory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChange Management and Decision-Making\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe most difficult task for a manager is implementing changes without disrupting the whole business. Changes to the normal business operation will have supporters and protesters. It is important for a manager to understand the point of views from both sides. Sometimes the changes are minor, such as a new benefits plan. Other times major changes must be made, such as moving the operations across the country and laying off employees. The only certainty with change is that you cannot please everyone, but a good manager will anticipate reactions and focus on effective communication.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth major and minor changes are often the result of a decision-making process. There are many different ways to approach a decision, and each method has an appropriate time and place. Decisions can be based on dictatorial edicts, on a leader\u0027s decision derived from consultation with subordinates, or on a more collective process where everyone can develop and agree on the final outcome. These methods will be presented in this unit. In addition, one must also address the real probability that decisions, regardless of the process by which they are derived, will be clouded by any of a number of biases. We also present the most critical of those biases, including anchoring, groupthink, and selective perception, in this unit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELeading Without Formal Authority\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile many students of this course will go on to manage teams, organizations, and companies, everyone will have opportunities to lead without being granted any actual authority (called \u0022legitimate power\u0022). To leverage these opportunities, you must know what types of power exist and when to use them. For example, having expert power allows someone to step-up, because they have the most knowledge about a specific subject.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELeading without authority goes beyond power; the ability to influence without manipulation, emotional intelligence, and interpersonal skills are all important aspects of gaining power and leadership without having direct authority over a group or team. After studying these topics, you will be able to recognize when a leader takes over a situation and to determine who may be the best leader for a given situation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EManaging Groups and Teams\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhether your power base is legitimate or otherwise, you may find yourself potentially in a leadership position within a group or team. But what is the difference between a group and a team? This was touched on in the first unit, but further distinction is needed here. Groups are often formed organically. Think about a group of car enthusiasts: they come together because of a similar interest. There may not be an underlying goal other than to share ideas and discuss topics of mutual interest. Teams are formed more strategically. For example, think about a professional sports team; management carefully selects and trains players, and together they work toward the common goal of winning games.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETeams should function in the way a group does: with a more relaxed atmosphere, which will allow each contributor to feel comfortable in his or her role. Maintaining this atmosphere can be difficult, because teams sometimes work in very stressful environments. This is why building a good team with great dynamics is so important and so challenging. A team that functions well together will be more productive than a team that does not have a good dynamic. Thus, this unit will enable you to explore the world of teams and groups.
