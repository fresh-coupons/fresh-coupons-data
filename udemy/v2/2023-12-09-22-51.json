I started out my sales career in car sales. I loved it except I was only there to gain sales experience and I had to always be there to make a sale. I treated my car sales job as my college years. I was there 3 years, 10 months before I discovered brokering money. I sell other people\u2019s money to small business owners. I sell the sexiest product in the world. The one thing that 90% of the world is chasing, I am selling. It\u2019s perfect and you can do it from anywhere in the world. This isn\u2019t a get rich quick scheme so if you are looking for one, you\u2019ve picked up the wrong course. You will have to work, but you can easily make 7-6 figures doing this. I am going to help you avoid some of my mistakes and get to where you want to be quicker. Like I said in the beginning, I was a car salesman.

(More on that later) Once you find people who are in need of money you then connect them to our friends (direct lenders) who have money for sale. You make money in the middle. Your don\u2019t have to put up any of your own money to fund businesses. There\u2019s limited risk to you. Our job is to simply find people who need money for business purposes. As long as you can help people solve their money problems, you will never have money problems of your own. You can make money as soon as the Day after you get started. In this industry we can get businesses funding within 24 hours and we get paid from the direct lenders after the business is funded. In this course, you will learn how to find deals, how to sell and have the opportunity to work with me directly. \u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/business-loan-broker-product-knowledge-sales-marketing/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5462204_f50f.jpg","duration":"2 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"3,527.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["This course is for people who are looking for a career change or an opportunity to work for themselves from home.","Real estate professionals and Mortgage lenders do well in our industry","This course is great for people who are in car sales and are trying to get into a new industry","This course is for business bankers that want to work for themselves and provide loans for businesses"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":19,"averageValue":"4.6"},"instructors":[{"name":"Amir Towns","url":"/user/amir-towns-2/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.5}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"55B72A6307C338A31A09","originalPrice":"\u20B91,699","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"3 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/art-therapy-for-business-work-life-balance/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5642284,"title":"Art Therapy for Business: Work-Life Balance","shortDescription":"Art Therapy for Business: Work-Life Balance","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWelcome to course: Art Therapy for Business: Work-Life Balance by MTF Institute\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E!

Learn the simplex method, duality and sensitivity analysis for linear programs","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003ELinear programming is a widely used optimization tool in various applications (data science, engineering, transportation, supply chain, etc.). Linear programming also makes the basic foundation behind complex optimization tools like Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) and Column generation.

In the first section, we will introduce linear programming, and we will explore the convexity and types of optimalities. Then, in the second section, we will build up on the basics to learn ways to solve the linear program using the simplex method. We will then explore the concept of linear programming duality. We will also go through some of the hardest-to-understand concepts like strong duality, complementary slackness, and Farkas\u0027 lemma. Furthermore, we try to understand these concepts in an easy-to-follow way. This allows one to obtain lower bounds on the minimization problem and provide proof of optimality or Infeasibility. In the last section, we will explore how to perform sensitivity analysis (the effects of changing parts of a linear program). At the end of each section, there are assignments to help you evaluate your knowledge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you would have noticed, this course doesn\u0027t explore modeling optimization problems as a linear program much.

This technique is a form of horizontal scaling, which helps in managing large data sets and high throughput operations by spreading the load across multiple machines. Each shard holds a portion of the data and functions as a separate database, allowing MongoDB to scale out and handle more data and more queries than a single server could.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat is the primary purpose of using an index in MongoDB?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA.

Indexes support the efficient execution of queries in MongoDB. Without indexes, MongoDB must perform a collection scan, i.e., scan every document in a collection, to select those documents that match the query statement. Indexes are special data structures that store a small portion of the collection\u0027s data in an easy-to-traverse form. The index stores the value of a specific field or set of fields, ordered by the value of the field as specified in the index.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIn MongoDB, what does the \u0027Write Concern\u0027 setting dictate?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA.

It is a crucial setting that determines the guarantee of writes to the database. The Write Concern can be configured to return an acknowledgment after writing to a specific number of nodes in a replica set, ensuring data durability and consistency. Higher levels of write concern can protect against data loss in the event of a node failure but may impact the performance due to the increased acknowledgment requirements.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhich of the following is a core component of MongoDB\u2019s replication mechanism?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA.

It is a special capped collection that keeps a rolling record of all operations that modify the data stored in the database. Replica set members use the oplog to replicate data changes to other nodes. When a primary node performs a write operation, this operation is recorded in the oplog. Secondary nodes then replicate and apply these oplog entries in an asynchronous process. This mechanism ensures data consistency and high availability in MongoDB\u0027s replica sets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat is GridFS in MongoDB, and when is it used?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA.

Instead of storing a large file in a single document, GridFS divides the file into smaller chunks, typically of 255KB, and stores each chunk as a separate document. By splitting the file, MongoDB can manage and retrieve large files efficiently. GridFS also allows for partial retrieval of files, which means you can access portions of large files without having to load entire files into memory. \u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEnroll Now\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJoin our course today and take the first step towards mastering MongoDB and acing your next interview.
