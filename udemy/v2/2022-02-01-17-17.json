I never went to film school, I had to learn everything I know about filmmaking by making mistakes, on my own. And I will never regret I chose that route.

Imagine getting home from work, getting comfortable on a sofa in front of your tv, and scrolling through hundreds of tv shows and movies deciding what to watch. Subconsciously you will choose something that stands out from other films, and you will judge it by the poster. With years of making indie films and doing everything myself, I learned why my movies are not getting enough attention. That is not because of how good or how bad the movie is, sure it\u0027s important but it\u0027s not a deciding factor.

SEO has two key objectives. The first is to help you understand what online users are looking for - so that you can create high-quality content to serve their purpose. The second is to help you create a website that will be able to find, index, and understand its content through search engines. SEO can also put oneself ahead of the competition. If three or four websites are selling the same thing, the search-engine-optimized\u0026nbsp;(SEO) ranked website is more likely to have more customers and make more sales.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first stage in\u0026nbsp;SEO\u0026nbsp;is called \u0022technical SEO\u0022 in the process. Technical SEO, as the name suggests, has little to do with a website\u0027s actual content or with methods of website promotion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo make the job of search engine crawlers easier, it has to do with settings you need to customise. Usually, you do not have to deal with it again until you got your professional SEO right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn-Page SEO is the second stage or step. On-Page SEO mainly has to do with the content and other elements found on a page.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main objective of on-page SEO, unlike technical and off-page SEO, is to provide appropriate signals to search engine crawlers so that they can understand the importance and meaning of your content.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that content optimization is part of SEO on the website, but this is often referred to as \u0022SEO content\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOff-Page SEO deals with primarily \u0022Backlinks\u0022. Backlinks are a sign of confidence and they can dramatically influence your ranking status depending on where the links come from. Your ranking would be favourably impacted if the links come from well-known and trustworthy pages. Your ranking would be adversely affected whether they are paying links, links in article directories, link farms, or a consequence of an exchange.\u0026nbsp;Also, digital marketers should note that if the website rankings and organic traffic are growing, you are in the right direction, then this implies. If not, the SEO strategy and action plan will have to be updated.\u0026nbsp;You can always have an SEO checklist in hand, ready.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you believe you already have all the knowledge, guidance and skills outlined above, then this ultimate search engine optimization\u0026nbsp;(SEO)\u0026nbsp;quiz created by the King of Digital Marketing\u003Cstrong\u003E \u0022Srinidhi\u0026nbsp;Ranganathan\u0022\u003C/strong\u003E and \u003Cstrong\u003E\u0022J.

Animation specialists know that \u003Cstrong\u003E2D\u003C/strong\u003E is a more simple technique - whatsoever, so it\u0027s a lot easier to learn and execute, but it still takes just as much, and even often more, time to do than \u003Cstrong\u003E3D\u003C/strong\u003E. On top of that, 3D is a lot more complicated than 2D.\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s for this reason that many producers are looking into 2D production as an animation technique. It\u0027s a technique that is not new though, but quite the contrary - it has been around since the \u002750s, actually much longer. However, it\u0027s been in the past couple of years that 3D animation has risen to the top. Just look at all the movies that were nominated this year for an Academy Award and you\u0027ll see that most, if not all of them, are 3D. If you think about all those movies, for example, \u0022Life of Pi\u0022, \u0022Hugo\u0022, and \u0022Hayao Miyazaki\u0027s\u0022 movies (\u0022The Wind Rises\u0022 and \u0022Ponyo\u0022), they were all done in 3D. This past year saw a large rise in 3D movies than 2D movies, especially when you compare it to the years before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 3D\u0026nbsp;animation process normally has three phases associated with it being - the following stages:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E1. Pre-production stage:\u003C/strong\u003E\u0026nbsp;This process includes concept creation, creating rough storyboards, making script reels, and character modelling. This is the most difficult stage of it all and also it involves a lot of brainstorming to be done by a huge team who will be working on the animation project.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E2. Production stage: \u003C/strong\u003EThis involves the creation of the animated film\u0027s animated elements brought together layer-by-layer and scene-by-scene, all into one place, ready for the final touches to be done or applied. This is usually termed as the \u0022Creation Stage\u0022 too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E3. Post-production stage:\u0026nbsp;\u003C/strong\u003EThis stage deals with rendering of the 3D animation and editing the video using any video editing software like Adobe Premiere Pro, iMovie for Mac or Final\u0026nbsp;Cut Pro (FCP).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe above phases also have multiple sub-processes within them.\u0026nbsp;Thus, this makes 3D animation a complicated process - \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Euntil now\u003C/em\u003E!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EForget being an animation specialist or learning 3D\u0026nbsp;animation from scratch.\u0026nbsp;\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EWhat if we told you that you could create amazing 3D animation videos at high speed using the world\u0027s most powerful and secretive software?\u0026nbsp;What if we told you that this is all possible without modelling, texturing, rigging, lighting or manual animation unlike leveraging traditional animation software to create a 3D output? \u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis means simply speeding up the three phases that we just talked about above by 99x.

A classic example of viral content, the internet meme typically takes the form of a video or image of one or two lines of text. However, it is possible to spread virally any type of online content that appeals to users enough to make them want to share it. \u003Cstrong\u003EVideos go viral\u003C/strong\u003E because they connect with their audience and engage or wow them to the maximum potential.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe notion of viral content has two interdependent sides. \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EWhen a piece of content excites the viewers on the human side, it induces an emotional response to the point that they can\u0027t help but share it.

You have to ask with everything you create: would I care if this scrolled through on my newsfeed?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor various reasons, content goes viral. Keep that in mind. Entertainment value is a common feature; other features include usefulness, information, artistic merit, the promotion of points of view, and the value of shock.\u0026nbsp; Another viral content driver is the audience and reputation of the sharer. Social influencers have built an online presence on social media platforms such as Facebook, LinkedIn,\u0026nbsp;Pinterest, and Quora across multiple channels and large follow-ups are present in those streams.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGoing viral is a hard thing to do when it comes to advertising content. What will spark a post to make it go viral is not always obvious. Evidence suggests that content is not plain, but amplification.

The answer can already be found in the first sentence. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAudio social media systems appear to fulfil a long-held goal for free and democratic social media. Decentralisation offers a wide range of applications, from cryptocurrency to social media. Unlike podcasts or livestreams, social audio platforms are more of an open conversation than a monologue. Even if you\u0027re in a chatroom full of strangers, group voice chats feel strangely intimate. Audio social media platforms allow users a more democratic option to get their opinion heard in a world where platforms are becoming pay-to-play. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBrands may be able to test audio-based ad formats on audio social networks at some point in the future. They would also be able to \u0022sponsor\u0022 particular discussions, similar to how adverts appear on streaming radio and podcasts. Individual chat rooms would most likely have audio advertising \u2014 a company representative or host would provide a short commercial at the start, middle, and/or end of a conversation. Social audio platforms tend to draw niche audiences, ranging from astrology enthusiasts to side hustlers, providing the ideal opportunity for companies to get in front of their target audience in an audio format. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAccessibility is critical to the development of social media. Some apps or software as we know it are inaccessible to persons who are deaf or hard of hearing due to their audio-only nature. Discord has added certain accessibility features, including text-to-speech and greater screen-reader integration, in response to similar criticisms. Audio platforms must ensure that their platform is accessible to everyone in order to survive. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne way audio platforms keep users interested is through attracting influencers and celebrities who funnel their audience from other media.

This course teaches you the fundamentals of Six Sigma. It not just helps with change management within your company but also helps your organization to prepare for the new normal. Customer expectations or demands are constantly changing in this world governed by technology. Six Sigma\u0027s emphasis on customer satisfaction enables the company to produce higher-quality products and increase customer loyalty over time. A product-focused strategy compares the product to the products of competitors in order to reach or slightly exceed such levels. You must know that Six Sigma focuses on minimising process variation and improving process control, whereas lean encourages work standardisation and flow by eliminating waste (non-value added processes and procedures).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease note that to achieve success leveraging the Six Sigma methodology, organisational processes must have a failure rate of no more than 3.4 per million (99.99966%) chances. A Six Sigma defect is anything that isn\u0027t according to the client\u0027s specifications. Its goal is to reduce the amount of variation in commercial and production operations. The capacity to focus on producing quantitative and measurable financial gains from any Six Sigma project is one of the most notable features. Employees can identify problem areas as well as reoccurring difficulties that affect the overall quality expectation of a service or product from a customer\u0027s perspective using Six Sigma methodology.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy opt for this course - the proven game-changer?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy completing this\u003Cstrong\u003E \u0022Lean Six Sigma White Belt Online Course\u0022\u003C/strong\u003E, you will gain the basic understanding of what Lean Six Sigma is and how Lean Six Sigma brings a plethora of benefits to your organization.\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are a professional individual who wants to grow and sustain in this ever-changing competitive world (where speed is no longer just a good to have criteria) and want to discover a way to fit in the new norms with their employees - this course is for you to learn and master!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThis mind-blowing White belt course will walk you through unbelievable insights and learning that you don\u0027t want to miss at all as a newbie entering the world of Lean Six Sigma.\u0026nbsp;What\u0027s more?

The ultimate secret of the course is that we will also tell you about a tool that you can use for unlimited lead-generation using another secretive artificial intelligence\u0026nbsp;(AI) technology. There is often a disconnection between sales and marketing departments in many businesses. This is typically due to a lack of interaction or shared attention. Marketers may give sales a lead they believe to be ideal, but sales are not. It creates tension between two teams to work together, and AI is the perfect way to bring them together. AI can point out positive sales leads, which will also satisfy marketing, and ensure that potential customers are targeted at the right platforms. You don\u0027t want the company that sells accounting software to be advertised by someone. All teams will need to come together and agree on an optimal customer profile, a profile that fits marketing and sales, to better use AI in the B2B lead generation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe profile can consist of multiple variables, such as sector, company level, and how many employees they have. The standards are almost infinite. The AI will use the profile to measure current and potential leads against a selection of pre-defined behavioural criteria. Without us providing all this, the AI will fumble around, essentially throwing darts at a board while blindfolded. The AI can predict future patterns for lead generation, possible spending, and what campaigns or services will draw their interest from this.

Fitness businesses and members alike have invested in home new-age fitness equipment - and the fitness industry has shifted online to survive: gyms have improved their online offerings, and members have improved their home set-ups, investing in a variety of equipment, apps, wearables, and fitness trackers for the long-term. The use of social media in gym marketing has become a must. It\u0027s a channel via which people can quickly obtain information. They can provide gym-specific advice or information, thereby educating followers on health and wellness and boosting the active-living trend. Owners are rewarded with useful comments, allowing them to establish a solid business reputation, increase member trust, and attract new potential consumers by mentioning their brand online.
