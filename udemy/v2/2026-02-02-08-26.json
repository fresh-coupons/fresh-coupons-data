It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E*\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E javascript course contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript introduction\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript array\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript variables\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript functions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript objects\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript control statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript cookies\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript loop statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript data structures\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript error handling\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript regular expressions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003Esection 3- learn PHP\u0026nbsp;programming language\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this section, we will learn the basic structure of a web application, and how a web browser interacts with a web server.

COEs offer clustering and convert your nodes into one super computer, make intelligent\u00A0\u00A0decisions as to where to schedule the containers, connect containers running on different nodes by setting up multi host network and offer many other interesting features such as fault tolerance, zero downtime deployments etc.\u00A0\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKubernetes is the gold standard in the world of container orchestration. It was originally created by Google, based on their experience of building and managing containers at scale ( at Google Scale). However its now driven by Cloud Native Compute Foundation ( CNCF), an open body, which also offers the official certification i.e. \u0022\u003Cstrong\u003EKubernetes Certified Administrator\u003C/strong\u003E\u0022.\u00A0 Kubernetes comes with mind boggling features, is very reliable, and extremely sophisticated container orchestration engine. It can let you convert your infrastructure into a Container as a Service (Platform),\u00A0 brining in some of the awe inspiring features such as Zero Down Time Deployments, Fault Tolerance, Auto Scaling, Cloud and Storage integrations, which were extremely difficult to implement.\u00A0 And it brings it to the masses with its truly\u00A0open, lock in free\u00A0eco system.\u00A0\u00A0\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith Kubernetes\u0027 sophistication however, comes the complexity too. Even though I have been using Kubernetes for more than 2 years now, almost every month, I\u00A0find something new about kubernetes, something really cool, be it cloud integrations, or the newly introduced RBAC, be it dynamic storage provisioning, or stateful sets, its a fascinating world once you start exploring it. However, you would definitely need a guide once you while you navigate the complex world of Kubernetes, and this course serves just that. its been created in a way that you start learning kubernetes fround grounds up, one small step at a time, feature by feature.\u00A0\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis course\u00A0brings to you a distilled experience with my knowledge of building and managing infrastructures, experience of helping companies with their devops journey and more than 300 corporate trainings. This is a well researched program and I\u00A0have tried many variants of applications, with different flows, took feedback, and iterated many times. Thats one of the reasons why it took us more than 4 months to even launch the course in its first form.\u00A0 We\u00A0have also started incorporating some new and useful techniques including glassboard, mindmaps to explain the concepts better and make things easier.

Being the first to enter in 2005, Puppet is at the forefront of the IaaC revolutions and was the first tool amongst the four main configuration management tools including Chef, Ansible and Saltstack . Puppet is also the fastest configuration management system and provides a simple DSL (Domain Specific Language) to define the state of resources and does the heavy lifting of managing underlying platform specific operations by itself, providing users higher level of abstraction than scripts do.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe use of puppet is no more limited to servers, but has also expanded to managing all type of devices including routers, embedded systems, storage etc. With more and more organisations adopting to devops practices, knowledge on IaaC and tools such as Puppet is essential for today\u0027s generation of devops professionals.
