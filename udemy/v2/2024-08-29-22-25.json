Google, for example, deploys more than 12 billion applications monthly based on Kubernetes, including well-known services such as Search, YouTube, Gmail, Google Play, Chrome, among others.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently, Kubernetes is a phenomenon in the technology sector, being adopted by the most innovative companies due to its versatility, security, and performance. With Kubernetes, it is possible to deliver new software and updates in record time, meeting the demands of the modern internet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn summary, Kubernetes is a technology for orchestrating production-ready containers, according to the official definition of Kubernetes itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat is the difference between Kubernetes and GKE (Google), AKS (Azure), EKS (Amazon), ACK (Alibaba), among others?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe difference is significant, as GKE, AKS, EKS, and ACK are not Kubernetes themselves! Kubernetes is a container orchestration system, an independent, open, and free technology. This training will teach Kubernetes in its pure form, which can be fully reused in any environment with Kubernetes installed, whether locally or in the cloud.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn general terms, GKE, AKS, EKS, and ACK are products that use Kubernetes. They are provided as services by the companies Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alibaba, respectively, to create an environment (cluster) where you can run your Kubernetes applications outside your company, that is, in their cloud. This is known as Managed Kubernetes Platform.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn summary, Kubernetes is the underlying technology, while GKE, AKS, EKS, and ACK are managed services that facilitate the deployment and operation of Kubernetes clusters in their respective clouds. Each of these services has its own specific characteristics and integrations, allowing you to choose the most suitable for your needs. Learning Kubernetes is essential to stand out in the world of distributed cloud applications with containers, regardless of the chosen platform.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETherefore, GKE, AKS, EKS, and ACK are, in essence, environments to install Kubernetes.

The CNCF is a sub-organization of the Linux Foundation, a non-profit entity that also oversees the development of the Linux operating system.
