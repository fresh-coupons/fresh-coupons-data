Employees used to get annual performance reviews as part of the performance management process. In recent years, research has shown that frequent feedback is more effective than annual reviews, so many companies have dropped the annual review model for regular manager check-ins and informal feedback sessions. By making small adjustments over time instead of trying to make one big course correction at the end of the year, this type of performance management can help employees understand and align with company goals and objectives.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this master course I would like to teach the 5 major topics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.
