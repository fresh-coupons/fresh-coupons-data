I found this course created by TJ Walker a perfect introduction to the world of media training. I wanted to learn, not only what a media trainer does, but also what steps I would have to take in order to become a successful media trainer--TJ discusses all this in a clear and concise manner, in a tone that is welcoming and never alienating. The only constructive critique I would give would be concerning the technical form of the presentation, more specifically the video quality and picture aesthetic. Going by the current standard as it applies to video, everything we view is in high definition. Having said that, I believe the video quality could be improved upon as well as the backdrop which I found to be a bit generic and outdated. I found these minor flaws to be slightly distracting and given the high caliber of the speaker and the information being presented I believe these aspects detracted, if only marginally, from the quality of the product.\u0022\u0026nbsp;\u003C/em\u003ENick Cisik\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u00225 Stars!

That sometimes requires new tools. After Effects is known for animation, but it\u0027s also a powerful program for graphic designers. Its panels and basic features are similar to Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign, which makes After Effects easier for designers to learn. This course offers a unique workflow, combining Photoshop with After Effects to create stunning, unique, and professional-quality assets for print, web, and photography. Instructor Chris Converse \u2014 founding partner of Codify Design Studio \u2014 shows how to create special effects, add dramatic lighting to photos, color key images, build textures and patterns, and generate artwork from almost nothing, producing effects like water, bubbles, lightning, and rain. The course is for any designer\u2014even if you\u2019ve never used After Effects before. Chris demos each example step by step, and shows how the results can be used in real-world design projects.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/after-effects-for-graphic-design/","imageUri":"https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/1728034_542b.jpg","duration":"2.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"2,129.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Graphic Designers","Photographers","Illustrators","Web Designers","Ayone who wants to create visually stunning artwork"],"tags":["After Effects","Graphic Design"],"rating":{"count":43,"averageValue":"5.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"Chris Converse","url":"/user/chrisconverse2/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":5}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"2024-FEB-C","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"\u20B9499","expirationText":"1 day","discountPercentage":38}}},"freeCourses":{}}
