A successful manager is now expected to act as a leader, a mentor, and a coach, guiding their team members towards individual and collective success.

This shift stems from the recognition that employees perform at their best when they feel valued, supported, and empowered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe evolution of leadership expectations can be traced back to the changing dynamics of the modern workplace. In the past, managers were primarily responsible for enforcing rules and ensuring productivity. However, as organizations began to realize that employee engagement and satisfaction were crucial for success, a transformation in managerial roles ensued.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday, managers are not just tasked with overseeing tasks and projects; they are expected to inspire and empower their teams. This shift is partly a response to the changing nature of work itself.
