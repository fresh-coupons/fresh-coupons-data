Psychologists study the connections that may be made between brain function and behavior, as well as the connections that can be made between behavior and the external world. They then put what they have learned to use in order to expand our understanding, so making the world a better place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Generally Accepted Scientific Procedure\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECuriosity is a characteristic that we all have by virtue of being human. When children are initially taught to ask questions, one of the first ones they are taught to ask is \u0022why?\u0022 Even if we are adults today, we will never stop being curious about things. Using empirical approaches, psychologists apply their universal interest to the process of data gathering and interpretation in research, with the ultimate objective of better grasping and addressing some of the most challenging challenges that contemporary society faces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is difficult, if not outright impossible, to think of a facet of life in which psychology does not play a part. There is no area of existence in which psychology does not play a role. The scientific method is something that psychologists employ. This process entails raising a question, offering an explanation for it, and then carrying out thorough experiments in the laboratory or out in the field to support the hypothesis. Psychologists use the information they\u0027ve gleaned from their studies and apply it to the creation of evidence-based practices that may assist in the resolution of problems and the improvement of people\u0027s lives.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ultimate effect of the discipline of psychology research is that it finds new and better ways that people may thrive in an environment that is becoming more complex while still surviving in that setting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Implementation of Scientific Principles\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are several subfields that fall under the umbrella of the subject of psychology. Psychologists do research that is both theoretical and applied, serve as consultants to various communities and organizations, diagnose and treat patients, and teach students who will go on to pursue careers in psychology as well as those who will go on to professions in other disciplines. In addition to judging one\u0027s character, they examine one\u0027s cerebral capabilities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are a significant number of psychologists who work in the medical profession as well. They assess not only the mental but also the behavioral functions, in addition to the health of the individual as a whole. Other subfields of psychology look at the dynamics of human interaction with one another and with technology, with the intention of improving these dynamics via their research.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe use of psychological research has the potential to minimize the financial toll that sickness has on governments and society by teaching people on how to make choices that are good to their own health and well-being. Students that have difficulty grasping new material are able to make better use of the improvements that have been made in educational assessment. It is helpful for educators to get an understanding of how children think, how they process information, and how they remember knowledge since this enables the creation of more effective educational techniques. The discipline of psychological science makes a contribution to the administration of justice by assisting legal authorities in gaining a better understanding of the minds of criminals, evidence, and the limitations of specific forms of testimony or evidence. This contribution is made possible thanks to the fact that psychological science is one of the fields that makes up the field of psychological science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe scientific study of the human mind and behavior is known as psychology.

It assumes that you\u0027re new to the language, so it gets you started with basic functionality such as creating functions, creating variables, and calling these lines of code from your standard HTML pages. It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables.

Bootcamp with Hands-On Projects","shortDescription":"Learn to Build Responsive, Interactive Web Apps using Bootstrap and React.","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the Complete Bootstrap and React Bootcamp. This course teaches students how to create modern, interactive web pages using the Bootstrap framework and React JavaScript library. The course starts with an introduction into Bootstrap with a focus on its reputation in the development community as the number one choice for mobile-first front-end web frameworks. Bootstrap is a well documented collection of reusable code written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We start with exploring the foundations of Bootstrap, including embedding it into projects, and building out the basic Bootstrap page structure. From there we catapult into the infamous Bootstrap grid system, along with the commonly used three column web page layout. After the introductory topics, students learn to work with a number of components from typography, tables and image styling right up to wells, alerts, and buttons. As part of the course we demonstrate how to build out intricate navigation menus using dropdown, collapse, accordion, and pill menus. We will also cover form styling, carousels, modals, scrollspy and just about every other Bootstrap component that\u2019s instrumental to your journey as a front-end developer. The module concludes with a hands-on project, where students will use a Bootstrap theme to build a stunning web page from scratch.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn the second section of the course, we explore React. React, also known as React JS, is a powerful JavaScript library used for building custom, interactive user interfaces using UI components. Similar to Bootstrap, React is a well documented free and open source library. The project was founded by Meta and a network of independent developers. In this section, students learn how to use the React library through a series of hands-on projects. The React section of this course starts off with a hands-on project where you\u2019ll learn how to work with functional React components, props, Callback functions, OnClick Events, and the React State hook to build a fully functional calculator. From there we will dive into project number two, where you will build a connect-4 clone. Here we will cover more intermediate concepts including passing props, destructuring, passing arguments to click events, various styling methods, and handling callbacks. You will also learn about the React key property, React lifecycle events, and conditional rendering. By the end you will have built a complete multi and single player connect-4 game board with built-in AI capabilities. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn the final section of the course we further unleash the power of React by building out a complete e-commerce site with multiple product categories, a product showcase, shopping cart feature, and much more. Here, we introduce a number of integral new concepts including: JSON server, Fetch API, and installing React router. These essential building blocks will be used to render the product categories, style the product list, and configure the product details page. From there we dive into styled components, refactoring the shop layout, and exploring the concept of \u201Ccontext\u201D in React. In the final stages of the project students will configure the shopping cart basket, and the checkout feature. We will also implement a product search feature, followed by in-depth exercises on validating input forms in React.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAs you can see this course covers a tremendous bit of ground. Best of all it features Tim Maclachlan - a renowned senior full-stack developer with over 20 years of commercial development experience. As a multi-faceted developer, Tim specializes in algorithmic, analytical and mobile development. To date, he\u2019s written hundreds of applications and worked in a number of industries from commercial aviation and military, to banking and finance. Tim has a genuine passion for teaching others how to become better coders and looks forward to interacting with his students.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith that said, we hope you\u2019re just as excited about this course as we are, if so - hit that enroll button and let\u2019s get started.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-bootstrap-react-bootcamp-with-hands-on-projects/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4789952_48df.jpg","duration":"13 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"29,206.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Students interested in building mobile responsive websites using Bootstrap","Students interested in front-end web development","Students interested in learning React","Students interested in building UI components using React library"],"tags":["Bootstrap","React JS"],"rating":{"count":129,"averageValue":"4.6"},"instructors":[{"name":"YouAccel Training","url":"/user/youaccel/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.5283017}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"YOUACCEL62900","originalPrice":"\u20B91,999","discountedPrice":"\u20B9449","expirationText":"5 hours","discountPercentage":78}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/build-a-custom-e-commerce-site-in-react-javascript-basics/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4789922,"title":"Build a Custom E-Commerce Site in React \u002B JavaScript Basics","shortDescription":"Build a Fully Customized E-Commerce Site with Product Categories, Shopping Cart, and Checkout Page in React.","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EThis course takes you step-by-step through the process of building a fully functional calculator in React. React, also known as React JS, is a powerful JavaScript library used for building custom, interactive user interfaces using UI components. Some of the most well known examples of organizations using React for their front-end include Netflix, Facebook, and Airbnb. Developed and maintained by Meta along with a community of independent developers, React remains free and open-source. React is a component based library built entirely on JavaScript, which makes it perfect for designing complex UI\u2019s. With React, developers can build encapsulated components that efficiently manage their own state and render UI updates specifically when data changes. For example, think of the automated content refresh feature you see on a twitter feed, or facebook like button. Here the state of the UI component changes on the page, without having to manually refresh when the data is updated. This is just one small, yet powerful feature of React.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThrough a complete hands-on project, this course will teach you all the fundamental principles of React that you must know to become a proficient React developer. We start right from the basics, including the tools needed to get started. From there we dive into JSX, functional components, props, callbacks, and various OnClick events. By this stage, the calculator will have a complete visual display, coupled with functional arithmetic operations. Students then move on to passing parameters in Callback functions, using the React State Hook, and debugging.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn addition to the hands-on React module, we also offer a comprehensive overview of JavaScript for those who need a refresher. Here we start with introducing students to the document object model (DOM) which defines the logical structure of HTML documents. From there we dive into JavaScript to demonstrate various methods in which DOM elements can be manipulated to add interactivity to static components. We start right from the basics, which includes JavaScript placement, and data output. From there we move on to variable declaration, arithmetic operations, operator precedence, data types, and objects. Once the foundations are covered, we move on to more complex operations using Arrays, Conditional Statements, JavaScript comparison operators, booleans and loops. Here students will learn to unleash the true power of JavaScript to render different outcomes based on user interaction. We will explore the use of functions to efficiently handle repetitive tasks and JavaScript events to handle output based on actions and occurrences. The section will conclude with a hands-on project where students will implement their knowledge to build a web based photo gallery and background color changer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/build-a-custom-e-commerce-site-in-react-javascript-basics/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4789922_401f.jpg","duration":"7 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"25,019.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Students interested in learning the Foundations of JavaScript","Students interested in learning the Foundations of ReactJS Library","Students interested in Building Interactive UI Components using React","Students interested in learning how to build a fully customized E-Commerce Site in React"],"tags":["JavaScript","React JS"],"rating":{"count":85,"averageValue":"4.4"},"instructors":[{"name":"YouAccel Training","url":"/user/youaccel/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.464286}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"YOUACCEL62900","originalPrice":"\u20B91,999","discountedPrice":"\u20B9449","expirationText":"5 hours","discountPercentage":78}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-develop-winning-value-proposition-for-your-business/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4457452,"title":"Learn \u0026 Develop Winning Value Proposition for your business","shortDescription":"Best Practices from Johnson \u0026 Johnson \u0026 Dumex that helped them get more customers for existing and new products","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFacing challenges in getting more customers?
