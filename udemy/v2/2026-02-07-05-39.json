It assumes that you\u0027re new to the language, so it gets you started with basic functionality such as creating functions, creating variables, and calling these lines of code from your standard HTML pages. It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E*\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E javascript course contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript introduction\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript array\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript variables\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript functions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript objects\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript control statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript cookies\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript loop statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript data structures\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript error handling\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript regular expressions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003Esection 2- learn PHP\u0026nbsp;programming language\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis section will learn the basic structure of a web application and how a web browser interacts with a web server.

It offers powerful tools for data cleaning, transformation, and aggregation, making it essential for anyone working with data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u200B\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESeaborn for Data Visualization\u003C/strong\u003E: Seaborn is a high-level data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib. It simplifies the creation of attractive and informative statistical graphics, making data exploration and presentation more accessible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u200B\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPlotly Express for Interactive Visualizations\u003C/strong\u003E: Plotly is another Python library that excels in creating interactive and dynamic visualizations. It\u0027s especially useful for creating dashboards, however Plotly Express offers many unique plots that allow for special high-level analysis not found elsewhere, with the added benefit of interactivity Plotly Express can speed up the understanding of the patterns being seen and extract valuable insights faster than other plotting tools.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u200B\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EData Story Telling\u003C/strong\u003E: Turning your insights into a presentation is crucial as it allows you to effectively communicate complex data-driven findings to stakeholders, enabling data to drive informed decision-making. Presentation skills bridge the gap between data analysis and actionable outcomes, making your insights accessible and actionable in the business context.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u200B\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAI-Enhanced Learning\u003C/strong\u003E: Traditional education takes the stance that it is the student\u0027s responsibility, and not the education provider\u0027s, responsibility to ensure the knowledge covered in class is retained. At DataSimple we believe that our responsibility is to not only offer a robust set of information but also to help a student retain the knowledge. We have used Ai to enhance our educational material to ensure the students can easily retain the knowledge learned in class.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/python-data-analysis-bootcamp-pandas-seaborn-and-plotly/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5864046_ef60_10.jpg","duration":"14 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"15,863.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Beginner Python Developers interested in Data Science.","Those familiar with Excel and looking to build on this skillset.","Preparing for becoming machine learning scientist.","Looking to prepare for a return to university and take a data science program.","Switching into \u0022Data Science job market\u0022 and want to \u0022Start with Data Analysis\u0022.","Those who might need to use Hypothesis testing at work and want to talk intelligently their research."],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":105,"averageValue":"4.5"},"instructors":[{"name":"Brandyn Ewanek","url":"/user/brandyn-ewanek/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.64}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"D30F19CD07D08DCD6F92","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}}},"freeCourses":{}}
