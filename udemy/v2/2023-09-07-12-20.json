The process of writing the software itself involves the planning required for developing the product. The key principle of the RAD process is a reduction in planning to focus on a highly iterative design and construction process, enabling teams to accomplish more in less time, without impacting client satisfaction. Apart from a shorter time-to-market, one of the most significant advantages of RAD is client involvement. RAD emphasizes incremental and iterative delivery of functioning models to the client instead of following a rigid process model like the traditional SDLC. Depends on strong team and individual performances for identifying business requirements. Only system that can be modularized can be built using RAD. Requires highly skilled developers/designers. High dependency on modeling skills. Only suitable for scalable, component-based systems \u2013 RAD is best used for large systems with multiple components.

Do children today use their imaginations as much as we did when we were kids? Do you see your children spinning incredible tales and stories in their fantasy play as we used to when we played \u201Ccops and robbers\u201D or \u201Chouse\u201D? Or does your child\u2019s fantasy play seem to consist only of repetitive movements which have no story to them? I am sure you are aware of such a situation\u2026 Nowadays children are no longer as creative as they once were.\u0026nbsp; We live in an era obsessed with numbers, data, and test scores, especially as they apply to our kids and their education.\u0026nbsp; Seeing the decline in creativity should make us concerned about our children\u2019s capacities to innovate, problem-solve, and navigate new and unfamiliar situations. \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the world of child development, you may hear the phrases like \u201Ccritical thinking skills\u201D and \u201Ccreative problem-solving abilities\u201D when referring to goals for your child\u2019s cognitive development. What we are really talking about is\u2026 imagination. The way to create human beings with imagination is to provide them with opportunities to develop it for themselves when they are very young. These opportunities are found in one place and one place only\u2026 that is, play. Played with paints, playing with play dough, costumes, glue, and crayons. Making a mess. Exploring the woods. Splashing in a puddle. Wondering at a caterpillar you notice inching by you. Pretending to be a bird, gliding through the sky. All of these involve a great deal of imagination and development of their creative skills to many folds.\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, as parents, we must first learn the process of creative learning which we can offer to our kids. We parents should make ourselves aware of the different aspects of creative learning and critical thinking skills so that we can create an environment for our children to flourish in that environment.\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; In this course, we are going to discuss in detail the step-by-step process which you can walk your children through to make them creative learners and achievers.

This is a comprehensive project based course where you will learn step by step on how to perform complex analysis and visualisation on real estate market data. This course will be mainly concentrating on forecasting the future housing market using two different forecasting models, those are linear regression and LSTM which stands for long short term memory. Regarding programming language, we are going to use Python alongside several libraries like Pandas for performing data modelling, Numpy for performing complex calculations, Matplotlib for visualising the data, and Scikit-learn for implementing the linear regression model and various evaluation metrics. Whereas, for the data, we are going to download the real estate market dataset from Kaggle. In the introduction session, you will learn basic fundamentals of real estate market forecasting, such as getting to know the characteristics of the real estate market, forecasting models that will be used, and major problems in the real estate market nowadays like limited housing supply and population growth. Then, continue by learning the basic mathematics behind linear regression where you will be guided step by step on how to analyze case study and perform basic linear regression calculation. This session was designed to prepare your knowledge and understanding about linear regression before implementing this concept to your code. Afterward, you will learn several different factors that can potentially impact the real estate market, such as population growth, government policies, and infrastructure development. Once you\u2019ve learnt all necessary knowledge about the real estate market, we will start the forecasting project. Firstly, you will be guided step by step on how to set up Google Colab IDE, then, you will also learn how to find and download datasets from Kaggle. Once everything is all set, you will enter the main section of the course which is the project section. The project will consist of two main parts, the first one is forecasting the real estate market trend using linear regression while the second one is forecasting the real estate market trend using a long short term memory model. Lastly, at the end of the course, you will learn how to evaluate the accuracy and performance of your forecasting models using R-squared and directional symmetry methods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, before getting into the course, we need to ask ourselves these questions: why should we learn to forecast the real estate market? What\u2019s the benefit? Well, I have a ton of answers to those questions. Firstly, the real estate market has always been considered a strong investment option due to its potential for long-term appreciation and income generation. Property values tend to appreciate over time, offering the opportunity for capital gains, while rental income from properties can provide a steady cash flow. Meanwhile, as big data technology has advanced very rapidly in the past few years, integrating this technology to forecast future market trends and prices by identifying patterns in the historical data can be very beneficial as it allows investors to make a data driven investment decision. In addition, these skill sets that you learn are extremely valuable as they can be applied to different markets other than real estate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow are things that you can expect to learn from this course:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn basic fundamentals of real estate market forecasting, such as getting to know market characteristics and major problems faced by real estate market\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to perform linear regression calculations and gain an understanding of regression coefficients, intercepts, dependent variables, and independent variables\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn several factors that can potentially impact real estate market, such as population growth, job market, and infrastructure development\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to find and download datasets from Kaggle\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to upload data to Google Colab Studio\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to clean datasets by removing rows with missing values and duplicates\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to detect potential outliers in the dataset\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to analyze property price trend by calculating its annual mean and median\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to find correlation between property price and property type\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to analyze real estate market trend and find investment opportunities using sales ratio calculation\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to forecast real estate market trend using linear regression model\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to forecast real estate market trend using LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) model\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to evaluate the accuracy and performance of the forecasting models using R-squared analysis and directional symmetry analysis\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/forecasting-real-estate-market-with-linear-regression-lstm/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5538602_61c6.jpg","duration":"3.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"1,203.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["People who are interested in forecasting real estate market using linear regression and LSTM model","People who are interested in analysing and visualising complex dataset using Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy, Seaborn, and Scikit Learn","People who are interested in real estate investment"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":0,"averageValue":"0.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"Christ Raharja","url":"/user/christ-raharja/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":0}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"DCE78D62DA6E216EB900","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"3 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/smart-repricing-for-amazon-dropshipping/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5249240,"title":"Amazon Dropshipping And Retail Arbitrage With AI - 2023","shortDescription":"A step-by-step guide on how to start and grow your Amazon Dropshipping business using AI repricing software","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EWant to start and scale a profitable business on Amazon without having to deal with inventory management and high initial investment?

Then, in the second section, we will build up on the basics to learn ways to solve the linear program using the simplex method. We will then explore the concept of linear programming duality. We will also go through some of the hardest-to-understand concepts like strong duality, complementary slackness, and Farkas\u0027 lemma. Furthermore, we try to understand these concepts in an easy-to-follow way. This allows one to obtain lower bounds on the minimization problem and provide proof of optimality or Infeasibility. In the last section, we will explore how to perform sensitivity analysis (the effects of changing parts of a linear program).

We will start with a selection of definitions of what a problem is and the different facets a problem can have. We will then go into how IT management and the systemic approach are breaking new ground in finding solutions. Furthermore, we discuss why the word \u0022why\u0022 is essential and look at more examples from the traditional problem solving process. At the end there will be an exchange of experiences.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIT management related approach\u003C/strong\u003E: At the beginning we cover the problem solving process and which contents from the IT world are applicable. One competence we should definitely have in our fast-paced world is the ability to reduce complexity. In addition to a few examples, we will also go over the basics and importance. We will then move on to problem analysis and root cause analysis. For this we will get to know the 5x Why method with some examples. Likewise, we will cover an abstract example of root cause analysis. With the explicit definition of constraints we get approaches to solutions and thus come closer to a solution. The last chapter is about reframing problems and what we can derive valuable from it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECreative thinking in practice\u003C/strong\u003E: Almost overused is the term: \u0022creative thinking\u0022. In this example, we discuss the concept of serendipity and why serendipity is playing an increasingly important role in practice. In the rest of this chapter, we will go through two creativity techniques in detail and use examples to emphasize the power of implementation. From the perspective of thought processes, we will reflect on our own actions and take a hard look at our own implementation power from the previous chapters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESystemic approach to problem solving\u003C/strong\u003E: The systemic approach is very well suited especially for the problem solving process. In addition to a brief introduction, we explore the question of what a problem is from a systemic perspective. We go through an example of observing without interpreting, because this is an essential part of objective root cause analysis. Skills such as active listening and problem definition from a systemic perspective are also part of the basic repertoire of this course. In addition, it is about hypothesizing and constantly querying in the systemic loop to approach a problem solution. At the end of the lesson we will go through the restriction model, which once again should emphasize the creative methods on implementation strength.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESystemic questioning techniques with many examples:\u003C/strong\u003E Many of us are already familiar with some questioning techniques.
