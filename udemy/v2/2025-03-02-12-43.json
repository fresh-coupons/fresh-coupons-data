In unit testing, developers write test cases for small, self-contained units of code, such as functions, methods, or classes, to ensure that they behave as expected. These tests are designed to validate the correctness of the individual units and detect any defects or errors early in the development process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnit testing is typically performed by writing test cases that cover various scenarios and expected outcomes for each unit. These test cases are executed automatically and can be run frequently, providing rapid feedback on the behavior of the code. By isolating and testing units independently, developers can identify and fix issues quickly, preventing them from propagating to other parts of the system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main benefits of unit testing include increased code reliability, easier debugging, faster development cycles, and improved maintainability. It helps ensure that individual units function correctly and interact properly with other units. Unit testing also promotes modular design, as it encourages the separation of concerns and the creation of testable and reusable code.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall, unit testing plays a vital role in software development by providing a foundation for building robust, high-quality applications.

With unittest, developers can ensure the correctness and reliability of their code by systematically testing individual units or components.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eunittest follows the principles of test-driven development (TDD) and provides a structured approach to writing tests.

Scrum is advised to teams with experienced team members as the Framework requires great collaboration and self-organization as well.

There is no homework, which means that you can actually focus on soaking in the material. Feel free to stop, edit your own confluence and explore, without the pressure of an assignment behind it. I thought everything in the video was helpful and even learned a couple new tricks on how to structure my spaces. There are a variety of use-case scenarios that give you an idea of how to use this tool in different ways (which happens to be my favorite part). Useful demonstrations on layouts, permissions, status changes, drop down menus and more. Confluence is a Canvass that can be used as a great communication platform.
