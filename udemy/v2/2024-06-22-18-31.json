The goal of computer forensics is to perform a structured investigation and maintain a documented chain of evidence to find out exactly what happened on a computing device and who was responsible for it. Computer forensics -- which is sometimes referred to as computer forensic science essentially is data recovery with legal compliance guidelines to make the information admissible in legal proceedings. The terms digital forensics and cyber forensics are often used as synonyms for computer forensics. Digital forensics starts with the collection of information in a way that maintains its integrity. Investigators then analyze the data or system to determine if it was changed, how it was changed and who made the changes. The use of computer forensics isn\u0027t always tied to a crime. The forensic process is also used as part of data recovery processes to gather data from a crashed server, failed drive, reformatted operating system (OS) or other situation where a system has unexpectedly stopped working.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy is computer forensics important?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the civil and criminal justice system, computer forensics helps ensure the integrity of digital evidence presented in court cases. As computers and other data-collecting devices are used more frequently in every aspect of life, digital evidence and the forensic process used to collect, preserve and investigate it -- has become more important in solving crimes and other legal issues.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/computer-forensics-and-digital-forensics-for-everyone/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5023282_9752_5.jpg","duration":"16 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"55,238.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Anyone interested in learning about digital forensics and investigating cybercrimes.","Law enforcement professionals such as police officers, detectives, and investigators","Legal professionals such as lawyers, attorneys, and judges","IT professionals such as cybersecurity experts, network administrators, and system administrators","Forensic professionals such as forensic accountants and fraud examiners","Private investigators and consultants who specialize in digital forensics","The course covers a wide range of topics related to computer and digital forensics, including data recovery, evidence collection and analysis, and investigative techniques.

In this class, we will dive into the world of Data Structures and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using the popular programming language, C\u002B\u002B.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EData structures are an essential part of computer science, as they provide an organized way of storing and manipulating data. By using data structures, we can access and modify data more efficiently, which is essential for developing efficient and effective software.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn our class, we will cover various data structures, including arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and trees. We will explore how to implement these structures in C\u002B\u002B and how to perform basic operations like insertion, deletion, and searching. Additionally, we will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each data structure and when to use them in different situations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELinked lists, for example, are a popular data structure used to store and manage data in a sequence. Linked lists are efficient because they can be dynamically allocated and are flexible in size. However, they can be more complicated to implement and use than other data structures like arrays.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStacks and queues are also important data structures that are commonly used in software development. Stacks use the \u0022last in, first out\u0022 (LIFO) principle, while queues use the \u0022first in, first out\u0022 (FIFO) principle. These data structures are useful for managing data in a specific order, and we will learn how to implement and use them in our class.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrees are another popular data structure that we will cover in our class. Trees are useful for organizing data in a hierarchical structure and are often used in computer science applications like file systems, databases, and search engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to data structures, we will also cover the basics of OOP in C\u002B\u002B. Object-oriented programming focuses on encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. With OOP, we can create reusable code, improve code organization and structure, and make code maintenance more manageable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn our class, we will cover the basics of OOP in C\u002B\u002B, including classes, objects, constructors, and destructors. We will also discuss inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation, and how they can be used to improve the functionality of our programs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EC\u002B\u002B is a powerful programming language known for its speed and efficiency. It is widely used in developing operating systems, embedded systems, and gaming applications. With C\u002B\u002B, we can take advantage of its powerful features to create complex programs with high performance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn our class, we will explore the C\u002B\u002B syntax and how it can be used to implement data structures and OOP concepts.
