It assumes that you\u0027re new to the language, so it gets you started with basic functionality such as creating functions, creating variables, and calling these lines of code from your standard HTML pages. It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the

Menu items are explored and explained. Alternative routes to doing the same actions are also explained. Examples are worked through at a very good pace and the videos are not overwhelming. There is no homework, which means that you can actually focus on soaking in the material. Feel free to stop, edit your own confluence and explore, without the pressure of an assignment behind it. I thought everything in the video was helpful and even learned a couple new tricks on how to structure my spaces. There are a variety of use-case scenarios that give you an idea of how to use this tool in different ways (which happens to be my favorite part). Useful demonstrations on layouts, permissions, status changes, drop down menus and more. Confluence is a Canvass that can be used as a great communication platform.

To run a business at optimal capacity, you need to reduce or eliminate waste from processes and improve production flow. In this course, you\u0027ll learn about Lean strategies to reduce waste by determining which operations add value and which don\u0027t. You\u0027ll explore the concept of continuous flow, and discover how to balance work processes to make production flow more efficient.

And in any business, one of the heaviest drains on profitability is waste. Lean waste can come in the form of time, material, and labor. But it may also be related to the utilization of skill-sets as well as poor planning. In lean manufacturing, waste is any expense or effort that is expended but which does not transform raw materials into an item the customer is willing to pay for. By optimizing process steps and eliminating waste, the only true value is added at each phase of production.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday, the Lean Manufacturing model recognizes 8 types of waste within an operation; seven originally conceived when the Toyota Production System was first conceived, and an eighth added when the lean methodology was adopted within the Western World.

Build an E-Commerce Site, Calculator, and Connect4 Game.","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the Complete React Certification course. This course offers a comprehensive guide into one of the most powerful, modern JavaScript libraries available - ReactJS. Whether you are completely new to React, or you\u2019ve dabbled with it in the past, one thing\u2019s for sure - You\u2019ve likely interacted with a number of web applications that use the React library for building out user interface components. Some of the most well known examples include Netflix, Facebook, and Airbnb. Developed and maintained by Meta along with a community of independent developers, React remains free and open-source. React is a component based library built entirely on JavaScript, which makes it perfect for designing complex UI\u2019s. With React, developers can build encapsulated components that efficiently manage their own state and render UI updates specifically when data changes. For example, think of the automated content refresh feature you see on a twitter feed, or Facebook like button. Here, the state of the UI component changes on the page without having to manually refresh when the data is updated. This is just one small, yet powerful UI feature built into React.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThis course starts with exploring the foundations of React and its core use cases. We offer a concise definition of what React is and what it\u2019s not. From there, we explore the tools needed to get started along with an introduction into JSX, and Functional React components. Through a complete hands-on project you will learn a number of important concepts including react props, callbacks, OnClick Events and passing parameters within callback functions. By the end of module one you will have built a fully functional calculator, complete with display and numerical operators. We will also cover important topics such as the React State Hook, and Debugging.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn the second module students build out a multiplayer Connect-4 clone, with AI integration. Here we start with styling the individual game board components followed by advanced onClickEvents. This includes global, dynamic and inline styling. From there, we move on to passing props, destructing, and React children. Students will explore the React key property, along with Lifecycle events, game initialization, CSS variables, and conditional rendering. By the end, you will have built a complete Connect-4 game capable of automatically determining the winner in both a multi-player and AI based single player setting.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn module three we further unleash the power of React by building out a complete e-commerce site with multiple product categories, a product showcase, shopping cart feature, and much more. Here, we introduce a number of integral new concepts including: JSON server, Fetch API, and installing React router. These essential building blocks will be used to render the product categories, style the product list, and configure the product details page. From there we dive into styled components, refactoring the shop layout, and exploring the concept of \u201Ccontext\u201D in React. In the final stages of the project students will configure the shopping cart basket, and the integrated checkout feature. We will also implement a product search feature, followed by in-depth exercises on validating input forms in React.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAs you can see this course covers a tremendous bit of ground. Best of all it\u2019s authored by Tim Maclachlan - a renowned senior full-stack developer with over 20 years of commercial development experience. As a multi-faceted developer, Tim\u2019s core competencies include algorithmic, analytical and mobile development. To date, he\u2019s written hundreds of applications and worked in a number of industries from commercial aviation and military, to banking and finance. Tim has a genuine passion for teaching others how to become better coders and looks forward to interacting with his students.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWith that said, we hope you\u2019re just as excited about this course as we are, if so - hit the enroll button and let\u2019s get started.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/course/react-complete-developer-course-with-hands-on-projects/","imageUri":"https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4779652_766f_3.jpg","duration":"10.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"26,951.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Students interested in learning to Build Web Apps using React","Students interested in using JavaScript libraries for Building our Functional UI Components.","Students interested in interactive front-end development using React"],"tags":["React JS"],"rating":{"count":158,"averageValue":"4.3"},"instructors":[{"name":"YouAccel Training","url":"/user/youaccel/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.3076925}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"YOUACCEL76343","originalPrice":"\u20B92,299","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/course/accountingqabasics/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5313478,"title":"Accounting Q\u0026A (Basics)","shortDescription":"Your Ultimate Guide to Acing Accounting Exams and Interviews","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAcquire a deep and comprehensive understanding of fundamental accounting principles and practices that form the foundation of financial reporting and analysis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExplore practical insights into real-world accounting scenarios, allowing you to apply your knowledge to practical situations and make informed decisions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBenefit from expert answers to common accounting questions, providing you with valuable insights and guidance from experienced professionals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDevelop the skills and knowledge necessary to confidently tackle accounting exams, ensuring you are well-prepared and capable of achieving excellent results.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGain insights and strategies on how to excel in accounting interviews, including tips on presenting your skills, knowledge, and experience effectively.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDevelop the necessary skills and competencies to succeed in accounting careers, whether you are pursuing roles in public accounting, corporate finance, or financial management.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnhance your critical thinking and problem-solving abilities in the context of accounting, enabling you to analyze complex financial data and make informed decisions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn to interpret financial statements and reports with precision and accuracy, understanding their implications for business performance and financial health.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReceive comprehensive guidance on navigating the challenges of accounting exams and interviews, ensuring you are well-prepared and confident in your abilities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObtain the confidence, knowledge, and skills needed to excel in your accounting career, setting you on a path towards professional growth and success\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/course/accountingqabasics/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5313478_5264_7.jpg","duration":"2.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"422.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Beginners in Accounting","Entrepreneurs","Accounting Job Seekers","Accounting Professionals"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":1,"averageValue":"5.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"Imran Zakir","url":"/user/imran-zakir-2/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":5}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"LIMITEDOFFER","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/course/crea-tu-tienda-virtuale-commerce-sin-conocimientos-previos/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":1969048,"title":"Crea tu P\u00E1gina Web y Tienda Virtual sin saber Programar.","shortDescription":"Crea y administra tu P\u00E1gina web con cat\u00E1logo de productos para ofrecer tus servicios o vender tus productos en internet.","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u0026nbsp;

In this course you will learn to harness the power of JavaScript, XML, AJAX, and React to build highly interactive web pages from scratch. We start with an introduction into the document object model, followed by an in-depth guide to the essentials of JavaScript. In the JavaScript section you will learn a number of concepts instrumental towards your journey as a developer. This includes working with variables, arithmetic operators, objects, functions, arrays, events, and loops. You will also learn the importance of JavaScript placement, while working with both internal and external JavaScript code components. Students learn the importance of operator precedence when performing simple and complex arithmetic operations. Furthermore, you will have the opportunity to work with conditional statements to perform comparisons between different operations. Once you have a handle on the foundations, we\u2019ll dive into a number of JavaScript development projects where you will have an opportunity to apply your new skills with practical hands-on exercises. This includes building an automated background color changer, and photo gallery complete with mouse overs and image transitions.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn the second section of the course we will explore XML and AJAX to demonstrate the power of asynchronous page updates. This means building web components that automatically update on a web page, without having to manually refresh. You will have an opportunity to work with both XML and AJAX in conjunction with JavaScript to build modern web app components such as a search suggest feature, and a pre-populated select menu.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOnce you have a foundational understanding of JavaScript and AJAX, we will dive into working with React, a powerful JavaScript library used for front-end UI development. The React section starts off with a hands-on project where you\u2019ll learn how to work with functional React components, props, Callback functions, OnClick Events, and the React State hook to build a fully functional calculator. From there we will dive into project number two, where you will build a connect-4 clone. Here we will cover more intermediate concepts including passing props, de-structuring, passing arguments to click events, various styling methods, and handling callbacks. You will also learn about the React key property, React lifecycle events, and conditional rendering. By the end you will have built a complete multi and single player connect-4 game board with built-in AI capabilities. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn the final section of the course we further unleash the power of React by building out a complete e-commerce site with multiple product categories, a product showcase, shopping cart feature, and much more. Here, we introduce a number of integral new concepts including: JSON server, Fetch API, and installing React router. These essential building blocks will be used to render the product categories, style the product list, and configure the product details page.
