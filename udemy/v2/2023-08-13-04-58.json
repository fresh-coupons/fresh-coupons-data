This is a project based course where you will learn step by step on how to build a news channel and to create news videos with fully animated and super realistic AI powered news anchors. This course will give you a whole new perspective about how artificial intelligence is more than capable of revolutionising journalism. In addition, you will also be amazed by how far AI can automate news videos creation by speeding up the editing process as well as replacing human news anchors with a hyper realistic artificial intelligence powered news anchor as the substitution which can be very useful for independent journalist who want to keep their identity secret due to privacy or safety reasons. In the introduction session, you will learn several aspects where AI can be utilised to create news videos, such as converting news scripts to audio and producing animated news anchors to present the news. Then, you will continue by getting to know several news sources like Google News, AP News, and Reuters as well as learning how to check the potential bias and reliability of the news. This part is very crucial to make sure the news you are planning to cover are actually factual. Afterward, you will get to know several news topic ideas that you should consider and it is really recommended for you just to pick one and concentrate on that one topic. Once you have chosen your news topic, we will enter the main part of the course where you will be guided step by step on how to create and edit news video from scratch using AI tools like HeyGen, HourOne, and Paradiso AI. Those tools will enable you to convert text to audio as well as to integrate the audio with the fully animated news anchors. Once the video has been created and ready to be uploaded, we will go over comprehensive analysis on which social media platform that you should be uploading to. In that section, we will be mainly focusing on Youtube and Tiktok since those two platforms have the most audience and also the best options for video based contents. Last but not least, at the end of the course, you will learn several different ways to monetise your news channel and how to potentially turn this side hustle into a sustainable media business.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, before getting into the course, we need to ask this question to ourselves: why should we build a news channel? Well, if you were asking this question five or ten years ago, at that time, there had not been a lot of independent journalist yet and most of journalists work for media companies, nonetheless, the situation is totally different nowadays, as the rise of independent journalism in the past few years, more and more news channels are created on social media platforms like Youtube and Tiktok. Therefore, anybody can be an independent journalist nowadays and it is very possible to combine it with content creation. The advancement of artificial intelligence technologies in the past couple years also contributed very significantly where today you can even create news channels and upload videos where you are reporting news without showing your face since you can replace it with AI powered news anchors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow are things that you can expect to learn from the course:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to automate news videos creation process using AI\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to analyse and check if the news is unbiased, neutral, accurate, and factual\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to convert news articles from Google News, AP News, and Reuters into news scripts using ChatGPT\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to customise AI powered news anchors avatars\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to create a hyper realistic news videos with AI powered news anchor using HeyGen\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to create a hyper realistic news videos with AI powered news anchor using HourOne\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to create a hyper realistic news videos with AI powered news anchor using Paradiso AI\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to create breaking news intro using Canva\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to add subtitles automatically and edit news videos using Veed IO\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFull comprehensive analysis on which social media platform is the best to host your content videos: comparing Yotube vs Tiktok\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn several different strategies to monetise news videos and how to potentially turn this side hustle into a news channel business\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/automating-journalism-make-news-channel-with-ai-news-anchor/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5489852_b307.jpg","duration":"2.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"399.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Journalists who are interested to use AI to automate their news content creation process","People who are interested in starting a news channel or news agency"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":0,"averageValue":"0.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"Christ Raharja","url":"/user/christ-raharja/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":0}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"599C1794466BC765765E","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"3 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-pandas-for-absolute-beginners/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5097114,"title":"Complete Pandas for Absolute Beginners 2023","shortDescription":"Learn how to use the powerful Python pandas library to analyze and manipulate data.","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EThis course is designed for individuals with little or no experience with the Pandas library for Python. \u003Cstrong\u003EPandas\u003C/strong\u003E is a powerful and flexible \u003Cstrong\u003Eopen-source\u003C/strong\u003E data analysis and manipulation tool that is widely used in data science and data analysis.

This part starts with a concise conversation of such ideas as wrongdoing, criminal, degenerate, criminal science, law enforcement, and agreement and struggle viewpoints of criminology. The accompanying segment presents an overall rundown of the unique phases of the grown-up law enforcement system, as well as the adolescent equity. The first section of our Criminology and Criminal psychology training presents a general summary of the different stages of the criminal justice system, as well as the justice system. Next, this section illustrates how criminology informs policies and programs.

The term digital forensics was originally used as a synonym for \u003Cstrong\u003Ecomputer forensics\u003C/strong\u003E but has expanded to cover investigation of all devices capable of storing digital data. With roots in the personal computing revolution of the late 1970s and early 1980s, the discipline evolved in a haphazard manner during the 1990s, and it was not until the early 21st century that national policies emerged.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDigital forensics investigations have a variety of applications. The most common is to support or refute a hypothesis before criminal or civil courts. Criminal cases involve the alleged breaking of laws that are defined by legislation and that are enforced by the police and prosecuted by the state, such as theft and assault against the person. Civil cases on the other hand deal with protecting the rights and property of individuals (often associated with family disputes) but may also be concerned with contractual disputes between commercial entities where a form of digital forensics referred to as electronic discovery (discovery) may be involved\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring the 1980s very few specialized digital forensic tools existed, and consequently investigators often performed live analysis on media, examining computers from within the operating system using existing sysadmin tools to extract evidence. This practice carried the risk of modifying data on the disk, either inadvertently or otherwise, which led to claims of evidence tampering. A number of tools were created during the early 1990s to address the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDigital forensics is commonly used in both criminal law and private investigation. Traditionally it has been associated with criminal law, where evidence is collected to support or oppose a hypothesis before the courts. As with other areas of forensics this is often a part of a wider investigation spanning a number of disciplines. In some cases, the collected evidence is used as a form of intelligence gathering, used for other purposes than court proceedings (for example to locate, identify or halt other crimes). As a result, intelligence gathering is sometimes held to a less strict forensic standard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you enroll in our Digital Forensics Masterclass | Forensic Science 2023 DFMC, you\u0027ll not only learn about the fundamentals of digital forensics, but so much more!

Seven of the eight wastes are production process-oriented, while the eighth waste is directly related to management\u2019s ability to utilize personnel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWHAT YOU WILL LEARN to\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eclassify production activities as a value-add, non-value-add, or necessary non-value-add.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eidentify strategies for eliminating waste caused by overproduction and inventory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eidentify strategies for eliminating motion, waiting, and transportation waste.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eidentify elimination strategies for waste caused by overprocessing and defects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ematch cycle time and takt time to their descriptions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eidentify the final three steps for balancing a production line\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/the-concept-of-waste/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4584528_2810_3.jpg","duration":"1 total hour","enrolledStudentsCount":"10,889.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Any professional, who is seeking career growth in the quality management sector","Managers, Supervisors, Team Leaders, CEO, and Senior Managers, who want to encourage continuous improvement for an organisation and responsible for developing lean thinking, practical skills, measurement of production staff, and analysing the performance of the employee in the workplace.","Individuals involved in a continuous improvement project who needs a complete overview of the process"],"tags":["Waste Management"],"rating":{"count":61,"averageValue":"4.2"},"instructors":[{"name":"Islam arid","url":"/user/islam-arid/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.1829267}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"FEA8E73C40C365A06089","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/python-proficiency-exam-prep-4-practice-tests-2023/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5406484,"title":"Python Proficiency Exam Prep: 4 Practice Tests 2023","shortDescription":"Python Practice Tests: Assess Your Skills and Excel in Python Programming","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the Python Practice Tests course, where you will embark on a journey to master Python programming through comprehensive practice tests.

This will lead us to the revolution that deep learning brought to the game of computer vision, turning traditional filters into learnable parameters using Convolution Neural Networks. We will cover all the basics of ConvNets, including the details of the Vanilla architecture for image classification, hyper parameters like kernels, strides, maxpool and feature maps sizes calculations. Beyond the Vanilla architecture, we also cover the state-of-the art ConvNet meta-architectures and design patters, like skip-connnections, Inception, DenseNet...etc. In the second part, we will learn how to use ConvNets to solve practical problems in different situations, with small amount of data, how to use transfer learning and the different scenarios for that, and finally how to debug and visualize the leant kernels in ConvNets. In the last part, we will learn about different CV\u0026nbsp;apps using ConvNets. We will learn about the Encoder-Decoder design pattern. We start by the task of semantic segmentation, where we will build a U-Net architecture from scratch for the Cambridge Video (CAMVID) dataset. Then we will learn about Object Detection, covering both 2-stage and one-shot architectures like SSD and YOLO. Next, we will learn how to deal with the video data using the Spatio-Temporal ConvNet architectures.

There is a BIG difference in the way these two types of results are ranked. With organic search results, there are many more ranking factors that you will need to consider if you want to perform well in search. When it comes to paid results, advertisers are ranked according to the amount they\u2019ll pay a single visitor, sent to them through Google\u2019s Pay Per Click Ad\u2019s network. The more they are willing to pay the higher they will rank. It\u2019s as simple as that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrganic search doesn\u2019t work in the same way. You can\u2019t pay your way to the top. Instead, you need to optimise your site, pages, and content so you score highly in Google\u2019s ranking algorithm. The good news is, when people search for information on a topic, most people trust organic search results FAR more than they trust paid results.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this video, we\u2019ll be focusing solely on organic results, and giving you tips and advice you can use to perform well in organic Google search.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy do you need SEO?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch engines will be one of the main sources of traffic to your webpage and Google is the biggest and most popular search engine, by far.

In football \u2013 all coaches, on top of a basic game rules, players and skills, are studying different \u201Csystems\u201D how to play \u2013 for example: 4-4-2 (meaning with 4 players in defense, 4 players in the middle and 2 players as strikers), or 3-5-2, 4-5-1, or maybe 3-4-3 or something else within their game-plan. These \u201Csystems\u201D are just like our coaching frameworks called GROW, STEPPA, OSKAR, Wheel of Life and similar (covered in Section 1), and they (meaning frameworks) come as an addition to your own studying of a business in general and a human nature. And, just like in a football, a football-coach will choose his preferred system based on a results he is aiming to achieve, quality of his and his opponent\u2019s squad and similar \u2013a business coach will chose which Framework or a Model he is going to apply based on a:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- His own curriculum and targeted achievements;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- His Coachee\u2019s characteristics and needs;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- His own skills level and competences; and\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Context requirements;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand, football coach will develop a special schemes, actions or tricks (if you like) how his team is going to play when there is a \u201CFree kick\u201D, have to develop a fast counter-attack, to defend a \u201Ccorner-kick\u201D and similar. These \u201Cspecial situations\u201D are just like our \u201CPowerful Questions\u201D in a business coaching context \u2013 a ready-made special weapons that you are going to use occasionally, when you feel the moment is right.

At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E*\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E javascript course contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript introduction\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript array\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript variables\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript functions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript objects\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript control statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript cookies\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript loop statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript data structures\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript error handling\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript regular expressions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003Esection 2- learn PHP\u0026nbsp;programming language\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis section will learn the basic structure of a web application and how a web browser interacts with a web server.

Many systems and network administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what hosts are available on the network, what services (application name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems (and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It was designed to rapidly scan large networks but works fine against single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap suite includes an advanced GUI and results in the viewer (Zenmap), a flexible data transfer, redirection, and debugging tool (Ncat), a utility for comparing scan results (Ndiff), and a packet generation and response analysis tool (Nping).

Good one? I really hope so, but for sure I made all sorts of mistakes on my path of learning and practicing leadership.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are interested to explore more about this topic of transitioning from manager to leader, just watch few open videos and see if this resonates with you. We are going to help you with self-management secrets, how to navigate information, people and action realms, and help you to overcome the most common leadership fallacies. And, that\u2019s not the end \u2013 first and foremost, leadership is a daily practice of influencing people, mostly one person at a time \u2013 that\u2019s why we have created a lot of interesting tasks for you, a sort of a Leadership Work-Out Program \u2013 some interesting reads, video clips to watch, challenges to interact with your own people, perform some tests, and similar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*********************************************************************************************************************\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you would like to study a leadership \u2013 the most common approach is to explore a sort of a leadership process or behavior \u2013 meaning how to explore new possibilities, challenge the status quo, model the way, inspire a shared vision and mission, mobilize and unite people, and work on their individual motivation. And, we did it in our own way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimply, our intention is to go a bit deeper compared to this standard practice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u2019s why \u2013 this course is about studying the content all business leaders have to navigate \u2013 information realm, people, action realm and self-realm, within their own unit or company, and outside that terrain, as shown at the picture bellow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo better understand the necessity of this approach \u2013 we are going to open discussion with the most common \u003Cstrong\u003ELeadership fallacies\u003C/strong\u003E \u2013 that will stretch your thinking and hopefully, open new perspectives on the subject of business leadership. As we believe, that is the hearth of distinguishing a manager from a true business leader.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext, we are going deeper \u2013 to answer a challenge on how do you deal with your team\u2019s dynamics when you are not even there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt a surface,\u003Cstrong\u003E Information realm\u003C/strong\u003E is more focused on a simple, basic concepts like communication and control \u2013 here, leadership activities are instrumental in nature and based on using information to drive people to specific ends. We are going to talk about vision and mission, shaping culture and values and leading the change on a group level. And, most likely \u2013 it will open for you an ethical question \u2013 is this just a dealing with ideology and indoctrination, or an honest process of helping people to work together on pursuing the better future. We will share our own answer to this question for sure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext,\u003Cstrong\u003E People realm\u003C/strong\u003E is focused on leading the people inside your Unit and linking the unit to the outside world \u2013 the key is to understand that managing and leading is more than just giving instructions and controlling execution or results. Since it is mostly one-on-one or one-on-many activity, we are going to pay a lot of attention on motivating your people, helping them to grow, how to create a cohesive team and to study all aspects of power and influence. Of course, handling external affairs is extremely important topic as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAction realm\u003C/strong\u003E is focused on you doing different things inside your Unit, and dealing with outside pressures and opportunities. Yes, leading assumes doing through or alongside others (depending on your perspective), yet in order to stay informed, engaged and similar, you have to use (let\u2019s say) \u201Cyour hands\u201D as well and give an example.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd finally, within a \u003Cstrong\u003ESelf-realm\u003C/strong\u003E, we are going to focus on your own \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eperception\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E (meaning framing like conceiving strategies, setting goals and priorities, and scheduling meaning time distribution for yourself and others \u2013 as your inside work) and (on top of perception) \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ebehavior\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E (meaning actions like establishing context for everyone else, self-positioning, and similar \u2013 meaning dealing with your outside world). Most likely, studying the self is where all leadership starts. However \u2013 in order to help you see different perspectives first, we decided to close the discussion on leadership with this topic. As we believe \u2013 that\u2019s the best way to help you to find your own voice and shape your own leadership philosophy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd, as promised, we have created a lot of interesting tasks for you all over the course, a sort of a \u003Cstrong\u003ELeadership Work-Out Program\u003C/strong\u003E \u2013\u003Cstrong\u003E \u003C/strong\u003Esome interesting reads, video clips to watch, challenges to interact with your people, perform some easy tests, and similar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really hope you are going to enjoy it.

We will demonstrate how Deep Learning has re-shaped this area of Artificial Intelligence using concepts like word vectors and embeddings, strucutured deep learning, collaborative filtering, recurrent neural networks, sequence-to-sequence models and transformer networks. In our journey, we will be mostly concerned with how to represent the language tokens, being at the word or character level, and and how to represent their aggregation, like sentences or documents, in a semantically sound way. We start the journey by going through the traditional pipeline of text pre-processing and the different text features like binary and TF-IDF\u0026nbsp;features with the Bag-of-Words model. Then we will dive into the concepts of word vectors and embeddings as a general deep learning concept, with detailed discussion of famous word embedding techniques like word2vec, GloVe, Fasttext and ELMo. This will enable us to divert into recommender systems, using collaborative filtering and twin-tower model as an example of the generic usage of embeddings beyond word representations. In the second part of the course, we will be concerned with sentence and sequence representations. We will tackle the core NLP of Langauge Modeling, at statistical and neural levels, using recurrent models, like LSTM\u0026nbsp;and GRU. In the following part, we tackle sequence-to-sequence models, with the flagship NLP\u0026nbsp;task of Machine Translation, which paves the way to talk about many other tasks under the same design seq2seq pattern, like Question-Answering and Chatbots.

This generalization leads to the to the state-of-the art Transformer Network, which revolutionized the world of NLP, using full attention mechanisms.

We describe here the famous OpenAI Gym environments, which will be our playground when it comes to practical implementation of the algorithms that we learn about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2- In the second part we discuss the main formulation of an RL problem as a Markov Decision Process or MDP, with simple solution to the most basic problems using Dynamic Programming.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3- After being armed with an understanding of MDP, we move on to explore the solution space of the MDP problem, and what the different solutions beyond DP, which includes model-based and model-free solutions. We will focus in this part on model-free solutions, and defer model-based solutions to the last part. In this part, we describe the Monte-Carlo and Temporal-Difference sampling based methods, including the famous and important Q-learning algorithm, and SARSA. We will describe the practical usage and implementation of Q-learning and SARSA on control tabular maze problems from OpenAI Gym environments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4- To move beyond simple tabular problems, we will need to learn about function approximation in RL, which leads to the mainstream RL methods today using Deep Learning, or Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). We will describe here the breakthrough algorithm of DeepMind that solved the Atari games and AlphaGO, which is Deep Q-Networks or DQN. We also discuss how we can solve Atari games problems using DQN in practice using Keras-RL and TF-Agents.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5- In the fifth part, we move to Advanced DRL algorithms, mainly under a family called Policy based methods. We discuss here Policy Gradients, DDPG, Actor-Critic, A2C, A3C, TRPO and PPO methods. We also discuss the important Stable Baseline library to implement all those algorithms on different environments in OpenAI Gym, like Atari and others.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6- Finally, we explore the model-based family of RL methods, and importantly, differentiating model-based RL from planning, and exploring the whole spectrum of RL methods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully, you enjoy this course, and find it useful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/reinforcement-learning-english/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5312986_d313.jpg","duration":"9 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"2,733.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Machine Learning Researchers","Machine Learning Engineers","Data Scientists"],"tags":["Reinforcement Learning"],"rating":{"count":4,"averageValue":"4.9"},"instructors":[{"name":"Coursat.ai Dr. Ahmad ElSallab","url":"/user/coursatai/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.75}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"F651428DAFB6C0C1FC81","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"\u20B9449","expirationText":"5 hours","discountPercentage":44}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/practical-machine-learning-for-data-scientists/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4644516,"title":"Practical Machine Learning for Data Scientists","shortDescription":"Practical AI and ML","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EThis course is a comprehensive introduction to AI and Machine Learning, targeting Data Scientists and Machine Learning engineers.

If you want to build a mobile application that targets both Android and iOS and also create a backend for your application, you are in the right place. This course is all about bringing two big frameworks altogether \u2013 Flutter and Spring Boot. Throughout this course, we will build a mobile application that is backed by Spring Boot. Using Flutter, we will build our UI and we will use Spring Boot to build REST APIs that will be consumed by our Flutter app.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlutter and Spring Boot are two big players in the industry. Flutter took no time to become one of the most popular Mobile Apps development framework for its simplicity, easy to learn and multiplatform features while Spring Boot is a proven horse in the long race. Getting skilled according to market demand is every developer\u2019s dream and to become a skilled person in any field takes considerable amount of time. To build a successful production level project, you may have to join many pieces together and go through a series of observations and considerations. Selecting the most suitable platform for your project is a big thing because there\u2019re many eligible candidates out there in the market. Almost every mobile apps require a backend to persist, store it\u2019s data and microservices. Learning different framework is time consuming, learning curve may differ significantly. Wouldn\u2019t that be wonderful if you are introduced with the two most demanding framwork from scratch in a single course? That\u2019s why you are here and this course is just for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlutter and Spring Boot are two big frameworks, getting skilled in each environment requires time. Combining these two in a single course was a bit challenging. Besides, putting more features from both the framework in the course could increase it\u2019s length and could be a burden. For this reason, I have put minimum but most basic features from both the framework and tried to build an app by leveraging the power of both of them. By taking this course, you will have a better and strong understanding in both Flutter and Spring Boot. Besides, Dart and Java have many similarities between them. This will give you an advantage to learn both the languages in parallel. I hope you will get the best out of this course, you will learn how to build Flutter apps from scratch and also how to make a RESTFul service with Spring Boot. You will start as a beginner, and at the end of the course, you will be confident enough to go beyond your capabilities by yourself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe will build one single project throughout this course, and that will be a Bus Ticket Booking or Seat Reservation app where app users will search for different routes on a specific day he/she wants to travel, select the suitable schedule, select one or more seats and then submit the reservation. We will have an Admin for our app whose responsibility is to add bus, routes and schedules. We will provide authentication functionalities for our Admin, we will talk about how we can secure our data or end points and authorization, that means, what kind of data our users can access or not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough I will start from scratch, assuming you have no prior knowledge in Flutter and Spring Boot, I strongly recommend you to have a little basic knowledge of Dart and Java programming language to get a smoother experience from this course. If you don\u2019t have any experience in Dart and Java, I suggest you to follow any YouTube channel to learn the basics of Dart and Java before you get to start this course. I have been always careful to keep the length of this course as short as possible. It is observed that long courses fails to keep their audiences till the end. You probably have bought other courses but never been able to reach the end.
