Once stimulated by a vaccine, the antibody-producing cells, called B cells (or B lymphocytes), remain sensitized and ready to respond to the agent should it ever gain entry to the body. A vaccine may also confer passive immunity by providing antibodies or lymphocytes already made by an animal or human donor. Vaccines are usually administered by injection (parenteral administration), but some are given orally or even nasally (in the case of flu vaccine). Vaccines applied to mucosal surfaces, such as those lining the gut or nasal passages, seem to stimulate a greater antibody response and may be the most effective route of administration. (For further information, \u003Cem\u003Esee\u003C/em\u003E immunization.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe first vaccines\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdward Jenner: smallpox vaccination\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first vaccine was introduced by British physician Edward Jenner, who in 1796 used the cowpox virus (vaccinia) to confer protection against smallpox, a related virus, in humans. Prior to that use, however, the principle of vaccination was applied by Asian physicians who gave children dried crusts from the lesions of people suffering from smallpox to protect against the disease. While some developed immunity, others developed the disease. Jenner\u2019s contribution was to use a substance similar to, but safer than, smallpox to confer immunity. He thus exploited the relatively rare situation in which immunity to one virus confers protection against another viral disease. In 1881 French microbiologist Louis Pasteur demonstrated immunization against anthrax by injecting sheep with a preparation containing attenuated forms of the bacillus that causes the disease. Four years later he developed a protective suspension against rabies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVaccine effectiveness\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehistorical mass vaccination programs in the United States\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter Pasteur\u2019s time, a widespread and intensive search for new vaccines was conducted, and vaccines against both bacteria and viruses were produced, as well as vaccines against venoms and other toxins. Through vaccination, smallpox was eradicated worldwide by 1980, and polio cases declined by 99 percent. Other examples of diseases for which vaccines have been developed include mumps, measles, typhoid fever, cholera, plague, tuberculosis, tularemia, pneumococcal infection, tetanus, influenza, yellow fever, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, some types of encephalitis, and typhus\u2014although some of those vaccines are less than 100 percent effective or are used only in populations at high risk. Vaccines against viruses provide especially important immune protection, since, unlike bacterial infections, viral infections do not respond to antibiotics\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVaccine types\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow the polio vaccine changed the world\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe challenge in vaccine development consists in devising a vaccine strong enough to ward off infection without making the individual seriously ill. To that end, researchers have devised different types of vaccines. Weakened, or attenuated, vaccines consist of microorganisms that have lost the ability to cause serious illness but retain the ability to stimulate immunity. They may produce a mild or subclinical form of the disease. Attenuated vaccines include those for measles, mumps, polio (the Sabin vaccine), rubella, and tuberculosis. Inactivated vaccines are those that contain organisms that have been killed or inactivated with heat or chemicals. Inactivated vaccines elicit an immune response, but the response often is less complete than with attenuated vaccines. Because inactivated vaccines are not as effective at fighting infection as those made from attenuated microorganisms, greater quantities of inactivated vaccines are administered. Vaccines against rabies, polio (the Salk vaccine), some forms of influenza, and cholera are made from inactivated microorganisms. Another type of vaccine is a subunit vaccine, which is made from proteins found on the surface of infectious agents. Vaccines for influenza and hepatitis B are of that type. When toxins, the metabolic by-products of infectious organisms, are inactivated to form toxoids, they can be used to stimulate immunity against tetanus, diphtheria, and whooping cough (pertussis).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how vaccines enhance the human immune system to fight against harmful pathogens\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ehistory\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ein the late 20th century, advances in laboratory techniques allowed approaches to vaccine development to be refined. Medical researchers could identify the genes of a pathogen (disease-causing microorganism) that encode the protein or proteins that stimulate the immune response to that organism. That allowed the immunity-stimulating proteins (called antigens) to be mass-produced and used in vaccines. It also made it possible to alter pathogens genetically and produce weakened strains of viruses. In that way, harmful proteins from pathogens can be deleted or modified, thus providing a safer and more-effective method by which to manufacture attenuated vaccines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVaccinology is \u003Cstrong\u003Ethe science and engineering of developing vaccines to prevent infectious diseases\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EVaccines contain antigens that stimulate the immune system to produce an immune response that is often similar to that produced by the natural infection\u003C/strong\u003E.

Some sources suggest these practices were taking place as early as 200 BCE.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ein 1721, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu brought smallpox inoculation to Europe, by asking that her two daughters be inoculated against smallpox as she had observed practice in Turkey.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn 1774, Benjamin Jesty makes a breakthrough.

Genetic material that codes for a desired antigen is inserted into the attenuated form of a large virus, such as the vaccinia virus, which carries the foreign genes \u201Cpiggyback.\u201D The altered virus is injected into an individual to stimulate antibody production to the foreign proteins and thus confer immunity. The approach potentially enables the vaccinia virus to function as a live vaccine against several diseases, once it has received genes derived from the relevant disease-causing microorganisms. A similar procedure can be followed using a modified bacterium, such as \u003Cem\u003ESalmonella typhimurium\u003C/em\u003E, as the carrier of a foreign gene.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGardasil human papillomavirus vaccine\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVaccines against human papillomavirus (HPV) are made from virus like particles (VLPs), which are prepared via recombinant technology. The vaccines do not contain live HPV biological or genetic material and therefore are incapable of causing infection. Two types of HPV vaccines have been developed, including a bivalent HPV vaccine, made using VLPs of HPV types 16 and 18, and a tetravalent vaccine, made with VLPs of HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother approach, called naked DNA therapy, involves injecting DNA that encodes a foreign protein into muscle cells. The cells produce the foreign antigen, which stimulates an immune response.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVaccines based on RNA have been of particular interest as a means of preventing diseases such as influenza, cytomegalovirus infection, and rabies. Messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines are advantageous because the way in which they are made allows them to be developed more quickly than vaccines made via other methods. In addition, their production can be standardized, enabling rapid scale-up for the manufacture of large quantities of vaccine. Novel mRNA vaccines are safe and effective; they do not contain live virus, nor does the RNA interact with human DNA.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eadvantage and dis advantage\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBenefits of vaccination\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFind out from Dr. Tina Tan of Northwestern University why adult vaccination against various types of diseases is important\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee all videos for this article\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to the development of memory B cells, which are capable of triggering a secondary immune response upon exposure to the pathogen targeted by a vaccine, vaccination is also beneficial at the population level. When a sufficient number of individuals in a population are immune to a disease, as would occur if a large proportion of a population were vaccinated, herd immunity is achieved. That means that if there is random mixing of individuals within the population, then the pathogen cannot be spread throughout the population. Herd immunity acts by breaking the transmission of infection or by lessening the chances of susceptible individuals coming in contact with a person who is infectious. Herd immunity provides a measure of protection to individuals who are not personally immune to the disease\u2014for instance, individuals who, because of their age or underlying medical conditions, cannot receive vaccines or individuals who received vaccines but remain susceptible. Herd immunity played an important role in the successful eradication of smallpox, and it is vital in preventing the spread of diseases such as polio and measles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdverse reactions\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVaccination carries some risk of reaction, though adverse effects typically are very rare and very mild. The most common reactions to vaccines include redness and soreness around the vaccination site. More severe adverse reactions, such as vomiting, high fever, seizure, brain damage, or death, are possible for some vaccines. Such reactions are exceptionally rare, however\u2014occurring in less than one in a million people for most vaccines. Severe reactions also tend to affect only certain populations, such as persons whose immune systems are compromised by preexisting disease (e.g., HIV/AIDS) or who are undergoing chemotherapy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClaims have been made that vaccines are responsible for certain adverse health conditions, particularly autism, speech disorders, and inflammatory bowel disease. Some of those claims focused on thimerosal, a mercury-containing compound used as a preservative in vaccines. Some people believed that autism was a form of mercury poisoning, caused specifically by thimerosal in childhood vaccines. Those claims have been discredited. Still, misinformation and fear generated by false claims about associations between autism and vaccines had a significant impact on individuals\u2019 perceptions about vaccine safety. In addition, most individuals in countries where vaccination is widespread have never personally experienced vaccine-preventable disease. Thus, the focus of concern for some people shifted from the negative effects of vaccine-preventable disease to the possible negative effects of the vaccines themselves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComplacency about vaccine-preventable diseases, combined with concerns over the effects of vaccination, led to decreasing levels of vaccination coverage in some areas of the world. As a consequence, not only were individuals susceptible to vaccine-preventable diseases, but, at population levels, vaccination rates dropped low enough to cause losses of herd immunity, thereby allowing outbreaks of disease. Such outbreaks brought high costs to societies, especially in terms of health and medical care, disability and economic strain, and loss of life. In the 20th century in Japan, England, and Russia, for example, numbers of children vaccinated against whooping cough dropped sufficiently low so as to enable outbreaks of disease that involved thousands of children and resulted in hundreds of deaths\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/all-about-vaccine-and-vaccnation/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5182800_89bd_2.jpg","duration":"1.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"4,350.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Medical students and  all professionals concern with vaccination"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":28,"averageValue":"3.8"},"instructors":[{"name":"Mohamed AL ashram","url":"/user/mohamed-taha-288/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.285714}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"1923F0188F6705FCE301","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"3 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/hands-on-python-data-science-data-science-bootcamp/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":6186047,"title":"Hands On Python Data Science - Data Science Bootcamp","shortDescription":"Master Python for Data Science with Real-World Applications: Dive Deep into Data Analysis, Machine Learning","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EThis comprehensive course is designed for both beginners and those looking to sharpen their data science skills.

Those individuals, who had already contracted the disease, recovered and became \u201Cimmune.\u201D Variolation was practiced for many years in China. The process involved exposing healthy people to the material derived from the lesions caused by the disease by either putting it under the skin or, more often, inserting powdered scabs from smallpox pustules into the nose. However, that occasionally resulted in death because there was no standardization of the inoculum. Variolation, later, became popular \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ein England, mainly due to the efforts of Lady Mary Wortley Montague and the American colonies. In 1796, Jenner inoculated James Phipps with the material obtained from a cowpox lesion, which appeared on the hand of a \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edairymaid, and he inoculated the experimental subject with smallpox about six weeks later, without producing disease [1]. In 1875, Robert Koch was able to show the presence of anthrax causing bacteria in the lymph nodes of a dead rabbit that was earlier inoculated with the blood of a diseased animal [2]. In a serendipitous discovery, Pasteur was able to attenuate the virulent chicken cholera bacillus and coined the term vaccination. Later, he developed first viable vaccine for anthrax and rabies while Robert Koch studied hypersensitivity in tuberculosis. Although many consider Louis Pasteur the \u201Cfather of \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eimmunology,\u201D it is due to his and Koch\u2019s efforts that firmly established the historical germ theory of disease. Then, various scientists contributed to the development of the concept of cellular and humoral immunity. While working on the development of digestive organ in starfish larvae, Metchnikoff became a leading proponent of the \u201CCellularists.\u201D He believed that phagocytes, not antibodies, played the leading role in immunity. Emil von Behring and Kitasato demonstrated the transfer of immunity against Diphtheria by a soluble \u201Canti-toxin\u201D in the blood\u0026nbsp; whereby, Paul Ehrlich predicted the existence of immune bodies (antibodies) and side-chains from which they arise (receptors). Ehrlich suggested that antigens interact with receptors borne by cells, resulting in the secretion of excess receptors (antibodies).the supporters of alternative theory, i.e., \u201CHumoralists,\u201D believed that a soluble substance in the body was responsible for mediating immunity \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E OVERVIEW OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPHYSICAL BARRIERS\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eimmunological mechanisms\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETHE INNATE IMMUNE SYSTEM\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETHE ADAPTIVE IMMUNE SYSTEM\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eorgan of immune system\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecells of immune system\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAntigen\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMacrophage\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhat is immune response ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eimmunoglobulin\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eimmunotolerance\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehistocompatibility\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eimmunotherapy\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecytokines\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecomplement system\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegulation of immune response\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eimmunity to infection\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etransplantation immunology\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eautoimmune diseases\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehypersensitivity \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eimmunization\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etumor immunology\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eimmunodiagnostics\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/immunology-step-by-step/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5080764_72e0_3.jpg","duration":"6 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"8,812.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Students who are considering or attending medical school or other health-related professional programs (nursing, pharmacy, PA) \u2013 including those at the high school, undergraduate, and postgraduate levels Professionals looking to improve knowledge for work on health care applications, projects, and research Curious learners with sufficient prerequisites (biology, chemistry, physics) who want to know more"],"tags":["Immunology"],"rating":{"count":57,"averageValue":"4.1"},"instructors":[{"name":"Mohamed AL ashram","url":"/user/mohamed-taha-288/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.19}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"A35B5A86A5CD94453DEC","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"21 hours","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-certificate-in-customer-experience-management/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":6362575,"title":"Advanced Certificate in Customer Experience Management","shortDescription":"CX, Customer Experience Management, Segmentation, CX Marketing, CJM, Service Blueprint and Process Design, Data Analysis","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWelcome to Program: Advanced Certificate in Customer Experience Management by MTF Institute\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECourse provided by \u003Cstrong\u003EMTF Institute of Management, Technology and Finance\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMTF\u003C/strong\u003E is the global educational and research institute with HQ at Lisbon, Portugal, focused on business \u0026amp; professional hybrid (on-campus and online) education at areas: Business \u0026amp; Administration, Science \u0026amp; Technology, Banking \u0026amp; Finance. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMTF R\u0026amp;D \u003C/strong\u003Ecenter focused on research activities at areas: Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Data Science, Big Data, WEB3, Blockchain, Cryptocurrency \u0026amp; Digital Assets, Metaverses, Digital Transformation, Fintech, Electronic Commerce, Internet of Things. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMTF\u003C/strong\u003E is the official partner of: IBM, Intel, Microsoft, member of the Portuguese Chamber of Commerce and Industry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMTF \u003C/strong\u003Eis present in 215 countries and has been chosen by more than 678 000 students.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECourse Author:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EDr. Alex Amoroso\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E is a seasoned professional with a rich background in academia and industry, specializing in research methodologies, strategy formulation, and product development.

Because their stomach linings contain a mix of lactic acid, bacteria as milk contaminants and rennet, the milk would ferment and coagulate. A product reminiscent of yogurt would have been produced, which through gentle agitation and the separation of curds from whey would have resulted in the production of cheese; the cheese being essentially a concentration of the major milk protein, casein, and milk fat. The whey proteins, other major milk proteins, and lactose are all removed in the cheese whey.

The cheesemakers placed the cheese curds inside of the mold, secured the mold with a lid, then added pressure to separate the whey, which would drain out from the holes in the mold. The more whey that was drained, the less moisture retained in the cheese. Less moisture meant that the cheese would be firmer. In Ireland, some cheeses ranged from a dry and hard cheese (mullahawn) to a semi-liquid cheese (mills\u00E9n)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe designs and patterns were often used to decorate the cheeses and differentiate between them. Since many monastic establishments and abbeys owned their share of milk animals at the time, it was commonplace for the cheeses they produced to bear a cross in the middle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough the common perception of cheese today is made from cow\u0027s milk, goat\u0027s milk was actually the preferred base of ancient cheesemakers, due to the fact that goats are smaller animals than cows. This meant that goats required less food and were easier to transport and herd. Moreover, goats can breed any time of the year as opposed to sheep, who also produce milk, but mating season only came around during fall and winter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore the age of pasteurization, cheesemakers knew that certain cheeses could cause constipation or kidney stones, so they advised their customers to supplement these side effects by eating in moderation along with other foods and consuming walnuts, almonds, or horseradish\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe process\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe goal of cheese making is to control the spoiling of milk into cheese. The milk is traditionally from a cow, goat, sheep, or buffalo, although, in theory, cheese could be made from the milk of any mammal. Cow\u0027s milk is most commonly used worldwide. The cheesemaker\u0027s goal is a consistent product with specific characteristics (appearance, aroma, taste, texture). The process used to make a Camembert will be similar to, but not quite the same as, that used to make Cheddar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome cheeses may be deliberately left to ferment from naturally airborne spores and bacteria; this approach generally leads to a less consistent product but one that is valuable in a niche market.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECulturing\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheese is made by bringing milk (possibly pasteurized) in the cheese vat to a temperature required to promote the growth of the bacteria that feed on lactose and thus ferment the lactose into lactic acid. These bacteria in the milk may be wild, as is the case with unpasteurized milk, added from a culture, frozen or freeze dried concentrate of starter bacteria. Bacteria which produce only lactic acid during fermentation are homofermentative; those that also produce lactic acid and other compounds such as carbon dioxide, alcohol, aldehydes and ketones are heterofermentative. Fermentation using homofermentative bacteria is important in the production of cheeses such as Cheddar, where a clean, acid flavor is required. For cheeses such as Emmental the use of heterofermentative bacteria is necessary to produce the compounds that give characteristic fruity flavors and, importantly, the gas that results in the formation of bubbles in the cheese (\u0027eye holes\u0027).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStarter cultures are chosen to give a cheese its specific characteristics. In the case of mold-ripened cheese such as Stilton, Roquefort or Camembert, mold spores (fungal spores) may be added to the milk in the cheese vat or can be added later to the cheese curd.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECoagulation\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring the fermentation process, once sufficient lactic acid has been developed, rennet is added to cause the casein to precipitate. Rennet contains the enzyme chymosin which converts \u03BA-casein to para-\u03BA-caseinate (the main component of cheese curd, which is a salt of one fragment of the casein) and glycomacropeptide, which is lost in the cheese whey. As the curd is formed, milk fat is trapped in a casein matrix. After adding the rennet, the cheese milk is left to form curds over a period of time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFresh chevre hanging in cheesecloth to drain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDraining\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce the cheese curd is judged to be ready, the cheese whey must be released. As with many foods the presence of water and the bacteria in it encourages decomposition. To prevent such decomposition it is necessary to remove most of the water (whey) from the cheese milk, and hence cheese curd, to make a partial dehydration of the curd. There are several ways to separate the curd from the whey.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaturing cheese in a cheese cellar\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScalding\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn making Cheddar (or many other hard cheeses) the curd is cut into small cubes and the temperature is raised to approximately 39 \u00B0C (102 \u00B0F) to \u0027scald\u0027 the curd particles. Syneresis occurs and cheese whey is expressed from the particles. The Cheddar curds and whey are often transferred from the cheese vat to a cooling table which contains screens that allow the whey to drain, but which trap the curd. The curd is cut using long, blunt knives and \u0027blocked\u0027 (stacked, cut and turned) by the cheesemaker to promote the release of cheese whey in a process known as \u0027cheddaring\u0027. During this process the acidity of the curd increases to a desired level. The curd is then milled into ribbon shaped pieces and salt is mixed into it to arrest acid development. The salted green cheese curd is put into cheese moulds lined with cheesecloths and pressed overnight to allow the curd particles to bind together. The pressed blocks of cheese are then removed from the cheese moulds and are either bound with muslin-like cloth, or waxed or vacuum packed in plastic bags to be stored for maturation. Vacuum packing removes oxygen and prevents mold (fungal) growth during maturation, which depending on the wanted final product may be a desirable characteristic or not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMold-ripening\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EMain article: Cheese ripening\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn contrast to cheddaring, making cheeses like Camembert requires a gentler treatment of the curd. It is carefully transferred to cheese hoops and the whey is allowed to drain from the curd by gravity, generally overnight. The cheese curds are then removed from the hoops to be brined by immersion in a saturated salt solution. The salt absorption stops bacteria growing, as with Cheddar. If white mold spores have not been added to the cheese milk it is applied to the cheese either by spraying the cheese with a suspension of mold spores in water or by immersing the cheese in a bath containing spores of, e.g., \u003Cem\u003EPenicillium candida\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy taking the cheese through a series of maturation stages where temperature and relative humidity are carefully controlled, allowing the surface mold to grow and the mold-ripening of the cheese by fungi to occur. Mold-ripened cheeses ripen very quickly compared to hard cheeses (weeks against months or years). This is because the fungi used are biochemically very active when compared with starter bacteria. Some cheeses are surface-ripened by molds, such as Camembert and Brie, some are ripened internally, such as Stilton, which is pierced with stainless steel wires, to admit air to promote mould spore germination and growth, as with \u003Cem\u003EPenicillium Roquefort\u003C/em\u003E. Surface ripening of some cheeses, such as Saint-Nectaire, may also be influenced by yeasts which contribute flavor and coat texture. Others are allowed to develop bacterial surface growths which give characteristic color\u0027s and appearances, e.g., by the growth of \u003Cem\u003EBrevibacterium linens\u003C/em\u003E which gives an orange coat to cheeses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/from-milk-to-magic-the-transformative-power-of-cheesemaking/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5108450_90ac_5.jpg","duration":"2 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"3,492.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["All  interested in cheese making processs"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":14,"averageValue":"3.6"},"instructors":[{"name":"Mohamed AL ashram","url":"/user/mohamed-taha-288/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":3.8214285}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"0FC784DDC0080171E4BA","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"21 hours","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/genetic-from-mendal-to-era-of-microchip-molecular-genetic/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5365326,"title":"Biotechnology today and yesterday","shortDescription":"Biotechnology applications","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMolecular genetics\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMolecular genetics is a subfield of genetics that focuses on the structure and function of genes on a molecular level, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eincluding genetic variation, gene expression, and DNA replication and repair.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis field aims to understand how genes are transmitted from one generation to the next and how they \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Einfluence human behavior, health, and disease.

Epithelium, connective tissue, muscle tissue, and nervous tissue have commonalities but look very distinct structurally after staining. Each stain exists to highlight an important feature or component within a tissue type. For example, one of the most common stains, Hematoxylin, is a basic dye that stains proteins a blue color, while Eosin stains proteins a pink color. These two stains are commonly used together to define intracellular organelles and proteins. Because of the variety of the proteins that exist, some stains were created to highlight a particular protein, which this review will discuss in the following sections. The benefit of using a special stain is that it can highlight the specific protein very well. However, because of its specificity, the other structures will not be seen. For this reason, multiple slides will often be created from a given specimen so that multiple stains can be performed to gather the full range of needed information.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlmost all tissue stains are performed on tissue that has been removed from the body. However, in rare instances, very specialize stains called vital stains can work on tissue remaining in the body. These stains are used for the identification of specific types of tissue and identification of abnormal tissue, so a subsequent biopsy can be more accurate in obtaining abnormal tissue\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETissue Preparation\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore specific staining can occur, tissue samples must undergo preparation through the following stages: Fixation, processing, embedding, sectioning, and sometimes antigen retrieval. In modern histology laboratories, most of these steps are automated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E.\u003Cstrong\u003EFixation: \u003C/strong\u003EFixation uses chemicals to preserve the structure of the tissue in its natural form and protects it from degradation by irreversibly cross-linking proteins. Although several specialized fixatives are available, Neutral Buffered Formalin is a common choice for this step. The fixation step is vital to the rest of the histologic staining procedure because by retaining the chemical composition of the tissue, the sample is hardened and makes the sectioning phase easier. Paraffin-formalin is another effective fixative. Its benefit is that it is the fixative of choice for immunostaining; however, it requires preparation at the time of the fixation. Bouin is a fixative used for examining embryo and brain tissue because of its superior preservation of delicate nuclei and glycogen. Its downside is that it does not preserve kidney tissues well and also distorts mitochondrial structure.[1]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDehydration: \u003C/strong\u003EThe addition of ethanol accomplishes the dehydration of a sample. It removed water from the sample and further hardens the tissue for eventual light microscopy. After ethanol is applied, and following the completion of tissue dehydration, xylene is used to remove the ethanol.[1]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEmbedding: \u003C/strong\u003EEmbedding is the process of putting the sample into a paraffin wax or a plastic resin to enhance the process of extracting cellular structures. This step is to be performed with caution if the goal is to perform immunostaining because the paraffin wax will inhibit the penetration of antibodies, and lead to a false result.[1]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESectioning: \u003C/strong\u003ESectioning involves mounting the specimen on a microtome and cutting it into sections. The preferred thickness is 4-5 micrometers so that it can be stained and put on a microscope slide for examination.[1]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAntigen Retrieval: \u003C/strong\u003EThis step is to retrieve antigens that could have been covered in the fixation and embedding stages. If the cross-linking of proteins conceals the antigen sites, there may not be as robust of an immunohistochemical response. Antigen retrieval is achieved through heating and proteolytic methods to break down the cross-links and reveal the epitopes and antigens that were previously covered.[1] Although this step carries the risk of denaturing both the fixative and the antigens themselves, a successful antigen retrieval method can lead to a much more effective immunostaining intensity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/histology-step-by-step/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5080670_193b.jpg","duration":"1.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"4,107.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Medical students, science students ,nursing students ,medical protectional"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":9,"averageValue":"4.5"},"instructors":[{"name":"Mohamed AL ashram","url":"/user/mohamed-taha-288/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.5555553}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"0F1B72EFF06BDBB24E28","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"21 hours","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/medical-genetics-n/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5080804,"title":"medical genetics learn abnormal human variations","shortDescription":"cares for individuals and families with abnormal variation the story of genetics and its applications","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMedical genetics\u003C/strong\u003E is the branch of medicine that involves the diagnosis and management of hereditary disorders.

In the case of a computer server farm, cooling capacity is one of the, if not most important criteria. Computer servers will generate heat whilst operating, most of the time operating 24 hours a day. Cooling capacity must be sufficient to stop the servers from over heating and therefore turning off which could lead to a huge loss of data.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHeating Capacity\u003C/strong\u003E - Whilst not as important as cooling capacity in our case, still required in extreme temperatures such as Anchorage, Alaska where average high temperatures in January are around 23\u00BAF. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHumidity Control\u003C/strong\u003E - In a computer farm where there are many electrical systems, humidity control is important to ensure the servers function properly.
