Microsoft Access has an interface that looks like other Microsoft Office products but there are so many other tools in MS Access that you can\u0027t see in other Microsoft Office applications as it is specially designed for a unique purpose. Microsoft Access is extensively used in data handling or creating the database. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMicrosoft Access is used for different kinds of data handling work.

In any company, Microsoft Access can be used to create \u0026amp; manage the data record of employees. Or in any business, you can use Microsoft Access to create \u0026amp; manage the database sheet for your employees, inventory, goods, or products. Other than these you can use Microsoft Access for any kind of data handling work.
