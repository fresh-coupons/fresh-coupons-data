In either case, congratulations on selecting one of the most fast-paced segments of the automotive industry. Working with the electrical systems can be challenging, yet very rewarding; however, it can also be very frustrating at times. For many people, learning electrical systems can be a struggle. It is my hope that I am able to present the course to you in such a manner that you will not only understand electrical systems, but will excel at it. There are many ways the theory of electricity can be explained, and many metaphors can be used. Some compare electricity to a water flow, while others explain it in a purely scientific fashion. Everyone learns differently. I am presenting electrical theory in a manner that I hope will be clear and concise. If you do not fully comprehend a concept, then it is important to discuss it with your instructor.

They would specialize in engines, steering/ suspension, or brakes. Today, there is not a system on the vehicle that is immune to the role of electrical circuits. Engine controls, electronic suspension systems, and anti-lock brakes are common on today\u2019s vehicles. Even electrical systems that were once thought of as being simple have evolved to computer controls. Headlights are now pulse-width modulated using high side drivers and will automatically brighten and dim based on the light intensity of oncoming traffic. Today\u2019s vehicles are equipped with twenty or more computers, laser-guided cruise control, sonar park assist, infrared climate control, fiber optics, and radio frequency transponders and decoders. Simple systems have become more computers reliant. For example, the horn circuit on the 2008 Chrysler 300C involves three separate control modules to function. Even the tires have computers involved, with the addition of tire pressure monitoring systems!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday\u2019s technician must possess a full and complete electrical background to be able to succeed.

Whenever they dismantle something, they can reassemble it how it was. Whenever they say that they need to investigate the hood, they can really get the darn thing open. Furthermore, when they need to change a level, they don\u0027t endure ten minutes attempting to sort out which end of the raise is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFortunately, you don\u0027t need to be brought into the world with a wrench in your grasp to know how to fix things \u2014 even things as apparently convoluted as a vehicle.

To get a better idea of the possible demand for used cars in your area, you\u2019ll need to crunch some numbers. By knowing the number of used cars sold in your area every year and month , you can estimate what percentage of the market you will be likely to be able to corner and reach. By locating the average profit per vehicle, you can get an approximate idea of how much profit and money your dealership able to make per year. While the groundwork associated with opening a dealership can be time-consuming, expensive, and demanding, the real test of your dealership\u2019s viability doesn\u2019t begin until after you open your doors to the public.

We will also cover in our udemy course Network Scalability, I will explain how, as more demands are placed on a server,\u0026nbsp; systems need to scale to address these demands. Several threading techniques supporting this need are demonstrated, including thread pools, futures, and the \u003Cstrong\u003ENIO\u0027\u003C/strong\u003Es selector. We will also cover in our udemy course Network Security, you\u2019ll learn how applications need to protect against a variety of threats.

The accompanying segment presents an overall rundown of the unique phases of the grown-up law enforcement system, as well as the adolescent equity. The first section of our Criminology and Criminal psychology training presents a general summary of the different stages of the criminal justice system, as well as the justice system. Next, this section illustrates how criminology informs policies and programs. Unfortunately, there are instances when policies are not founded\u003Cbr\u003Eon criminological theory and rigorous research, but are more of an interesting reaction to perceived problems.

Digital cameras\u003Cstrong\u003E \u003C/strong\u003Eare built into doorbells; your smartphone tracks your daily movements from work to home and back; and you receive social media updates when you go to the gym, see a show, or visit a new city.

There is almost no criminal activity that does not involve digital evidence, and it is your responsibility as an investigator to gather all available evidence, process it, and present your findings to the authorities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInvestigators who work in the field of digital forensics must have a diverse set of skills and interests. The first question I ask anyone thinking about a career in this field is if they enjoy solving puzzles. You may not have access to any information other than the fact that something happened when investigating a case. So, if someone needs to be shown or told what happened, this field may not be right for them. When a case is brought to an investigator\u0027s attention, the investigator is often given instructions to figure out what the computer or device was used for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother important trait is the ability to deal with frustration, as investigative tools and software do not always work without problems. When it comes to cell phones and small devices, this is a fairly common occurrence. Many students, rather than working through the challenges, stop their investigation in class at the first sign of difficulty. They don\u0027t even try to figure out what\u0027s wrong with the tool by looking at the web or using the help system. To be a successful investigator, one must be persistent and creative \u2013 they must be problem solvers. Digital forensics is a branch of forensic science that collects, analyses, documents, and presents digital evidence related to computer crime for use in a court of law using scientific knowledge. Knowing what was done, when it was done, and who did it is the ultimate goal. The term \u201Cdigital forensics\u201D is often used interchangeably with \u201Ccomputer forensics\u201D (also known as \u201Ccyber forensics\u201D), but it has come to encompass all devices capable of storing digital data, including networking devices, mobile phones, tablets, digital cameras, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, digital home appliances, and other digital storage media such as CD/DVD, USB drives, SD cards, external drives, and backup tapes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComputer Forensics is a specialization that deals with the recovery, examination and investigation of digital evidence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComputer Forensics is an applied science that deals with the recovery, examination and investigation of digital evidence.

Kotlin has classes with constructors, along with nested, inner, and anonymous inner classes, and it has interfaces like Java 8. Kotlin does \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E have a new keyword. To create a class instance, call the constructor just like a regular function. We saw that in the screenshot above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKotlin has single inheritance from a named superclass, and all Kotlin classes have a default superclass Any, which is \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E the same as the Java base class java.lang.Object. Any contains only three predefined member functions: equals(), hashCode(), and toString().\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKotlin classes have to be marked with the open keyword in order to allow other classes to inherit from them; Java classes are kind of the opposite, as they are inheritable \u003Cem\u003Eunless\u003C/em\u003E marked with the final keyword. To override a superclass method, the method itself must be marked open, and the subclass method must be marked override. This is all of a piece with Kotlin\u2019s philosophy of making things explicit rather than relying on defaults. In this particular case, I can see where Kotlin\u2019s way of explicitly marking base class members as open for inheritance and derived class members as overrides avoids several kinds of common Java errors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, you\u0027ll learn how to create apps and run them on virtual devices through guided exercises. You\u0027ll cover the fundamentals of Android development, from structuring an app to building out the UI with Activities and Fragments and various navigation patterns. Progressing through the chapters and lectures, you\u0027ll delve into Android\u0027s RecyclerView to make the most of displaying lists of data and become comfortable with fetching data from a web service and handling images. You\u0027ll then learn about mapping, location services, and the permissions model before working with notifications and how to persist data. Moving on, you\u0027ll get to grips with testing, covering the full spectrum of the test pyramid. You\u0027ll also learn how AAC (Android Architecture Components) are used to cleanly structure your code and explore various architecture patterns and the benefits of dependency injection. \u003Cem\u003EThe core libraries of RxJava and Coroutines are covered for asynchronous programming\u003C/em\u003E.

But, quite quickly, through a variety of handset offers that struck a chord with practical, price-conscious consumers, as well as those who are fashion-conscious and tech-savvy, Android user numbers exploded. For many, myself included, developing for Android is the most rewarding pastime and business, bar none. Quickly putting together a prototype of an idea, refining it, and then deciding to run with it and wire it up into a fully-fledged app, is such an exciting and rewarding process. Any programming can be fun \u2013 I have been programming all my life \u2013 but creating for Android is somehow extraordinarily rewarding..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKotlin is the most succinct language, and therefore is the least error-prone, \u003Cem\u003Ewhich is great for beginners\u003C/em\u003E.

The term digital forensics was originally used as a synonym for \u003Cstrong\u003Ecomputer forensics\u003C/strong\u003E but has expanded to cover investigation of all devices capable of storing digital data. With roots in the personal computing revolution of the late 1970s and early 1980s, the discipline evolved in a haphazard manner during the 1990s, and it was not until the early 21st century that national policies emerged.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDigital forensics investigations have a variety of applications. The most common is to support or refute a hypothesis before criminal or civil courts. Criminal cases involve the alleged breaking of laws that are defined by legislation and that are enforced by the police and prosecuted by the state, such as theft and assault against the person. Civil cases on the other hand deal with protecting the rights and property of individuals (often associated with family disputes) but may also be concerned with contractual disputes between commercial entities where a form of digital forensics referred to as electronic discovery (discovery) may be involved\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring the 1980s very few specialized digital forensic tools existed, and consequently investigators often performed live analysis on media, examining computers from within the operating system using existing sysadmin tools to extract evidence. This practice carried the risk of modifying data on the disk, either inadvertently or otherwise, which led to claims of evidence tampering. A number of tools were created during the early 1990s to address the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDigital forensics is commonly used in both criminal law and private investigation. Traditionally it has been associated with criminal law, where evidence is collected to support or oppose a hypothesis before the courts. As with other areas of forensics this is often a part of a wider investigation spanning a number of disciplines. In some cases, the collected evidence is used as a form of intelligence gathering, used for other purposes than court proceedings (for example to locate, identify or halt other crimes). As a result, intelligence gathering is sometimes held to a less strict forensic standard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you enroll in our Digital Forensics Masterclass | Forensic Science 2023 DFMC, you\u0027ll not only learn about the fundamentals of digital forensics, but so much more!

The goal of computer forensics is to perform a structured investigation and maintain a documented chain of evidence to find out exactly what happened on a computing device and who was responsible for it. Computer forensics -- which is sometimes referred to as computer forensic science essentially is data recovery with legal compliance guidelines to make the information admissible in legal proceedings. The terms digital forensics and cyber forensics are often used as synonyms for computer forensics. Digital forensics starts with the collection of information in a way that maintains its integrity. Investigators then analyze the data or system to determine if it was changed, how it was changed and who made the changes. The use of computer forensics isn\u0027t always tied to a crime. The forensic process is also used as part of data recovery processes to gather data from a crashed server, failed drive, reformatted operating system (OS) or other situation where a system has unexpectedly stopped working.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy is computer forensics important?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the civil and criminal justice system, computer forensics helps ensure the integrity of digital evidence presented in court cases. As computers and other data-collecting devices are used more frequently in every aspect of life, digital evidence and the forensic process used to collect, preserve and investigate it -- has become more important in solving crimes and other legal issues.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/computer-forensics-and-digital-forensics-for-everyone/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5023282_9752_5.jpg","duration":"16 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"32,836.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Anyone interested in learning about digital forensics and investigating cybercrimes.","Law enforcement professionals such as police officers, detectives, and investigators","Legal professionals such as lawyers, attorneys, and judges","IT professionals such as cybersecurity experts, network administrators, and system administrators","Forensic professionals such as forensic accountants and fraud examiners","Private investigators and consultants who specialize in digital forensics","The course covers a wide range of topics related to computer and digital forensics, including data recovery, evidence collection and analysis, and investigative techniques.

It assumes that you\u0027re new to the language, so it gets you started with basic functionality such as creating functions, creating variables, and calling these lines of code from your standard HTML pages. It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the
