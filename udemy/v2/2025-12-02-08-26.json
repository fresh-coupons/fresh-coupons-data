It is intended for experienced professionals and serious mid-career practitioners who want to move beyond basic compliance and manage hazardous materials in a structured, defensible, and professionally credible way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn today\u2019s regulatory and stakeholder environment, hazardous materials management is closely tied to legal exposure, operational continuity, financial performance, and organizational reputation. Regulators, customers, and communities expect organizations to demonstrate effective control over the storage, handling, transport, use, and disposal of hazardous substances. This course is designed to help professionals meet those expectations by focusing on the technical, regulatory, and risk-management capabilities required to protect people, property, and the environment while supporting operational objectives.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECompletion of the program indicates that participants understand hazardous materials management as a lifecycle responsibility, from planning and classification through routine operations, transport and waste disposition, incident response, remediation, and long-term stewardship.

Regulatory frameworks and technical principles are linked to typical organizational challenges such as inspection and audit readiness, permit and license conditions, contractor oversight, and coordination between EHS, operations, maintenance, and leadership. Participants are encouraged to analyze their own workplace context and identify realistic improvements in governance, procedures, documentation, and controls.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnvironmental stewardship and sustainable decision-making form an important part of the program. The course highlights how sound hazardous materials management can reduce waste, prevent incidents, lower lifecycle costs, and support broader environmental and social commitments. Participants are guided on integrating environmental management systems (EMS) and occupational health and safety management systems (OHSMS) with daily operations, and on reinforcing a safety culture that combines technical controls, clear management systems, and competent personnel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor individual professionals, the course offers a structured route to formalize existing experience, strengthen professional credibility, and prepare for roles with wider responsibilities in hazardous materials and EHS management.

Once you complete this course, you will have all the necessary knowledge to do the structural design of a building. You can do the structural design of buildings on your own projects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe spent years at college but yet there are some topics that are overlooked in the engineering syllabus but are important in working fields. This course titled \u0022 ETABS: Structural Analysis and Design of a Building\u0022 has been created in order to fill that void and help students start out with structural design software. ETABS is a structural analysis and design software developed by csiamerica. It is a very powerful software that can design almost any kind of civil engineering structure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EETABS is used for the design of beam and columns only. However, this course also contains the design of slab and the footing. \u003C/strong\u003EUnlike other courses available online which only teach you tools of ETABS and not the actual process of analysis and design, this course takes a real-world architectural drawing of a building so as to explain the entire process from modeling up to the design.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/etabs-from-zero-to-hero/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5419432_c578_2.jpg","duration":"5.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"23,962.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Civil engineering students","Civil engineering graduates"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":261,"averageValue":"4.3"},"instructors":[{"name":"Ashish Pandit","url":"/user/ashish-pandit-56/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.24}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"6319AD731392910CDFA0","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}}},"freeCourses":{}}
