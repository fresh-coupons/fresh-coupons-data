It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E*\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E javascript course contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript introduction\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript array\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript variables\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript functions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript objects\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript control statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript cookies\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript loop statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript data structures\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript error handling\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript regular expressions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003Esection 3- learn PHP\u0026nbsp;programming language\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this section, we will learn the basic structure of a web application, and how a web browser interacts with a web server.

When an object is serialized, the fields marked as \u003Cstrong\u003Etransient\u003C/strong\u003E are not included in the serialized state of the object. This is crucial when dealing with sensitive data or when a field\u0027s value can be recreated and does not need to be persisted. Therefore, the correct answer is C) To exclude a variable from the serialization process. Understanding the use of \u003Cstrong\u003Etransient\u003C/strong\u003E is important for effective memory management and security in Java applications, especially when dealing with object serialization and deserialization processes.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EQuestion:\u003C/strong\u003E In Java, which of the following is true about a \u003Cstrong\u003Efinal\u003C/strong\u003E method?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA) It cannot be overridden in a subclass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB) It cannot be overloaded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EC) It cannot be invoked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ED) It must return a value.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EExplanation:\u003C/strong\u003E A \u003Cstrong\u003Efinal\u003C/strong\u003E method in Java signifies that the method cannot be overridden by any subclasses. This is used to prevent alteration of behavior by subclasses, ensuring the method\u0027s functionality remains consistent across the hierarchy. It doesn\u0027t restrict the method from being overloaded (which is determined by the method\u0027s signature), nor does it affect its ability to return a value or to be invoked. Thus, the correct answer is A) It cannot be overridden in a subclass. This concept is fundamental in Java for ensuring the integrity of methods in inheritance hierarchies, particularly when designing classes that provide specific functionalities that must not be altered.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EQuestion:\u003C/strong\u003E What is the result of attempting to compile and run a Java program with a \u003Cstrong\u003Emain\u003C/strong\u003E method declared as \u003Cstrong\u003Eprivate\u003C/strong\u003E?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA) Compilation error\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB) Runtime error\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EC) Runs successfully\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ED) None of the above\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EExplanation:\u003C/strong\u003E In Java, the \u003Cstrong\u003Emain\u003C/strong\u003E method can be declared as \u003Cstrong\u003Eprivate\u003C/strong\u003E, and the program will still compile without any errors. However, when attempting to run such a program, it will not produce a runtime error; rather, the JVM will start execution as usual. This is because access modifiers like \u003Cstrong\u003Eprivate\u003C/strong\u003E, \u003Cstrong\u003Epublic\u003C/strong\u003E, or \u003Cstrong\u003Eprotected\u003C/strong\u003E do not affect the execution of the \u003Cstrong\u003Emain\u003C/strong\u003E method by the JVM. The correct answer is C) Runs successfully. This question is essential in understanding the nuances of access modifiers in Java and their impact on the execution of the Java application, particularly the special status of the \u003Cstrong\u003Emain\u003C/strong\u003E method in Java applications.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EQuestion:\u003C/strong\u003E What does the \u003Cstrong\u003Estatic\u003C/strong\u003E keyword signify when applied to a method in Java?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA) The method belongs to an instance of a class.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB) The method can be called without an instance of the class.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EC) The method is thread-safe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ED) The method can only be called by static methods in the same class.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EExplanation:\u003C/strong\u003E A \u003Cstrong\u003Estatic\u003C/strong\u003E method in Java means that the method belongs to the class, rather than instances of the class. This implies that the method can be called without creating an instance of the class. It does not inherently guarantee thread safety nor does it limit its accessibility only to other static methods. Therefore, the correct answer is B) The method can be called without an instance of the class. Understanding the concept of static methods is crucial in Java, as it helps in creating utility methods and accessing shared resources without needing to instantiate the class every time.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EQuestion:\u003C/strong\u003E In the context of Java Exception handling, what is the difference between \u003Cstrong\u003Ethrow\u003C/strong\u003E and \u003Cstrong\u003Ethrows\u003C/strong\u003E?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA) \u003Cstrong\u003Ethrow\u003C/strong\u003E is used to declare an exception, and \u003Cstrong\u003Ethrows\u003C/strong\u003E is used to explicitly throw an exception.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB) \u003Cstrong\u003Ethrow\u003C/strong\u003E is used to explicitly throw an exception, and \u003Cstrong\u003Ethrows\u003C/strong\u003E is used to declare an exception.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EC) There is no difference, both keywords have the same functionality.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ED) \u003Cstrong\u003Ethrow\u003C/strong\u003E is used in try-catch blocks, while \u003Cstrong\u003Ethrows\u003C/strong\u003E is used outside try-catch blocks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EExplanation:\u003C/strong\u003E In Java, \u003Cstrong\u003Ethrow\u003C/strong\u003E and \u003Cstrong\u003Ethrows\u003C/strong\u003E are two different mechanisms related to exceptions. The \u003Cstrong\u003Ethrow\u003C/strong\u003E keyword is used to explicitly throw an exception, allowing a method to generate a specific exception and pass it up the call stack. On the other hand, \u003Cstrong\u003Ethrows\u003C/strong\u003E is used in a method signature to declare that a method might throw certain exceptions, which need to be either caught or declared to be thrown in the method calling this method. Therefore, the correct answer is B) \u003Cstrong\u003Ethrow\u003C/strong\u003E is used to explicitly throw an exception, and \u003Cstrong\u003Ethrows\u003C/strong\u003E is used to declare an exception.
