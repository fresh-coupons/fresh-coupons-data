economics concerned with the use and \u0022application of economic principles\u0022 in the analysis of engineering decisions. As a discipline, it is focused on the branch of economics known as microeconomics in that it studies the behavior of individuals and firms in making decisions regarding the allocation of limited resources. Thus, it focuses on the decision-making process, its context and the environment\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a discipline though, it is closely related to others such as statistics, mathematics, and cost accounting.
