This library is a powerful object-oriented interface to the Tk GUI toolkit. In this course, you would get to know more about organizing and fitting widgets into the layout, basic transformations, creation of drop-down menu, shapes \u0026amp; graphics, intricacies of building login applications, and many other advanced GUI techniques. This will take you through different types of GUI interfaces and help in a detailed explanation of building a button in a GUI. we would create a windows application wherein we would first learn to set up the mainframe and then build on to that for creating a guest list page and a check-in page. Finally creating page having guest by room numbers and their receipts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPython GUI is one of the various toolkits present with Python and this toolkit focusses on developing GUI (Graphical User Interface). Now since python GUI is very specific to Python, let us look at what GUI essentially means, and then we may be able to jump into understanding specifically Python GUI. GUI or in other words, Graphical User Interface is a form of a connection tool through which users would be able to interact with electronic devices. This interaction is through the use of buttons and graphical icons which makes it visually appealing for users to use and the software behind the icons removes the robotic coding required to perform the particular task. The intention of the introduction of GUI is thought to reduce the commands that need to be typed at the command-line interface (CLI) through keyboard and that exactly what task it does!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow coming to Python GUI, let us say, for example, we would need to run a code in python, a .py file through the command line. We would create a simple GUI which might have a button \u201CRun\u201D and once a user clicks on that the python file which intends to run will automatically get selected and will run. What Python GUI would do essentially is remove the unnecessary coding part of running the python file through CLI. Not only this there are other plausible features Python GUI provides and that\u2019s exactly what you would go through in this course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring the training and post completion of the training, one would imbibe skills to take on more daring challenges in professional life. This course will also allow you to grasp the business intelligence required to be that handful of developers in Python GUI. This training will also give you a glimpse of the security concerns one faces in the real-world and, also allow you to think about how we can take care of those concerns. This Python GUI Course will also help you in getting the frame of mind to design the visual components and understand the temporal behavior of building the GUI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you complete the course you would b able to appreciate the enhancement of efficiency through the use of GUI, and the ease of use of the logical design of the program underlying in the design. With the completion of the course you would be able to bring in modularity in any GUI application you would build along with enhancing the usability perspective of GUI. This training is not restricted to just the theoretical part, but we enhance the use of theoretical concepts in the playground of real-life projects giving you an upper hand in establishing the relation of the concept and using them in real life. We ensure that no stone will be left unturned to make you the best python GUI developer organizations are looking for. Just choose a unit test framework that your organization would demand, a test runner, an IDE and we assure that you would be good to go in leaping in the professional world.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/python-gui-training-program-for-gui-development/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4719338_de52.jpg","duration":"3 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"12,310.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["The courses we conduct online never restricts the audience we expect to reach to.

The two most important routing protocols which will be explained in detail are the RIP also known as Routing information protocol and the other is EIGRP which is the abbreviated form for Extended interior Gateway protocol. In the RIP protocol, the oldest of the vectors for distance IP Routing protocols are still put to use and thereby getting various enhancements. There are currently two versions that exist for the RIP viz. RIPv1 and RIPv2. RIPv1 is also said to be the classful protocol which means that it is not classless whereas if you talk about the RIPv2, it is considered to be the classless support routing protocol and IPv6 is the one whose support is extended to RIPv2 with the next-gen RIP which is also termed as RIPng. EIGRP, on the other hand, is related to the Interior Gateway protocol as it is a proprietary protocol of the company CISCO. This protocol is occasionally described as the distance vector routing protocol which also acts and imitates like a link state-oriented protocol. Distance vector-based protocols share everything of which they are aware of. The only limitation they carry is that the amount of information shared is only among the neighbors which are directly or indirectly connected with each other. Link state-based protocols announce that the information present is only about the direction and not indirectly connected links. However, they are also responsible to share the routing protocol information among themselves in all the areas they deem fit among all the routes in their domain or area.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/cisco-ospf-hands-on-certification-training/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4844382_3644_3.jpg","duration":"10.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"14,775.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["The target audience for this course is anybody who has a keen interest in the field of digital communication and is also aware of how the basics of understanding the networks and other routing protocols and mechanisms such as OSPF Routing.

It is platform-independent and easily portable. Java can be used to develop web applications, standalone GUI applications and complex large-scale distributed applications to enable the resolution of complex solutions more easily. Java is an object-oriented Programming Language and functional features have been added in the recently released Java versions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJava was developed and is being maintained by Oracle Corporation. It is a general-purpose programming language which has concurrent and multi-threading programming features. Java is safe, static and strongly typed programming language. Java has a special runtime environment called JRE which provided an execution environment instances called Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to enable the running of Java applications as Java bytecodes (conversion of high-level code to machine level code). The theme of the Java application development is Write Once and Run Anywhere while developing applications. It is most popular in client-server application development. It is licensed under GNU General Public License and is being supported by Java Community Process. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJava has multiple functional programming features such as Java Stream API, Java IO enhancements, Java Time API, Lambda Expressions, Functional Interfaces, Concurrency, and Java Collection Framework API improvements.

Welcome to Master Practical Java Development. This course is designed to help you master the most in-demand and critical components for becoming a Core Java developer. Especially if you\u0027re going for a job interview or have a Java Project that needs your best performance. This course assumes no prior java experience so prior Java so it will take you from zero to hero. The topics covered include Object Orientation which I think is not stressed enough in other Java courses so I\u0027ve got special focus on that throughout the lectures. You\u0027ll get plenty of practice writing classes and interfaces as well as countless methods with loops and if else statements, exception handling and file processing as well as how to debug software using Eclipse. You\u0027ll also be mastering the collections framework and diving deep into java generics. You\u0027ll learn all there is to know about multi-threading and the JDBC API for working with a MySQL database. There are also practical projects scattered throughout the course so that you can practice the concepts as you learn them. \u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/java-certification-course-with-interview-questions/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5680704_1c94.jpg","duration":"18 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"4,152.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Anyone interested in breaking into the Java development career","Those who have never programmed before, and wish to start their journey with Java"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":9,"averageValue":"4.7"},"instructors":[{"name":"EDUCBA Bridging the Gap","url":"/user/premananda-suna/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.6666665}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"EDUCBA2NY2024","originalPrice":"\u20B93,499","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"2 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/production-operations-management/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5621872,"title":"Production \u0026 Operations Management","shortDescription":"Manufacturing process| Network Analysis| Break Even Point Analysis| optimization| JIT| Quality| Production| Operations|","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EIf there is any activity that directly affects a business, it is production. As a matter of fact, most of the businesses began their thought processes through the production concept.

By taking such a step, the aim of the private equity firm is to earn a return of 20 -25 percent which is far in excess of the \u201Chistorical average annual return\u201D in case of the stock markets. The leveraged buyouts are more or less same to the normal deals of merger and acquisitions; the only difference is that in a leveraged buyout, the assumption is that the buyer will be selling the target in future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe working of the Concept of Leveraged BuyOut and LBO Model\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere exists a similarity between purchasing a house and leveraged buyout as a combination of down payment as well as a mortgage can be made use of. In the case of both these transactions, there is saving of money as a small amount is put down in cash and the remaining is borrowed. In case of the leveraged buyout, the \u201Cdown payment\u201D is known as the equity or the cash whereas the \u201Cmortgage\u201D is known as the debt. The debt is utilised by the private equity firms for boosting its returns. If everything else is equivalent, it means that if the private equity firm makes use of more leverage or debt, the firm is likely to earn a higher rate of return on the investment that has been made by it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as the real LBO model is concerned, the repayment of debt is made by the companies over a period of time which boosts the returns of the private equity firm even more. The numbers show a significant improvement with leverage due to the following reasons \u2013\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat money is worth today is higher than what it will be worth in future- This means that earning higher amount of money 5 years from now will be great, however, it is much better t=if that same amount of money is saved today because of money\u2019s time value.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEarning a higher amount of return on a money of a smaller amount is much more easy\u2013 It is difficult for the portfolio managers with thousands of crores under management to earn rates of return that are high, however for individual investors who have for example made investments of less than one crore, it is much easier to earn returns that are higher. This is the reason why leverage is used by the private equity firms. It goes on to boost their returns in a significant way by bringing reductions in the upfront investment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBuilding a LBO Model\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELBO Modeling is a process that can be divided into 8 steps.

I didn\u0027t like the way my podcast was going because I was saying, \u0022um\u0022 and using the word \u0022and\u0022 a lot. I also said \u0022you know\u0022 quite a bit. I was pretty good at editing, but I wanted to be better. This course helped me to understand that no one is perfect and how to improve on what I don\u0027t like about my delivery.
