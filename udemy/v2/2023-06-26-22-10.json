You will Learn from the best Business and Make Profit !","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EThere\u2019s a HUGE difference between simply operating a used car dealership business and operating a profitable used car dealership. To get a better idea of the possible demand for used cars in your area, you\u2019ll need to crunch some numbers. By knowing the number of used cars sold in your area every year and month , you can estimate what percentage of the market you will be likely to be able to corner and reach. By locating the average profit per vehicle, you can get an approximate idea of how much profit and money your dealership able to make per year. While the groundwork associated with opening a dealership can be time-consuming, expensive, and demanding, the real test of your dealership\u2019s viability doesn\u2019t begin until after you open your doors to the public. Without the right management of your dealership, all the effort you put into laying the foundation will be wasted. While each state has its own rules and regulations, there are several important universal aspects of operating a car dealership and tips on how you can get the most out of your investment. Your customers are the single most important factor in the success or failure of your business, so taking the time to identify who they are and what they care about is absolutely vital. Take a look at the types of cars you plan on selling, then do some research to determine the age, gender, and income level of the average individual who owns those types of vehicles. Later down the line, this will allow you to tailor your marketing and advertising efforts toward those who are most likely to be interested in what you have to offer. Make sure to base any of your conclusions regarding your target clients on real actionable data; don\u2019t simply make assumptions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/car-flipping-earn-money-from-selling-used-cars-ocsaly/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4741312_7b69_3.jpg","duration":"1.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"22,942.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Beginner Used Car Business Leaders"],"tags":["Car Flipping"],"rating":{"count":74,"averageValue":"4.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"OCSALY Academy | 210.000\u002B Students","url":"/user/online-academy-of-computer-science/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.03125}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"19USD_JUNE2029","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"3 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-guide-become-a-six-figure-online-course-instructor/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4789478,"title":"Build a Profitable Online Courses Business [Complete Guide]","shortDescription":"Learn online course creation \u0026 marketing for coaches \u0026 teachers to create \u0026 sell Online Courses for passive income 2022","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMake Passive Income by converting your skills into an Online Course \u0026amp; Selling it!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can use this course to plan and design your online course and then step by step guide to produce and publish your online course with some Insider marketing hacks to promote your course and sell online course.

Genetics is concerned primarily with understanding\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebiological properties that are transmitted from parent tooffspring. The subject matter of genetics includes hered-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eity, the molecular nature of the genetic material, the waysin which genes (which determine the characteristics of\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eorganisms) control life functions, and the distributionand behavior of genes in populations.Genetics is central to biology because gene activityunderlies all life processes, from cell structure and function to reproduction. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearning what genes are, how genes are transmitted from generation to generation\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehe principles of heredity were not understood untilthe mid-nineteenth century, when Gregor Mendel ana-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Elyzed quantitatively the results of crossing pea plants thatvaried in easily observable characteristics. He published\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehis results, but their significance was not realized in hislifetime. Several years after his death, however, re-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esearchers realized that Mendel had discovered fundamental principles of heredity\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe structure of DNA was first described in 1953, andsince that time genetics has become one of the most excit-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eing and ground-breaking sciences. Our understanding ofgene structure and function has progressed rapidly since\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emolecular techniques were developed to clone or amplifygenes, and rapid methods for sequencing DNA became\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eavailable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EResearch in genetics underwent a revolution in 1972,when Paul Berg constructed the first recombinant DNA\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emolecule in vitro, and in 1973, when Herbert Boyer andStanley Cohen cloned a recombinant DNA molecule for\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe first time. The development by Kary Mullis in 1986of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Especific segments of DNA spawned another revolution.Recombinant DNA technology, PCR, and other molecular\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etechnologies are leading to an ever-increasing number ofexciting discoveries that are furthering our knowledge of\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebasic biological functions and will lead to improvementsin the quality of human life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E In recent years, the sequencing of the genomes ofa large number of viruses and organisms has changed thescope of experiments performed by geneticists.

This is basically an extensive project based course where you will be fully guided step by step on how to build autonomous vehicle simulation with self driving feature using Python programming language alongside with Python libraries, such as Pygame and NEAT where Pygame will be utilised to create a visual and realistic representation of the simulated environment while NEAT which stands for NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies will be used to train the neural networks to control and design self driving behaviour. The neural network takes input from the car\u0027s sensors. In addition, the neural network will also learn and adapt over time through evolutionary algorithms, improving the car\u0027s driving performance and decision-making skills. In the introduction session, you will be learning the basic fundamentals of autonomous car, getting to know technologies behind it as well as understanding how it works. Then, after learning the basic concepts, you will be guided step by step to set up all necessary tools, for instance Visual Studio Code IDE, installing Python, and other relevant tools. Before getting into the project, there will be a basic python training session where you will learn all important concepts in Python that you need to know and master to prepare you for the upcoming project. The basic Python training session is optional since the session was created and intended only for those who are not very confident with their Python programming skills. In the basic Python training session, you will learn different data types or variables, how to build functions and pass down parameters to the function, how to build class, and basic fundamentals of Pygame. Then, once the basic Python training session has been completed, you will move to the project where you will be fully guided step by step on how to build an autonomous car simulation with advanced self driving features from scratch. Once the project has been built, we are going to be conducting testing, not only to test if the code works but also to test if the output of the code is what we expected to get. There will be three main objectives that will be tested, those are the car\u0027s decision making ability, sensor integration, and collision prevention.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, we need to ask ourselves this question. Why should we learn how to build an autonomous car simulator? It might be very interesting to learn how the self-driving feature in cars like Tesla works, obviously the system is very complicated and a bit difficult to be understood but what if you have a chance to learn the self driving mechanism from a more simple perspective and that\u2019s exactly what you are going to learn in this course. The next follow up question might potentially be, well it is near impossible and definitely unrealistic to create my own real autonomous vehicle like Tesla, it will cost you a lot and even if you have the funding, you might not have the right skill sets and knowledge to begin with. That is actually true to some extent, we are not going to build a brand new car with self -driving features, instead, we can potentially build a very cool self-driving game or maybe build an autonomous object simulator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow are things that we are going to learn from this course:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearning the fundamental

Some of the online communities for learning purposes are \u003Cstrong\u003EStackOverflow\u003C/strong\u003E, \u003Cstrong\u003EJava Forums\u003C/strong\u003E, etc. Also, there is a lot of resources like \u003Cstrong\u003EGeeksforGeeks\u003C/strong\u003E etc. available on the internet regarding Java.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E4. Java has an abundant API:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EJava has an abundant Application Programming Interface (API) that includes many Java classes, packages, interfaces, etc. This is useful for constructing applications without necessarily knowing their inside implementations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJava has mainly three types of API i.e. \u003Cstrong\u003EOfficial Java core API\u2019s, Optional official Java API\u2019s and Unofficial API\u2019s.\u003C/strong\u003E These API\u2019s overall are used for almost everything including networking, I/O, databases, media, XML parsing, speech synthesis, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E5. Java has multiple Open Source Libraries:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOpen-source libraries have resources that can be copied, studied, changed, shared, etc. There are multiple open-source libraries in Java such as \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJHipster, Maven, Google Guava, Apache Commons\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E, etc. that can be used to make Java development easier, cheaper and faster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E6. Java has Powerful Development Tools:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThere are many Integrated development environments (IDE\u2019s) in Java that provide various facilities for software development to programmers. Powerful Java IDE\u2019s such as \u003Cstrong\u003EEclipse, NetBeans, IntelliJ IDEA, etc.\u003C/strong\u003E play a big role in the success of Java.\u003Cbr\u003EThese IDE\u2019s provide many facilities such as debugging, syntax highlighting, code completion, language support, automated refactoring, etc. that make coding in Java easier and faster.\u003Cbr\u003EJava has created a base for the Android operating system and opted around \u003Cstrong\u003E90% of fortune 500 companies\u003C/strong\u003E to developing a lot of back-end applications. Also, it plays a great role in Apache Hadoop data processing, Amazon Web Services, and Windows Azure, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E7. Java is Free of Cost:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOne of the reasons Java is very popular among individual programmers is that it is available under the Oracle Binary Code License (BCL) free of charge. This means that Java is free for development and test environments, but for commercial purposes, a small fee is required.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E8. Java is Platform Independent:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EJava is platform-independent as the Java source code is converted to byte code by the compiler which can then be executed on any platform using the Java Virtual Machine. Java is also known as a WORA (write once, run anywhere) language because it is platform-independent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the development of most Java applications occurs in a Windows environment while they are run on a UNIX platform because of the platform-independent nature of Java.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E9. Java has great Documentation Support:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe documentation support for Java is excellent using \u003Cstrong\u003EJavadoc\u003C/strong\u003E which is the documentation generator for Java. It uses the Java source code to generate the API documentation in HTML format. So, Javadoc provides a great reference while coding in Java so that understanding the code is quite simple.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E10. Java is Versatile:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EJava is very versatile as it is used for programming applications on the web, mobile, desktop, etc. using different platforms. Also, Java has many features such as dynamic coding, multiple security features, platform-independent characteristics, network-centric designing, etc. that make it quite versatile.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to learn Java from scratch without any prior experience in programming then you should go for \u003Cstrong\u003EJava Foundation Course\u003C/strong\u003E.

W\u003Cstrong\u003Ehen we make a piece of art we\u0027re working with and arranging the elements of design on that 2D surface.\u003C/strong\u003E Elements are the visible things we can see, form, shape, space, texture, line value, and of course, \u003Cstrong\u003ECOLOR\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese elements are the makeup of a piece of art. In other classes, I\u0027ll go into each of these other elements in more detail. But for this class, we\u0027re going to just dive into color. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EColor is really an amazing thing. According to scientists, the human eye can detect millions upon millions of unique colors. So how can we possibly translate this complex thing in to our art? Well, in this class I\u0027ll explain the properties of color so that you understand it a little better. I also want to share some principles that had been tried by artists before us and have proved successful, so that the use of color in our art is made a bit simpler. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThe more we understand about color and the other elements of design, the better our compositions will be. \u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn making this color class, I realized that everyone has slightly different thoughts about color. I personally believe that there is no end-all be-all, and that there are no exact color rules. In fact, I think many different approaches to color and color theory can work successfully. So please don\u0027t walk away from this class and think if you don\u0027t follow one of these ideas then your piece is going to fail. Certainly not. Think of this class, these color schemes, and these ideas as a jumping off point to help inspire you and get you started. All subjects and color mediums are welcome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EI\u0027d love to see you in class and help you tackle what can be an intimidating element of design.

It was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994. The PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group. PHP originally stood for \u003Cem\u003EPersonal Home Page\u003C/em\u003E, but it now stands for the recursive initialism \u003Cem\u003EPHP: Hypertext Preprocessor\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPHP code is usually processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module, a daemon, or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. On a web server, the result of the interpreted and executed PHP code \u2013 which may be any type of data, such as generated HTML or binary image data \u2013 would form the whole or part of an HTTP response. Various web template systems, web content management systems, and web frameworks exist which can be employed to orchestrate or facilitate the generation of that response. Additionally, PHP can be used for many programming tasks outside of the web context, such as standalone graphical applications and robotic drone control. Arbitrary PHP code can also be interpreted and executed via a command-line interface (CLI).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe standard PHP interpreter, powered by the Zend Engine, is free software released under the PHP License. PHP has been widely ported and can be deployed on most web servers on almost every operating system and platform, free of charge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe PHP language evolved without a written formal specification or standard until 2014, with the original implementation acting as the \u003Cem\u003Ede facto\u003C/em\u003E standard which other implementations aimed to follow. Since 2014, work has gone on to create a formal PHP specification.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs of January 2021, 72% of PHP websites use discontinued versions of PHP, i.e. PHP 7.2 or lower, which are no longer supported by The PHP Development Team. A large additional fraction uses PHP 7.3, which is only (up to December 6, 2021) \u0022supported for critical security issues only.\u0022 Over 40% of all PHP websites use version 5.6 or older, which not even Debian supports (Debian 9 supported version 7.0 and 7.1).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBeginner Friendliness\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEasy to Get Started With\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPHP was designed to make web development easier, and many beginners find it effortless to pick up and get started with. In fact, PHP code was so easy to pick up, many non-programmers end up being able to hack PHP code together without truly understanding the code. While good programmers will never copy and paste code they don\u0027t understand, this speaks volumes about how easy it is to pick up PHP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe latest version of PHP (PHP8) has fixed a lot of inconsistencies and fatal errors as well. PHP has a wealth of learning resources, but you should make sure to avoid outdated tutorials.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFlexible\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPHP is a dynamically typed language.
