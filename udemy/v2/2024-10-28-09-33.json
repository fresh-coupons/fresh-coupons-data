One reason is that it is very easy to use. Unlike Windows batch files, which can be quite complex and difficult to understand, Bash scripts are much simpler and easier to read. This makes them perfect for automating tasks that would otherwise be tedious and time-consuming.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAnother reason why Linux Bash scripting is so useful is because it is extremely versatile.

I currently work as a Cybersecurity consultant with the Scotcoin Project CIC since my University days in 2016. I have worked in the IT industry since 1997 when I worked as a first-line support analyst at BT Internet helpdesk in Thurso, Caithness in the far north of Scotland. My main aim is to pass on my knowledge to students who wish to learn about cybersecurity and go on to get a well-paid job in the IT industry. I believe that organisations must embrace a comprehensive approach to cybersecurity that considers the ever-changing nature of the threat landscape. New threats to security crop up all the time, and artificial intelligence is changing how we think about it. The advent of quantum cryptography has also changed things. The processing power of computers is miles faster than it used to be and can crack passwords much quicker. The issue of cybersecurity is of paramount importance in the digital age.
