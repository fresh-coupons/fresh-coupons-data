This is a comprehensive project based course where you will learn step by step on how to conduct sentiment analysis and emotional detection on customer review and twitter post datasets using TextBlob, Natural Language Toolkit, and BERT models. This course is a perfect combination between theory and hands-on application, providing you with practical skills to extract valuable insights from textual data. This course will be mainly focusing on two major objectives, the first one is data analysis where you will explore the customer review and twitter post datasets from multiple perspectives, meanwhile the second objective is sentiment analysis where you will learn to detect emotions and bias from customer reviews and twitter posts. In the introduction session, you will learn the basic fundamentals of sentiment analysis, such as getting to know its practical applications and models that will be used in our projects. Then, in the next session, we are going to have a case study where you will learn how sentiment analysis actually works. We are going to use customer reviews dataset to perform feature extraction and make predictions if a review is more likely to be positive, negative, or neutral. Afterward, you will also learn about several factors that contribute to bias in customer reviews, for examples like algorithmic amplification, emotional bias, and financial incentives. After learning all necessary knowledge about sentiment analysis, we will begin the project. Firstly you will be guided step by step on how to set up Google Colab IDE. In addition to that, you will also learn how to find and download customer reviews and twitter post dataset from Kaggle. Once everything is all set, we will enter the main section of the course which is the project section. The project will consist of two main parts, in the first part, you will learn step by step on how to perform sentiment analysis on customer reviews dataset, you will extensively learn how to make accurate predictions whether the review indicates customer\u2019s satisfaction or dissatisfaction based on the training data. Meanwhile, in the second part you will be guided step by step on how to perform sentiment analysis on twitter posts dataset, specifically you will analyse the emotional aspect of the tweets using Natural Language Toolkit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, before getting into the course, we need to ask ourselves this question: why should we learn sentiment analysis? Well, there are many reasons why, but here is my answer, with the rise of E-commerce and businesses starting to expand their market online, as a result, more and more customers are starting to purchase products online and after purchasing the product, most likely they will also leave reviews telling their opinions about the product. In addition to that, sometimes they also have meaningful discussions about a specific product on social media. However, not a lot of people realize that those customer reviews and social media posts can potentially be transformed into valuable insights for the business, for instance, by evaluating the complaints from the customers in the review section, the company will be able to make better business decisions and improve the quality of their products based on their customer suggestions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow are things that you can expect to learn from this course:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn the basic fundamentals of sentiment analysis and its practical applications\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECase study: applying sentiment analysis on customer review dataset and predict if a review is more likely to be positive, negative or neutral\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn factors that contribute to bias in customer reviews\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to find and download datasets from Kaggle\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to clean dataset by removing missing rows and duplicate values\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to find correlation between customer ratings and sentiment\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to identify keywords that are frequently used in positive and negative customer reviews\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to analyse emotional aspect of customer reviews using EmoLex\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to perform sentiment analysis on customer review data using TextBlob\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to analyse emotional aspect of tweets using NRCLex\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to perform sentiment analysis on twitter post data using VADER\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to predict sentiment of a tweet using BERT\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to predict sentiment of a tweet using Multinomial Naive Bayes\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to set up Google Colab IDE\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/performing-sentiment-analysis-on-customer-reviews-tweets/","imageUri":"https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5667026_6644.jpg","duration":"3 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"643.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["People who are interested in performing sentiment analysis on customer reviews and tweets dataset","People who are interested in detecting emotions using NRCLex"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":0,"averageValue":"0.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"Christ Raharja","url":"/user/christ-raharja/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":0}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"ED52641CCAB934CBCD03","originalPrice":"\u20B91,999","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/chatgpt-practice-tests-and-interview-questions-basic-and-advanced/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5190860,"title":"ChatGPT Practice Tests and Interview Questions - Basic/Adv","shortDescription":"Best collection of Practice Tests and Interview Questions around ChatGPT, LLM \u0026 Prompt Engineering","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to this exciting Udemy course on ChatGPT language learning model!

CSR is about how corporations manage the business practices to generate an overall positive impact on the society. CSR policy would ideally function as an integrated, self-regulating mechanism whereby companies would monitor and ensure their support to ethical standards, law, and international norms. As a result, companies would accept responsibility for its activities\u2019 impact on the environment, employees, consumers, stakeholders, and communities. Additionally, CSR-focused organizations would proactively advance the public interest by promoting community growth and development, as well as voluntarily abolishing practices that harm the community. Basically, CSR is the intentional inclusion of public interest into business decision-making.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECorporate social responsibility courses include many elements, but in general, it is what companies do to help others or the environment. Many years ago companies were only interested in their profit margin and keeping their shareholders happy. These days many have come to understand that for the greatest sustainability, employees, customers, the general community and the environment are all important.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey realize that if they are seen to be polluting the environment, for instance, they will get a bad reputation that will impact on their standing in the community and perhaps even their end profits. But if they are seen to be doing something to protect the environment then the man in the street will accept and embrace them, thus creating an element that is even more important than short-term profits, viz. sustainability and popularity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is not only about the environment of Corporate Social Responsibility courses, but also taking care of people \u2013 employees or the general public, or both. After all, in many cases, it is the general public who makes or breaks a company, especially if they are selling products or providing services. If a company develops such a bad reputation for greedy profit at the expense of people, their sales will go down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo this end, there must be corporate volunteering to do the right thing because as yet there are no laws to enforce corporate social responsibility courses. Business volunteers will find that establishing ethical behaviors in the business is not so hard once they get into it and volunteering overseas is particularly rewarding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVolunteering for a leadership development program is one good way to start as you can then Corporate Social Responsibility courses learn what needs to be done in this area and develop actions to carry your plans through. Even within the company, there will be many ways in which such ethics can be implemented to give employees the support they need. It might be as simple as ensuring that the workplace is safe, or beginning a program to help employees that may be addicted to the company\u2019s
