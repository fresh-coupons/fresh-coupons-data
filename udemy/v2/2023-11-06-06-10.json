By making sense of what\u0027s said and not said; what\u0027s done and not done, we can make sense of everything. We\u0027re better at receiving and processing information, and finding solutions with it. Our intrinsic sense of justice is rooted in empathy, which strengthens bonds of trust.

Hopefully, by then, you will yourself be in the position to create the melody of any song you want or ever wished to play in thev voice like Flute, violin, guitar etc, and imagine, if you can play what the singer is singing (vocals) on your keyboard called (Lead) in any of your favorite instrument\u0027s voice, it will really be a\u0026nbsp; dream come true if you are a\u0026nbsp; passionate lover and learner of music. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIsn\u0027t it exciting thing\u0026nbsp; that you not need to buy even a keyboard. But you have various apps and your mobile phone has been virtually converted to a musical keyboard. You may even attach your mobile to speaker to play in a family or friends gathering after you have got the confidence. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven more exciting is that as the sound is produced from mobile, there are no issues of recording. And if you buy a real keyboard or harmonium/Harmonica, you will play it in the same way as you will learn in this course. If you like this course, you may ask for Flute \u0026amp; violin lessons if you may want. But for those lessons you have to buy a good quality Flute \u0026amp; or a good quality violin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck to all of my students \u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-to-play-electric-keyboard-notes/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5547458_024e_3.jpg","duration":"1.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"1,799.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["For any one who wants to learn the keyboard and piano without buying a keyboard.","For any one who wants to play any musical instrument to learn the basics without buying any instrument."],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":1,"averageValue":"3.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"Prof. Dr. Shahzad Waseem","url":"/user/prof-dr-shahzad-waseem/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":3}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"86ED30C04B5CA881EBAC","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"3 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/css-bootstrap-javascript-and-php-stack-complete-course/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4435576,"title":"CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript And PHP Stack Complete Course","shortDescription":"CSS, Bootstrap And JavaScript And PHP Complete Frontend and Backend Course","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003ELearn CSS and Bootstrap and Javascript and PHP Programming all in one complete course \u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003Esection 1- CSS course with basics and advanced concepts of CSS\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eever wonder how the latest website designs are made?

It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables.

The CRM process typically consists of several key stages:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00B7 Customer Identification: This is the first step in the CRM process. It involves identifying potential customers and capturing relevant information about them. This information may include contact details, demographics, preferences, and purchase history.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00B7 Customer Acquisition: Once potential customers are identified, the next step is to acquire them as actual customers. This can involve various marketing and sales strategies, such as advertising, lead generation, and sales outreach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00B7 Customer Onboarding: After acquiring new customers, it\u0027s essential to ensure a smooth onboarding process.

This stage involves building and maintaining relationships by providing value, addressing questions or concerns, and delivering exceptional customer service.
