In this course you will learn to harness the power of JavaScript, XML, AJAX, and React to build highly interactive web pages from scratch. We start with an introduction into the document object model, followed by an in-depth guide to the essentials of JavaScript. In the JavaScript section you will learn a number of concepts instrumental towards your journey as a developer. This includes working with variables, arithmetic operators, objects, functions, arrays, events, and loops. You will also learn the importance of JavaScript placement, while working with both internal and external JavaScript code components. Students learn the importance of operator precedence when performing simple and complex arithmetic operations. Furthermore, you will have the opportunity to work with conditional statements to perform comparisons between different operations. Once you have a handle on the foundations, we\u2019ll dive into a number of JavaScript development projects where you will have an opportunity to apply your new skills with practical hands-on exercises. This includes building an automated background color changer, and photo gallery complete with mouse overs and image transitions.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn the second section of the course we will explore XML and AJAX to demonstrate the power of asynchronous page updates. This means building web components that automatically update on a web page, without having to manually refresh. You will have an opportunity to work with both XML and AJAX in conjunction with JavaScript to build modern web app components such as a search suggest feature, and a pre-populated select menu.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOnce you have a foundational understanding of JavaScript and AJAX, we will dive into working with React, a powerful JavaScript library used for front-end UI development. The React section starts off with a hands-on project where you\u2019ll learn how to work with functional React components, props, Callback functions, OnClick Events, and the React State hook to build a fully functional calculator. From there we will dive into project number two, where you will build a connect-4 clone. Here we will cover more intermediate concepts including passing props, de-structuring, passing arguments to click events, various styling methods, and handling callbacks. You will also learn about the React key property, React lifecycle events, and conditional rendering. By the end you will have built a complete multi and single player connect-4 game board with built-in AI capabilities. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn the final section of the course we further unleash the power of React by building out a complete e-commerce site with multiple product categories, a product showcase, shopping cart feature, and much more. Here, we introduce a number of integral new concepts including: JSON server, Fetch API, and installing React router. These essential building blocks will be used to render the product categories, style the product list, and configure the product details page. From there we dive into styled components, refactoring the shop layout, and exploring the concept of \u201Ccontext\u201D in React. In the final stages of the project students will configure the shopping cart basket, and the checkout feature. We will also implement a product search feature, followed by in-depth exercises on validating input forms in React.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAs you can see this course covers a tremendous bit of ground. Best of all it\u2019s co-authored by Tim Maclachlan - a renowned senior full-stack developer with over 20 years of commercial development experience.

Even if you\u2019re just looking to build profile, you need a strong internet presence, if you want people to know you exist. The purpose of Digital Marketing is to raise awareness, connect with people who are interested in what you\u2019re offering, and persuade them to take actions you want. It uses digital forms of communication like the web, smartphones, social media platforms, and search engines, as a medium to reach potential customers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust like traditional marketing, digital marketing, is about finding prospective customers and broadcasting your message to them in the right place, in the right tone, and at the right time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDigital Marketing has one major advantage over traditional marketing as you can use analytics tools to monitor your campaigns in real time, so you can swiftly adjust your approach. Typically, it would cost more and take longer to make these kinds of adjustments, but with Digital Marketing it\u2019s easier to course correct than it would be if you had invested in a print ad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat is Social Media?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESocial Media is an umbrella term to describe online platforms focused on community-based communication, such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.

Social media also includes curation sites such as wikis, as well as professional networking platforms like LinkedIn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDue to the massive reach of Social Media, good social media marketing skills are now essential for anyone looking to attract the maximum number of customers online.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat is SEO?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESEO, or Search engine optimization, is the science of attracting specific types of traffic to a website using a search engine.

That means you need to optimise your site for the type of search engine you want it to rank highly on, like Google, Amazon, or Bing. SEO typically focuses on scoring highly organic search results, not paid or sponsored traffic, but you can also use it in paid ads, to maximise their reach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs search engines attempt to give the most suitable answer to each person\u2019s search query, you must ensure a search engine views your site as the most appropriate match.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEvery search engine uses a different algorithm to determine what the best result to a search query is.

It includes understanding how rich snippets, video, and featured snippets work to enhance your rankings as well as the importance of voice search and Video SEO.

Near Me searches have grown even faster, exploding at a rate of 150% more than local searches alone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMastering SEO also includes understanding Technical SEO, which focuses on priming your website for crawling and indexing by search engines. It\u2019s important you don\u2019t neglect this aspect, as without it search engines will find it much more difficult to access, crawl, and index your website. As a result, you will rank much lower.

This is a comprehensive course that will guide you step by step on how to start your AI automation agency business. For those of you who are not familiar with AI automation agency, this business model is very similar to SMMA or Social Media Marketing Agency where you work to help your clients to optimize their business and generate more revenue, the only difference is instead of running ads, you will help them to build AI chatbot, automate their marketing, automate their lead generation, and even help them to build website or landing page using AI. In the introduction session, you will learn the basic fundamentals of AI automation agency business models, such as getting to know business processes that can be automated using AI and issues commonly faced by local businesses which can be solved using AI. Then, you will continue by learning how to find prospective clients on Linkedin, Fiverr, and Upwork, in addition to that, you will also learn how to do cold calling and send cold emails to your prospective clients. Afterward, you will enter the project section where you will learn four different services that you can offer as an AI automation agency to your clients, the first service is to build AI chatbot using AI tools like Chatshape and Chatbase, the second service is to automate lead generation using AI tools like Pressbot, HeyLibby, and Marbelflows, the third service is to build website and landing page using AI tools like Turbosite and Sitekick, meanwhile the fourth service is to do marketing automation using AI tools like Gista and Automata IO. Once you have learnt all those four services, you will also learn how to build and design website for your AI automation agency using another AI tool called B12, at the end of the course you will also learn pricing and marketing strategies, where we will be comparing several pricing models, such as hourly rates, fixed price, and commission based price, meanwhile, for marketing, we will go over several effective marketing strategies that you can implement to get more prospective clients, such as social media marketing, content marketing, and building email list.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, before getting into the course, we need to ask this question to ourselves. Why should we build an artificial intelligence automation agency? Well, there are many answers to that question, as artificial intelligence technologies have advanced very rapidly in the past couple years, therefore, more and more businesses from all industries started to adopt AI to automate their business process and also to generate more revenue. This basically means that there is high demand for AI related services in the market, for example building AI chatbots and other AI integrations. Hence, this is definitely the right time for you to use this amazing opportunity to establish a sustainable agency business. Last but not least, starting an AI automation agency business does not require a high upfront cost because it is a service based business and your profit margin is also relatively higher compared to other business models, such as E-commerce and print on demand.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow are things that you can expect to learn from this course:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn the basic fundamentals of AI automation agency business, such as getting to know common issues faced by local businesses and how to utilize AI to solve those issues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to find prospective clients for your AI automation agency by using Linkedin, Fiverr, Upwork, and cold email\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to build AI chatbots for your clients using Chatshape, Chatbase, and Build Chatbot AI.

Did you build a couple of projects with PHP and MySQL, but you still think you are inexperienced and you are missing out on a lot of things when coming to developing bigger projects? If yes, then this course is the right resource for you. This course is very digestible and informative and it was created specifically to enhance your coding skills and knowledge not just in PHP and MySQL, but overall in developing web projects. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is what we are going to do in this course. Naturally, we are going to get started by setting up the right tools for our projects. And after that, we are going to build our first simple yet very interesting project and that\u0027s a payment page with Paypal. The second project will be about a simple forum system. They are going to be also a couple of generic projects like the full CRUD\u0026nbsp;app and so on. After this, the next project will be the starting of something big because it\u0027s an authentication system where I am going to teach you how to develop a login and a register page, how to hash and de-hash passwords, how to do validation and so much more. After this, we are going to build a comments system and this will be the biggest project in this course. We will begin first by doing a post system and then we will grab comments for every post that we have of course we will use Ajax-JQuery for inserting, deleting, and showing comments. after that, we will integrate a rating system into the previous two projects to make a bigger project. So, I will show how to download a JQuery plugin, how to integrate it and how to use it to do the rating system for every post, and so on. And the rating system is going to be implemented of course using Ajax-JQuery. The upcoming project is going to be also created with Ajax and JQuery and that\u0027s a live search system and we will combine it with our big project. There are a lot of projects along the way but it\u0027s going to take a very long time to talk about them. So I will let you discover the many benefits of this course.
