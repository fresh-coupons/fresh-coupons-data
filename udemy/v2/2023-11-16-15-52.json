The development by Kary Mullis in 1986of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Especific segments of DNA spawned another revolution.Recombinant DNA technology, PCR, and other molecular\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etechnologies are leading to an ever-increasing number ofexciting discoveries that are furthering our knowledge of\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebasic biological functions and will lead to improvementsin the quality of human life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E In recent years, the sequencing of the genomes ofa large number of viruses and organisms has changed thescope of experiments performed by geneticists.
