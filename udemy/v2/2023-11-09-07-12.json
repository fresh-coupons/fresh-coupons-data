Here, you will learn how to deploy fully scalable React web apps on some of the most powerful cloud computing platforms available, including AWS and Linode. The course starts with exploring the foundations of cloud computing where we dive into a comprehensive overview of the three main cloud service models. This includes: Infrastructure as a Service, Platform as a Service, and Software as a Service. From there we offer an in-depth guide to deploying and configuring virtual instances and the foundations of remote server administration and server security using SSH. Students are then introduced to Linux, where we explore various Linux distributions, the Linux filesystem, and essential Linux maintenance and directory commands. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOnce students have a handle on working with Linux, we\u2019ll dive into the foundations of Web Servers. Here, we\u2019ll explore two industry leaders in the server software space including Apache and NGINX. Students will learn the benefits and use cases of each server technology, combined with an in-depth technical analysis of their performance in production environments. From there we\u2019ll explore database management systems, including both SQL and NoSQL databases, coupled with database transaction standards. In this section students gain valuable insights into a variety of different database options available, and the best use case for each depending on the project type and complexity. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWith a firm handle on the theoretical aspects of web servers and DBMSes, we jump into a practical guide to setting up LAMP stack on Ubuntu through terminal for MacOS and PuTTY for Windows. Here we configure Linux with Apache, MariaDB, and PHP. Students will also learn how to upload data to a MariaDB database, and fetch records from within PHP scripts. The course then takes a theoretical and practical deep dive into server security. Here, we explore both network and hosted firewalls. We emphasize the pitfalls of lax server configurations, and provide a step-by-step guide to enabling and setting up UFW for Ubuntu. Students will also learn how to configure custom ports for SSH tunneling as an added layer of security.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe second half of the course provides a comprehensive guide to Amazon Web Services. We start with demonstrating how to setup, secure, and navigate an AWS account. This includes setting up billing alerts and multi-factor authentication. From there, we take a deep dive into AWS Identity and Access management for enhanced account security, and the management of user accounts for various AWS services. Here we explore IAM User management and permissions, IAM Groups, IAM Policies, and access key rotation. Following the IAM section, we\u2019ll jump into the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) service. In this module students lean to deploy virtual instances on AWS using Amazon Machine Images, Elastic IPs, and Launch Templates. We will also explore IAM roles for EC2, EC2 Security Groups, SSH key pair authentication, and remote administration using both terminal and EC2 Instance connect. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAfter students have a mastery of cloud computing, the next segment explores the development and deployment of interactive web apps using both JavaScript and React. Here we start with JavaScript foundations including the document object model, and DOM manipulation. From there, we hop into JavaScript variables, arithmetic operations, data types, objects, arrays, loops, functions, and events. The JavaScript section concludes with two hands-on projects where students build a background color changer, and photo gallery. After completion of the JavaScript section, students will use their new found skills to build out dynamic front-end UI components using the React JS library. Through a series of hands-on projects, students will build a calculator, Connect-4 Game clone, and a fully customizable e-commerce site. The react modules start from the basics and work up to several intermediate level concepts. This includes: working with code pen, JSX, Functional components, Props, Callbacks, Events, the React State hook, conditional rendering, Fetch API, Refactoring, and much more. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAs you can see this course covers a tremendous bit of ground.

The training program will help the trainee to perform all the statistical analysis with Minitab. It is also intended to make the trainees cover all the topics that fall under the domain of Minitab. Topics like Minitab GUI and Descriptive Statistics, Statistical Analysis using Minitab, Correlation Techniques in Minitab and Predictive Modeling using Excel will be covered in this training module and Project on Data Analytics using Minitab and Project on Minitab \u2013 Regression Modeling will be covered in the project module. The goal of this course is to help an individual to achieve knowledge of working with Minitab to perform time series analysis and forecasting of data in all sorts of statistics based problems. It will help all the interested trainees who are willing to extend their knowledge base concerned with Data analytics. This training will also assist the trainees to understand the sort of problems that could be resolved using this. After the finishing of the course, the trainee will advance with the skills needed for time series analysis and forecasting of data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo understand the meaning of the \u201Cname\u201D of the course, let us break down the curse and understand them word by word so that the intent of the course would be clear to our learners and we would set an expectation for our learners who would be pursuing the course. Let us start to understand what Minitab is. Minitab is a software used in use cases of statistics. Minitab, as the software is capable of data analysis, pattern detection through statistics, data crunching. Most of the calculation is automated, and graphs are generated as per the functionality required by the analyst working on the use cases. For this course specifically, we would be exploiting the use of Minitab for Time Series Analysis and Forecasting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, let us understand what time series analysis is. Time series data is a collection of data over some time or interval. The data when captured over time typically might have some internal structure, for example, autocorrelation, trends, seasonality, stationarity, and many such fundamentals. For example, let us think about the sales of umbrellas or raincoats. We can see that in the selling of these items we might encounter a seasonality aspect, that they might be sold high during the onset of the rainy season. Also, we can see that the data itself might auto-correlate itself to the promos that might have been set by some stores, online or offline, and many more such intricate detailing through the understanding of time series analysis fundamentals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow when we know how to analyze the time series it becomes pretty evident that what exactly to do with the studies or hypothesis we developed as a part of the study. The answer lies in prediction! We would understand the fundamentals through historical time series data and then utilize that deep insight to predict or forecast for the future. In this way, we would be able to capture the historical trends and seasonality and utilize them to have a better insight into what\u2019s in store in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis course is a collection of well-crafted tutorials or topics we would naturally go about if we must fully understand the topic of time series analysis and forecasting. This course will allow you to get a sense of what is lying in the basket of time series analysis in the professional project which you would encounter as soon as you take up the project in your organization. This course makes you reach that level of being the \u201Chandful\u201D of people who are capable of cracking even the toughest nut in the professional world.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis confidence you build in the course of this training will go a long way in not only analyzing the sense of time series data but also give you the capability to mentor people who would have just started their track on time series analysis. This course doesn\u2019t differentiate between a beginner or an advanced learner. We have to learn for everyone who is here to expand their horizon of knowledge. Lastly, we would like to mention that this course will lay a strong foundation in time series analysis so that you would be able to build a strong mansion on this foundation layer.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/predictive-modeling-and-time-series-analysis-with-minitab/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4722578_a844_3.jpg","duration":"2.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"11,037.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["We start everything from scratch and try to build from there and the only thing we require is a sense of perseverance and full dedication towards the course.

Includes JSX, Callbacks, Events, \u002B More","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EThis course takes you step-by-step through the process of building a fully functional calculator in React. React, also known as React JS, is a powerful JavaScript library used for building custom, interactive user interfaces using UI components. Some of the most well known examples of organizations using React for their front-end include Netflix, Facebook, and Airbnb. Developed and maintained by Meta along with a community of independent developers, React remains free and open-source. React is a component based library built entirely on JavaScript, which makes it perfect for designing complex UI\u2019s. With React, developers can build encapsulated components that efficiently manage their own state and render UI updates specifically when data changes. For example, think of the automated content refresh feature you see on a twitter feed, or facebook like button. Here the state of the UI component changes on the page, without having to manually refresh when the data is updated. This is just one small, yet powerful feature of React.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThrough a complete hands-on project, this course will teach you all the fundamental principles of React that you must know to become a proficient React developer. We start right from the basics, including the tools needed to get started. From there we dive into JSX, functional components, props, callbacks, and various OnClick events. By this stage, the calculator will have a complete visual display, coupled with functional arithmetic operations. Students then move on to passing parameters in Callback functions, using the React State Hook, and debugging.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn addition to the hands-on React module, we also offer a comprehensive overview of JavaScript for those who need a refresher. Here we start with introducing students to the document object model (DOM) which defines the logical structure of HTML documents. From there we dive into JavaScript to demonstrate various methods in which DOM elements can be manipulated to add interactivity to static components. We start right from the basics, which includes JavaScript placement, and data output. From there we move on to variable declaration, arithmetic operations, operator precedence, data types, and objects. Once the foundations are covered, we move on to more complex operations using Arrays, Conditional Statements, JavaScript comparison operators, booleans and loops. Here students will learn to unleash the true power of JavaScript to render different outcomes based on user interaction. We will explore the use of functions to efficiently handle repetitive tasks and JavaScript events to handle output based on actions and occurrences. The section will conclude with a hands-on project where students will implement their knowledge to build a web based photo gallery and background color changer. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAs you can see this course covers a tremendous bit of ground.

Now since python GUI is very specific to Python, let us look at what GUI essentially means, and then we may be able to jump into understanding specifically Python GUI. GUI or in other words, Graphical User Interface is a form of a connection tool through which users would be able to interact with electronic devices. This interaction is through the use of buttons and graphical icons which makes it visually appealing for users to use and the software behind the icons removes the robotic coding required to perform the particular task. The intention of the introduction of GUI is thought to reduce the commands that need to be typed at the command-line interface (CLI) through keyboard and that exactly what task it does!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow coming to Python GUI, let us say, for example, we would need to run a code in python, a .py file through the command line. We would create a simple GUI which might have a button \u201CRun\u201D and once a user clicks on that the python file which intends to run will automatically get selected and will run. What Python GUI would do essentially is remove the unnecessary coding part of running the python file through CLI.

In this course, you will learn how to effectively manage and optimize your storage on Amazon Web Services (AWS). This includes a comprehensive overview of the main forms of EC2 storage offered by AWS, including Elastic Block Store (EBS), Elastic File System (EFS), and Amazon Machine Images (AMI).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe course starts with the foundations of AWS, where we demonstrate how to register an AWS account. Students also learn the basics of AWS billing, global vs. regional services, and AWS multi-factor authentication (MFA). \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOnce students are familiar with navigating the AWS dashboard, we dive into working with the EC2 service. Here we explore the core features of EC2 instances, along with instance deployment, instance administration, and security. Students will learn how to create and deploy instances from Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) that are fully equipped with Elastic IP addresses, and remote access via terminal and PuTTY. We also cover a host of other integral concepts including IAM roles for EC2, Security Groups, and EC2 Instance Launch Templates. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAfter the EC2 section, we delve into AWS EC2 storage solutions. Here, we start with exploring the key differences between block, file, and object storage. From there, we take a deep dive into Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS). EBS is a block storage service provided by AWS which allows for the creation of virtual disks, called EBS volumes that can be attached to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances. These EBS volumes can be used as raw block devices, in order to store data, such as system files, application data, and virtual machine images. We will cover how to create, attach, and manage EBS volumes, as well as how to use EBS Snapshots to create point-in-time backups of your data. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EFrom there, we explore Amazon Machine Images (AMIs), which are templates that contain the software configuration and data required to launch an EC2 instance. We will cover how to create and customize AMIs, as well as how to use the EC2 Image Builder to automate the creation of AMIs. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn the last section, we introduce students to the Elastic File System (EFS), which is a file storage service provided by AWS. EFS allows you to create a file system that can be accessed by multiple EC2 instances to store and share files across multiple availability zones. We will cover how to create and manage EFS file systems, as well as how to mount EFS file systems on your EC2 instances. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EBy the end of this course, you will have a solid understanding of the various storage options available on AWS, and you will be able to confidently choose the right storage solution for your needs.

It provides us with the list of services and various tools which are required for building the Mobile User Interface with the native feel and the same look. The ionic framework needs to have a native wrapper interface using which it will be able to run the ionic based applications on mobile devices. Moreover, it can be known to be the front-end based HTML framework which comprises many front end languages, and therefore it is built on top of the possibly best front end framework, AngularJS, and Cordova. It is an HTML5 based Mobile Application development framework which is targeted at building mobile-based hybrid apps. Ionic can be thought of as a front end UI framework that is used to handle the basic look and feel and the User interface based interactions that are required for the app to be compelling. It is somewhat like Bootstrap for native applications that are built for the support of a broad range of common and basic native mobile-based components, beautiful design, and slick animations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe features would include AngularJS based Model View Controller architecture for creating and building rich SPAs also known as Single Page Applications particularly optimized for the device and mobile-based devices.

The default styling of the components can be easily overridden which can accommodate their designs. The JavaScript components extend the CSS component capabilities and also Javascript related functions and their capabilities to cover the mobile elements which cannot be only done with HTML and CSS. Other features include the ones related to Cordova plugins that offer the API related to the usage of the mobile-based native device functions with JavaScript code. The Ionic CLI is a NodeJS based utility which is powered by the various commands required for building, starting, running as well as emulating ionic applications.

In this course you will learn how to develop stylish, mobile responsive web pages right from scratch using some of the most powerful front-end mark-up languages and JavaScript libraries. The course starts with an in-depth overview of HTML where we start by exploring the structure of an HTML web page. Once you\u2019re comfortable with HTML foundations, we move on to demonstrating how to work with a number of HTML elements. This includes: Inline text elements, ordered and unordered lists, embedding media, link creation, tables, background images, form elements and iframes. The HTML segment concludes with a hands-on project that will guide you through creating a complete web page with headers, footers, callouts, images, links, forms and tabular data. By the end of the HTML segment, you\u2019ll be able to proficiently code simple and complex html pages with ease.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe second section of this course focuses exclusively on CSS to bring your web pages to life with custom style sheets. Here, students will learn the importance of responsive design and cross browser compatibility by embedding CSS style rules for individual page components. We start by exploring the parts, and types of CSS rules followed by an introduction into CSS Id\u2019s and divisions. From there we move on to CSS margins, text properties, borders, transparency and text on top of images. Once you have a handle on the foundations we move on to more intricate CSS concepts including CSS positioning, CSS float properties, Link Styling, and z-indexes. Similar to the HTML section, the CSS segment concludes with a comprehensive hands-on guide to building a responsive web page, complete with CSS style definitions, element containers, navigation, and a number of other CSS page elements.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOnce you have a foundational understanding of HTML and CSS, we will dive into working with React, a powerful JavaScript library used for front-end UI development. The React section starts off with a hands-on project where you\u2019ll learn how to work with functional React components, props, Callback functions, OnClick Events, and the React State hook to build a fully functional calculator. From there we will dive into project number two, where you will build a connect-4 clone. Here we will cover more intermediate concepts including passing props, destructuring, passing arguments to click events, various styling methods, and handling callbacks. You will also learn about the React key property, React lifecycle events, and conditional rendering. By the end you will have built a complete multi and single player connect-4 game board with built-in AI capabilities.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn the final section of the course we further unleash the power of React by building out a complete e-commerce site with multiple product categories, a product showcase, shopping cart feature, and much more. Here, we introduce a number of integral new concepts including: JSON server, Fetch API, and installing React router. These essential building blocks will be used to render the product categories, style the product list, and configure the product details page. From there we dive into styled components, refactoring the shop layout, and exploring the concept of \u201Ccontext\u201D in React. In the final stages of the project students will configure the shopping cart basket, and the checkout feature. We will also implement a product search feature, followed by in-depth exercises on validating input forms in React.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAs you can see this course covers a tremendous bit of ground.

However, to interact with these on-chain components, transactions need to be created on the blockchain.
