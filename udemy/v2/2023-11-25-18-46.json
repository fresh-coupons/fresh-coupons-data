To run a business at optimal capacity, you need to reduce or eliminate waste from processes and improve production flow. In this course, you\u0027ll learn about Lean strategies to reduce waste by determining which operations add value and which don\u0027t. You\u0027ll explore the concept of continuous flow, and discover how to balance work processes to make production flow more efficient. You\u0027ll define what waste is, where it exists, and what causes it. You\u0027ll also examine aspects of Muda, continuous flow, line balancing, value and non-value-add, and practical Lean techniques for improving Operations Management.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat is waste in Lean Manufacturing?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA core principle in lean methodology is the removal of waste within an operation. And in any business, one of the heaviest drains on profitability is waste. Lean waste can come in the form of time, material, and labor. But it may also be related to the utilization of skill-sets as well as poor planning. In lean manufacturing, waste is any expense or effort that is expended but which does not transform raw materials into an item the customer is willing to pay for. By optimizing process steps and eliminating waste, the only true value is added at each phase of production.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday, the Lean Manufacturing model recognizes 8 types of waste within an operation; seven originally conceived when the Toyota Production System was first conceived, and an eighth added when the lean methodology was adopted within the Western World. Seven of the eight wastes are production process-oriented, while the eighth waste is directly related to management\u2019s ability to utilize personnel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWHAT YOU WILL LEARN to\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eclassify production activities as a value-add, non-value-add, or necessary non-value-add.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eidentify strategies for eliminating waste caused by overproduction and inventory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eidentify strategies for eliminating motion, waiting, and transportation waste.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eidentify elimination strategies for waste caused by overprocessing and defects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ematch cycle time and takt time to their descriptions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eidentify the final three steps for balancing a production line\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/the-concept-of-waste/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4584528_2810_3.jpg","duration":"1 total hour","enrolledStudentsCount":"13,786.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Any professional, who is seeking career growth in the quality management sector","Managers, Supervisors, Team Leaders, CEO, and Senior Managers, who want to encourage continuous improvement for an organisation and responsible for developing lean thinking, practical skills, measurement of production staff, and analysing the performance of the employee in the workplace.","Individuals involved in a continuous improvement project who needs a complete overview of the process"],"tags":["Waste Management"],"rating":{"count":87,"averageValue":"4.1"},"instructors":[{"name":"Quality capsule ,Islam Arid","url":"/user/islam-arid/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":3.8541667}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"081DA92452D09BB9EBD4","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/linux-shell-scripting-beginner-course-2023/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5553092,"title":"Linux Shell Scripting Beginner Course 2023","shortDescription":"Build a Strong Foundation in Shell Scripting for Linux with Practical Skills and Hands-On Experience","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the \u0022Linux Shell Scripting Beginner Course 2023\u0022!
