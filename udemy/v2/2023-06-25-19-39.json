Indeed, by the end of this course you will have a strong and solid understanding of all the basics of C\u002B\u002B programming and will be able to create on your own various C\u002B\u002B programs and applications.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe structure of the course\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way this course have been structured and created is made to really help you learn and understand all the basics of this programming language. From the starting point where you will be installing the right tools and writing you first basic lines of code to the more advanced such as functions, statements, loops and many pratical projects, this course has everything you need to start programming in C\u002B\u002B and begin your programmation journey. Also, this course has been created to help you learn all the basics concepts that are the core of C\u002B\u002B programmation. This way, you will not only program in this language but you will also understand the logic behind this programming language and will be able to create various applications in it on your own. Indeed, if you don\u0027t have prior programming experience, the hardest part is understanding the programming logic and this course covers all the topics to help you succed in C\u002B\u002B programming.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, this course is built around a very simple but effective logic that is learning by practice. In other words, this course is definely not theoritical even if it contains some theoritical concepts. Indeed, this course is build on a logic of learning by practice. In other words, you will find various C\u002B\u002B exercices all over the course to help you master this programming language and achieve your end goal of learning how to program is C\u002B\u002B.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFor who is this course designed\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a lot of C\u002B\u002B course that exist all over the internet.

Also, each element that is presented in this course comes with a multitude of various programming examples that will alow you to practice everything that you will learn all over the course. In other words, if you never wrote a single line of code or did any programming prior this course and you always wanted to start somewhere then you will probably love this course. The way this course is presented and structured is here to help you achieve your obective of starting in the programming world and have a solid understanding of C\u002B\u002B programming by the end of this course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy should I take this course\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf programming in C\u002B\u002B is something that you always had a passion for and you always wanted to learn more about that programming language then you should definitely take this course. The first thing that this course will teach you is understanding the logic of programming or in other words how to think like a programmer and how to use with C\u002B\u002B.

The instructor challenged me to see myself through the eyes of my Lord and Savior - not the eyes of the world! I learned many valuable teachings about the Book of Philippians by taking this course. That is a credit to the instructor preparing a very detailed and organized course that is easy to follow. The course provided me the opportunity to reflect on my walk with the Lord, and my lack of commitment to thoroughly read and learn from God\u0027s written word on a daily basis. I will never find my true path (God\u0027s will for my life) if I remain a lukewarm Bible studying believer in the Lord, Jesus Christ! It is impossible for a born again Christian to seldom study the Bible, pray without ceasing or draw closer to God in a reconciled relationship while following the secular world. This course has reignited the fire that once was within me to learn from the Bible daily. I praise the Lord for Boomy Tokan who followed the Holy Spirit\u0027s prompting in preparing and sharing this course. I look forward to taking the other courses that Boomy has prepared.

It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables.
