Many times we resist it. We want things to stay the same. Especially when all is well. Health going well, Love life going well, Career going well, Children behaving NO CHANGE PLEASE! If that were only possible!?!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reality is that things do not stay the same, things are always changing. This is true with personal development, parenting, relationships and everything in life. Granted change happens at different rates, some so slow barely detectable yet things change. In the world of personal development, parenting \u0026amp; relationship development coming to grips with change and managing the change aka change management can be daunting. Reason is, that so much of the change is beyond our control. Yet we do have control over some of the change and we certainly have control of how we respond to change and how we manage change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother truth is that time and change are related. We see change based upon time and we measure change by time and vise versa. The time element can create issues for us. If change doesn\u2019t happen in the time we believe it should we can get frustrated and quit doing our part to direct change to our liking. In parenting this happens all the time. We may try a new way of addressing our children and if they don\u2019t respond as the \u201Cbook\u201D says then \u201Cour child\u201D must be the \u201Cexception to rule\u201D. So we quit. It didn\u0027t work. Why? Because we often see change as two steps, Old way and New way. But in truth there are six main steps connected by bridges with each step having a cycle of steps. There are changes within ourselves and with our children that will operate at different rates. So when we see Old way expecting new way to happen along with our expectations of when the new way should replace old way, we can feel as if change isn\u2019t happening. \u003Cstrong\u003EHowever, if we understand the method of change and its framework we could actually recognize change happening and where we are during the process of change. This gives us a measure of where we are on the journey of change. This shows us the progression of change. And that we are making an impact even when it appears ( especially in the beginning ) we are not. The recognition of our control of change gives us the confidence and will power to continue on the journey of directed change.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHelp Me I\u0027m a parent! : Method Change, Peaceful Management is designed to show you change, what it looks like, how the process is broken down so that you can see where you are in the process of change, so you wont quit, so you\u2019ll achieve the change you are looking for, sooner rather than later or never.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m Coach Hall your instructor for Help Me I\u0027m a parent! : Method Change, Peaceful Management.

This is basically an extensive project based course where you will learn step by step on how to build and design portfolio websites using Javascript and Three JS which is a Javascript library created and designed specifically for building 3D websites. In this course, you will extensively learn how to showcase your skill sets and qualifications to your future employers or clients by presenting them in the most compelling way possible. Not only that, you will also learn how to integrate a variety of 3D models to your portfolio website and make it even more interactive and eye-catching. In the introduction session, you will learn basic fundamentals of Three JS, such as getting to know its common use cases, main features, and exploring a few website examples built using Three JS. Then, you will continue by getting to know several 3D website ideas that you should consider to build. Afterward, since this course is going to be concentrating on teaching you to build a 3D portfolio website, you will learn several important aspects that you need to have in your portfolio website, for example like the about me section, detailed project description, portfolio showcase, and testimonials or reviews from your previous clients. Then, before starting the project, you will learn step by step on how to find and download 3D models from websites like Sketchfab and Clara IO since you will need them to be integrated to your portfolio website. Afterward, you will also be guided step by step on how to prepare your IDE and Javascript libraries. Once you\u2019ve learnt all necessary knowledge about Three JS, you will enter the main section of the course which is the project section where you will be guided step by step on how to build and design 3D portfolio websites using Three JS and you will spend most of your time here. Once the 3D portfolio website has been built, you will be conducting testing to make sure that the website has been fully functioning and the website has a high quality user interface. There will be four main testing objectives, those are functionality testing, user experience testing, performance testing, and compatibility testing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, we need to ask ourselves these questions: why should we learn how to build a portfolio website using Three JS? And what is the benefit of integrating 3D models to our website? Well, there are a lot of answers to those questions, firstly, the job market is getting more and more competitive, therefore, to get hired or to get clients, you will need to find the most effective strategy to be able to stand out from the crowds and the easiest way to do it is by being different in a positive way. Building a 3D portfolio website is one of many things you should consider as it will potentially set you apart from your other competitors. In addition to that, by presenting your projects in such a unique way, your future employers or clients will most likely be impressed with your portfolio website and it also increases your chance of getting hired very significantly as they see values that you have that other candidates do not have. Last but not least, learning how to build 3D websites using Javascript and Three JS is definitely a high demand skill set in the job market as it will enable you to build and design a lot of cool projects, such as virtual real estate, virtual classroom, 3D E-commerce marketplace, interactive map, and still many more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow are things that you can expect to learn from this course:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn basic fundamentals of Three JS, such as getting to know its common use cases, main features, and syntax\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGet to know several important aspects to have in portfolio website, such as about me section, project description, portfolio showcase, and reviews from previous clients\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to find and download 3D models from Sketchfab and Clara IO\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to initialize Vite JS package\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to create scene, camera, and renderer in Three JS\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to create 3D cube and cover each side with your photo\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to load 3D model and set the scale\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to rotate and animate 3D models\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to add ambient lighting and directional lighting\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to build a fully functioning 3D portfolio website with fully animated 3D backgrounds\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to add content to your HTML file\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to style your website with CSS\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to connect your button with your Github page\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConduct testing to make sure the website has been fully functioning.

\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd this is where the basic project comes in.\u0026nbsp; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0027re going to be using content that\u0027s already inside of after effects, not aftereffects, but Premiere \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPro, and we\u0027ll build out a sample project with that going over all of these tools and interfaces, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethen we\u0027ll talk about preferences. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo we\u0027ll cover all of these preferences right here and learn how we

project.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt won\u0027t be this project that you see here, but it will be a basic project with content that\u0027s already\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Einside of Not After Effects, but Premiere Pro.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, then we\u0027re going to get to the bread and butter of the course, which is production.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd what we\u0027re going to do is we\u0027re going to learn how to create a production.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd you can see here there\u0027s four projects in this production.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I close that production out, okay, and then I open up project number 24, that\u0027s going to open\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eup my other production, which has roughly about ten projects in there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd we\u0027re going to learn how to organize our projects inside of a production.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere basically what that is, is as you\u0027re putting multiple projects in one area, which in and premiere\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Epro, they call that a production which I think is a brilliant idea and a great tool for people that\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehave a lot of projects to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a simple way to organize your projects in one spot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd once we\u0027re done with all those projects, we\u0027re going to build 30 projects from scratch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd we\u0027re also going to utilize my website, which is learn tech project files dot com.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd

we\u0027ll do them individually.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s going to be a lot of fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027ll take a little bit of time, but it\u0027ll be a lot of fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo get excited about that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd once we do those 30 projects, then we\u0027ll wrap everything up with the summary and the
