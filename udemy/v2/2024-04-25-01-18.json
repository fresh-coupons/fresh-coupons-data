CSSLP is designed for software professionals engaged in the development, deployment, and maintenance of software systems. The certification aims to validate the candidates\u0027 expertise in integrating security measures throughout the entire software development lifecycle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe CSSLP certification is vendor-neutral, meaning it is not tied to any specific technology or software platform.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Certified Secure Software Lifecycle Professional (CSSLP) certification plays a vital role in elevating software security practices to a higher standard. With the ever-increasing frequency and complexity of cyber threats, having professionals skilled in identifying and mitigating security risks is essential for any organization that develops software.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEmbracing the CSSLP principles throughout the software development lifecycle not only enhances security but also builds trust among end-users and stakeholders, ultimately leading to the success of the software and the organization behind it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIn this master course I would like to teach the 8 major topics and 1 practice test:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

This course provides an in-depth overview of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). The EC2 service is an essential building block in becoming an AWS certified cloud practitioner. We will start with exploring key concepts relevant to EC2, followed by a hands-on practical guide to deploying compute resources on AWS. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe term \u201CScalable Cloud Computing\u201D has now become synonymous with Amazon Web Services. For nearly a decade, AWS has been powering some of the world\u2019s most popular websites and applications. Amazon EC2, is considered the computational backbone of AWS.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ETo illustrate how Amazon EC2 works, we explore the concept of virtualization. Virtualization is the process of creating a software-based virtual representation of a server. When we deploy an EC2 \u201CInstance\u201D we\u2019re creating a virtual representation of a physical server and it\u2019s resources.\u003Cstrong\u003E \u003C/strong\u003EThis includes: CPU, Memory (RAM), Storage, and network resources such as Bandwidth. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ESimilar to physical servers that you might find on-premises,\u003Cstrong\u003E \u003C/strong\u003Evirtual EC2 instances can also have different configurations. As a matter of fact, AWS offers the most comprehensive configuration options when it comes to deploying virtual servers.\u003Cstrong\u003E \u003C/strong\u003EThese configurations can easily be adapted to our resource needs, in real-time.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe level of customization a cloud provider can accommodate, will define the sophistication level of it\u2019s overall service. Not all cloud services were created equal. AWS, is known to have the highest level of configuration options when compared to just about any other service. The AWS platform caters to both micro and enterprise level clients, using one of the most scalable and advanced virtualization infrastructures available.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EBeyond the physical hardware customization and scalability, virtualization also accommodates the deployment of any operating system on the virtual machine. As you will see, we have the flexibility of deploying both Linux and Windows servers, using a variety of pre-configured virtual applications known as AMIs (Amazon Machine Images).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to a theoretical deep dive into Amazon EC2, this course will also provide you with practical hands-on experience in working with the key features of EC2.
