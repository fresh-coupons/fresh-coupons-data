It assumes that you\u0027re new to the language, so it gets you started with basic functionality such as creating functions, creating variables, and calling these lines of code from your standard HTML pages. It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E*\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E javascript course contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript introduction\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript array\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript variables\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript functions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript objects\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript control statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript cookies\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript loop statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript data structures\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript error handling\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript regular expressions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESection 4- python programming language.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis course section provides an introduction to programming and the python language. students are introduced to core python programming concepts like conditionals, loops, variables, and functions. this section includes an overview of the various python aspects.

One of the reasons why my weight loss program is ideal for most people is that it leans heavily on using the natural body movements with long-term approaches to achieve results. It does not promise you a 1-week result without any effort. But it is perfect for those who have not done much for so many years and want to start. Plus those who have gone through the yo-yo periods of dieting and weight loss programs will also find it useful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E________________________________________________________________________\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EWhat is the proof that it has worked?\u003C/em\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEverything I have spoken to people who have lost weight and continue to maintain their weight I have been fascinated by how they all seem to enjoy the process, look great and confident they can continue. Whenever I have asked how they have arrived at their ideal weight and attitude the response has always been the same; it take long term consistent effort. Here lies one of the big secrets. We used to think some were either born to look trim whiles other were born to be overweight but the truth is that anyone can change the way they look by consistent, action towards a goal. Sooner or later you will get there. Hence, the program detailed in the course is to help you achieve the weight they want by starting with a small habit that will propel you towards the destination you want! That is what has helped me to lose weight nad continue to help me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B\u002B\u002B\u002B\u002B\u002B\u002B\u002B\u002B\u002B\u002B\u002B\u002B\u002B\u002B\u002B\u002B\u002B\u002B\u002B\u002B\u002B\u002B\u002B\u002B\u002B\u002B\u002B\u002B\u002B\u002B\u002B\u002B\u002B\u002B\u002B\u002B\u002B\u002B\u002B\u002B\u002B\u002B\u002B\u002B\u002B\u002B\u002B\u002B\u002B\u002B\u002B\u002B\u002B\u002B\u002B\u002B\u002B\u002B\u002B\u002B\u002B\u002B\u002B\u002B\u002B\u002B\u002B\u002B\u002B\u002B\u002B\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E So what is required:\u003C/strong\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt doesn\u2019t require you to be very fit when you start because the program is tailored to help you wherever you are starting from.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt doesn\u2019t require to know the right techniques.
