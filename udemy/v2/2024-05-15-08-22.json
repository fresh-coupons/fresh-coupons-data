He published\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehis results, but their significance was not realized in hislifetime. Several years after his death, however, re-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esearchers realized that Mendel had discovered fundamental principles of heredity\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe structure of DNA was first described in 1953, andsince that time genetics has become one of the most excit-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eing and ground-breaking sciences. Our understanding ofgene structure and function has progressed rapidly since\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emolecular techniques were developed to clone or amplifygenes, and rapid methods for sequencing DNA became\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eavailable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EResearch in genetics underwent a revolution in 1972,when Paul Berg constructed the first recombinant DNA\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emolecule in vitro, and in 1973, when Herbert Boyer andStanley Cohen cloned a recombinant DNA molecule for\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe first time. The development by Kary Mullis in 1986of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Especific segments of DNA spawned another revolution.Recombinant DNA technology, PCR, and other molecular\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etechnologies are leading to an ever-increasing number ofexciting discoveries that are furthering our knowledge of\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebasic biological functions and will lead to improvementsin the quality of human life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E In recent years, the sequencing of the genomes ofa large number of viruses and organisms has changed thescope of experiments performed by geneticists.

It was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994. The PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group. PHP originally stood for \u003Cem\u003EPersonal Home Page\u003C/em\u003E, but it now stands for the recursive initialism \u003Cem\u003EPHP: Hypertext Preprocessor\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPHP code is usually processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module, a daemon, or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. On a web server, the result of the interpreted and executed PHP code \u2013 which may be any type of data, such as generated HTML or binary image data \u2013 would form the whole or part of an HTTP response. Various web template systems, web content management systems, and web frameworks exist which can be employed to orchestrate or facilitate the generation of that response. Additionally, PHP can be used for many programming tasks outside of the web context, such as standalone graphical applications and robotic drone control. Arbitrary PHP code can also be interpreted and executed via a command-line interface (CLI).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe standard PHP interpreter, powered by the Zend Engine, is free software released under the PHP License. PHP has been widely ported and can be deployed on most web servers on almost every operating system and platform, free of charge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe PHP language evolved without a written formal specification or standard until 2014, with the original implementation acting as the \u003Cem\u003Ede facto\u003C/em\u003E standard which other implementations aimed to follow. Since 2014, work has gone on to create a formal PHP specification.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs of January 2021, 72% of PHP websites use discontinued versions of PHP, i.e. PHP 7.2 or lower, which are no longer supported by The PHP Development Team. A large additional fraction uses PHP 7.3, which is only (up to December 6, 2021) \u0022supported for critical security issues only.\u0022 Over 40% of all PHP websites use version 5.6 or older, which not even Debian supports (Debian 9 supported version 7.0 and 7.1).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBeginner Friendliness\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEasy to Get Started With\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPHP was designed to make web development easier, and many beginners find it effortless to pick up and get started with. In fact, PHP code was so easy to pick up, many non-programmers end up being able to hack PHP code together without truly understanding the code. While good programmers will never copy and paste code they don\u0027t understand, this speaks volumes about how easy it is to pick up PHP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe latest version of PHP (PHP8) has fixed a lot of inconsistencies and fatal errors as well.

While biologists have made great strides in discovering things on Earth, there are still many new things to learn. The first fundamental questions are: What is Life? What does it mean to have life? These inquiries are essential to the discoveries that biologists find every day. With such a vast scope of information, biologists must organize these discoveries that will stand the test of time.

It incorporates biology, physics, chemistry, and other academic disciplines. Life is multidisciplinary and is driven by chemical processes. Since so many biology topics overlap with basic principles of chemistry, you need a basic understanding and appreciation of chemistry to fully understand biology. For example, in Unit 1, we discussed that the atom is the first part of the biological hierarchy. In this unit, we provide an understanding of this foundational level of organization.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBiological Molecules\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBiological molecules are the essential molecules needed for life. These molecules can be organic or inorganic. Organic chemistry is the study of carbon, which is an element that forms strong covalent bonds essential for the foundational structures of all living things. Water, salts, acids, and bases are mostly essential inorganic molecules that facilitate many biological processes. All organisms contain organic biological molecules \u2013 carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and nucleic acid \u2013 that are essential to life.

In this unit, we explore the characteristics, components, and functions of cells. Learning about the structures of cells allows us to see the similarities and differences among organisms. Bacteria, plant, animal, and fungus cells are similar in many ways and contain many of the same small structures known as organelles. However, some characteristics help distinguish whether a cell belongs to an animal, plant, fungus, or bacteria. For example, all plant cells contain cell walls, while animal cells lack this particular extracellular structure.

Where does all that biomass come from? How does it get the energy to grow? Photosynthesis is the fascinating process plants use to convert light energy to chemical energy. Because plants are at the bottom of the food pyramid in almost all ecological systems, understanding how they grow and develop will give you a greater understanding of your environment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003ECellular Reproduction: Mitosis\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrganisms require their cells to divide for the purposes of reproduction, growth, development, or repair. Cellular division is divided into two phases: mitosis and cytokinesis. Mitosis involves the division of the nuclear chromosomes, while cytokinesis is the division of the cytoplasmic components into new daughter cells. Serious consequences, such as cancer, can occur if this cell cycle is disrupted in some way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003ECellular Reproduction: Meiosis\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeiosis is a specialized type of cellular reproduction that only occurs in the ovaries and testes and results in an egg or sperm, respectively.
