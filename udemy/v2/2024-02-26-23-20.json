The Google Ads platform focuses on Pay Per Click (PPC) ads, where advertisers pay per impression on an ad.

To run a business at optimal capacity, you need to reduce or eliminate waste from processes and improve production flow. In this course, you\u0027ll learn about Lean strategies to reduce waste by determining which operations add value and which don\u0027t. You\u0027ll explore the concept of continuous flow, and discover how to balance work processes to make production flow more efficient. You\u0027ll define what waste is, where it exists, and what causes it.

And in any business, one of the heaviest drains on profitability is waste. Lean waste can come in the form of time, material, and labor. But it may also be related to the utilization of skill-sets as well as poor planning. In lean manufacturing, waste is any expense or effort that is expended but which does not transform raw materials into an item the customer is willing to pay for. By optimizing process steps and eliminating waste, the only true value is added at each phase of production.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday, the Lean Manufacturing model recognizes 8 types of waste within an operation; seven originally conceived when the Toyota Production System was first conceived, and an eighth added when the lean methodology was adopted within the Western World.
