This course is a comprehensive project based course where you will be fully guided step by step on how to build metaverse projects without having to write a single line of code. In the introduction session, you will be introduced to the basic fundamentals of metaverse, technologies behind metaverse, as well as some metaverse project ideas to build. Then, once you got into the project, you will extensively learn how to utilise three metaverse builder tools, the first one is Blockade Labs which is text to metaverse AI generator where you will be able to input text prompts and Blockade Labs will be able to generate you a 3D metaverse virtual reality space based on the given prompt. So, it is extremely similar to Midjourney or Stable Diffusion, the only difference here is Blockade Labs generates a 3D metaverse space instead of arts or images. Meanwhile, the second one is Metaverses IO which is no code builder platform where you can easily customise free metaverse template to build your own space, you will be guided step by step on how to use all features available on this platform as well as building and designing several interesting metaverse projects to make yourself more familiar with this tool. Lastly, the third metaverse builder tool that you will learn is Spatial IO which is actually pretty similar to Metaverse IO when it comes to features and functionalities, but Spatial IO concentrates more on virtual space design. Once all the metaverse projects have been built, we will continue by conducting testing to make sure the metaverse is comfortable to be used, easy to navigate from the perspectives of the user. Last but not least, the course will be ended by sharing several strategies that can be implemented to potentially monetise metaverse as well as some metaverse based business models you can consider to start.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, before getting into the course, we need to ask ourselves these questions: why should we learn about the metaverse? Why should we build a metaverse? I don\u2019t know about you but to me, it really seems that we are slowly moving and transforming into that direction as more and more companies starting to implement work from home policy, more and more schools, colleges, universities starting to offer online classes, and in overall, like it or not, the time we spend online in most cases is way longer compared to the time we spend offline. Therefore, by knowing and understanding how to build a metaverse, you will not only get a high demand skill set in today\u2019s economy but also you will be able to innovate your own product to fill the gap in the market. In addition to that, oftentimes people see metaverse as the main product, even though it is actually not, metaverse is simply just a platform or place to be on, just like social media, and let the people inside do what they want to do there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow are things you can expect to learn from this course:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn the basic fundamentals of metaverse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn the technologies behind metaverse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to use Blockade Labs and Skybox AI to generate metaverse background from text prompt\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to use Metaverses IO to build and customise a metaverse template\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to use Spatial IO to build metaverse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to customise avatar on Spatial IO\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to build a metaverse cinema\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to build a metaverse art gallery\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to add 3D objects to the metaverse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn several different ways to monetise metaverse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/metaverse-architect-building-virtual-space-with-no-code/","imageUri":"https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5361398_a6cd_2.jpg","duration":"2.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"55.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["People who are interested in building metaverse without code","People who are interested in creating virtual space to to hold virtual events"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":0,"averageValue":"0.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"Christ Raharja","url":"/user/christ-raharja/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":0}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"11B086051707D05EDBA7","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-es6-for-react-js/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":3046128,"title":"Modern JavaScript for React JS - ES6 [2023]","shortDescription":"A complete guide for beginners to learn the essential topics of ES6 which are required to learn React JS","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EAre you looking to extend your knowledge in Javascript programming by learning the concepts of modern javascript - ES6?\u003Cbr\u003EIf you want to start your journey to become a React or Angular developer, then this is the perfect course for you. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat\u0027s this course about?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThis course is specifically designed for those who want to get a quick start with Modern Javascript, especially ES6 concepts.

Fear and stress hormones are released throughout their body. These hormones remain in the flesh of the slaughtered animal and are eaten by unsuspecting people.

Gradually awareness is withdrawn to one\u2019s \u201Cinner space\u201D to the sounds within the body (heartbeat, blood circulation, etc.).

One cannot learn to meditate, just as we cannot \u201Clearn\u201D to sleep. Sleep just happens when our body becomes relaxed and quiet. Meditation happens when the mind is quiet. In meditation there is no imagination, because imagination arises from the intellect. We can compare the human brain to a powerful computer that has enormous storage capacity. All the data of the Universe may be stored there, but this \u201Ccomputer\u201D is also limited. Our human brain can only reproduce what has been fed into it. But in meditation, we experience pure being.

The knower (i.e. the person practicing), knowledge (i.e. what is God) and the object of knowledge (i.e. God) become one. This means that one unites with the Divine consciousness. Those who attain Samadhi see a heavenly, radiant light, hear a heavenly sound and feel within themselves an infinite expanse. When Samadhi is attained, we are like a river that finally flows into the sea after a long and difficult journey. All obstacles are overcome and the river is, for all of time, united with the ocean. In the same way, a Yogi arrives at the end of the path and becomes one with the Supreme Consciousness. The Yogi\u0027s consciousness finds eternal quiet, peace and bliss - the Yogi is liberated.

Political sociology deals with the relationship between state and society on the basis of mutual interaction and with power as the ultimate aim.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe course is provided both in the form of part-time as well as on correspondence basis. Political sociology is concerned with the sociological analysis of political phenomena ranging from the State and civil society to the family, investigating topics such as citizenship, social movements, and the sources of social power. Traditionally, there were four main areas of research.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. The sociopolitical formation of the modern state\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. How social inequality between groups (class, race, gender) influences politics\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. How public opinion, ideologies, personalities, social movements, and trends outside of the formal institutions of political power affect formal politics\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Power relationships within and between social groups (e.g. families, workplaces, bureaucracy, media)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPolitical sociology is concerned with the sociological analysis of political phenomena ranging from the State and civil society to the family, investigating topics such as citizenship, social movements, and the sources of social power. The lineage of this discipline is typically traced from such thinkers as Montesquieu, Smith and Ferguson through the founding fathers of sociology \u2013 Karl Marx, Emile Durkheim and Max Weber \u2013 to such contemporary theorists as Anthony Giddens, Jurgen Habermas and Michael Mann. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn other words, political sociology was traditionally concerned with how social trends, dynamics, and structures of domination affect formal political processes, as well as exploring how various social forces work together to change political policies. From this perspective, we can identify three major theoretical frameworks: pluralism, elite or managerial theory, and class analysis, which overlaps with Marxist analysis. Pluralism sees politics primarily as a contest among competing interest groups. Elite or managerial theory is sometimes called a state-centered approach. It explains what the state does by looking at constraints from organizational structure, semi-autonomous state managers, and interests that arise from the state as a unique, power-concentrating organization. A leading representative is Theda Skocpol. Social class theory analysis emphasizes the political power of capitalist elites. It can be split into two parts: one is the \u0022power structure\u0022 or \u0022instrumentalist\u0022 approach, whereas another is the structuralist approach. The power structure approach focuses on the question of who rules and its most well-known representative is G.

A shell is the interactive prompt that appears when Linux boots up. It\u0027s also where users can enter commands to manage their systems.

They can automate tasks, inspect and modify the system, and much more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBash enables Linux administrators to perform complex tasks quickly and easily. For example, network configuration files can be edited with ease using a text editor. Then those edits can be saved as a shell script for further modification or backup purposes. Bash also makes it easy to check system resources such as memory and storage space. Plus, it can be used for automated system maintenance such as stopping services, removing unwanted files.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBash scripting makes it easy to keep your Linux system secure and up-to-date with security patches and software updates. Most of these updates involve fixing bugs or adding new features to the system\u0027s core applications and libraries. Administrators can run scheduled updates and check for problems along the way via a cron job or other program tools. In addition, all security patches are automatically applied via automated scripts without any user intervention required. As a result, your system stays secure regardless of who\u0027s handling your server\u0027s update process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBash is an essential part of any professional Linux environment management strategy.
