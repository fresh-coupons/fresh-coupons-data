It provides you the ability to organize, edit and manage your photos like no other software. The Lightroom tutorials start off explaining what Lightroom is, what catalogs are and how many you should consider having.

But read on to find out why we can be confident in making it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESo just what is eCommerce?\u003C/strong\u003E Of course, the term refers to online commerce: i.e. selling products online.\u003Cbr\u003EBut while eCommerce could mean selling an eBook from a landing page, it is most often used to refer more exclusively to online shops that sell multiple products and that have a particular layout and set-up. The most popular example of an \u003Cstrong\u003EeCommerce store \u003C/strong\u003Eis undoubtedly Amazon. This acts just like a high street store and allows you to browse products at your leisure and add them to a shopping cart. The only difference is that you can do all this from the comfort of your home and once you check out, the products are the simply delivered to you wherever you are.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIt\u2019s a familiar concept, but what makes it so important?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy eCommerce is the Future\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E#1 eCommerce is Growing\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/strong\u003EThe first thing you need to recognize is that eCommerce is growing. In the early days, people were uncertain about spending money online and found that it was daunting handing over their card details and trusting in a supplier that they couldn\u2019t meet face to face.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EBut now look at companies like Amazon and eBay. These are household names around the world and everyone from the young and tech savvy to the elderly are now happy to shop with them. These companies have helped many people to put aside any concerns they might have had regarding eCommerce and to trust in buying online.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAnd eCommerce is growing as well doing massive business.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EFor proof, you need look no further than stats from \u2018Cyber Monday\u2019. Cyber Monday is a national holiday of sorts where online retailers are anticipated to lower their prices. It follows Black Friday but these days it tends to do nearly as much business \u2013 and it\u2019s growing rapidly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EFor example, in 2014 Cyber Monday created a total of $2.59 billion sales online. That\u2019s no small number but in 2015 this was increased to $3.19 billion. That\u2019s a huge increase. $2.28 billion of these were on desktop (versus $2.04 billion last year) while $838 million were through mobile devices (versus $548 million).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAcross all devices, Cyber Monday increased by 21%!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ESeeing as Amazon is probably the best known online retailer, how is its growth going? Well, the company sold a total of $107.01 billion worth of products in 2015. The company employees 230,800 and there are 304 million active Amazon customer accounts. The brand is worth $47.73 billion and this is only expected to continue to grow as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe story is the same across the board. People are becoming more and more familiar with eCommerce and high-street stores are struggling. This is undoubtedly the future of selling and it\u2019s easy to see why.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E#2 It\u2019s Convenient\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/strong\u003ESo what is it that has led to such growth in eCommerce? Well, the simple fact of the matter is that online sales benefit everyone. The only reason online sales haven\u2019t already dwarfed physical sales is probably the fact that some people still don\u2019t trust shopping online or aren\u2019t sure how to go about it. Over time this concern will be eroded more and more \u2013 while tools like PayPal will make it easier and safer than ever before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWhen you sell products online, it means that you don\u2019t have to employ staff and you don\u2019t have to rent the same amount of physical space. You\u2019ll need somewhere to store your products (unless you\u2019re drop shipping) but other than that, your only costs will be hosting, shipping and web design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ELower overheads mean more profit for you but they also mean lower prices for customers. Customers now have the ability to order products online conveniently but on top of that, they\u2019ll be getting them for a much lower price.\u003Cbr\u003EThere\u2019s also greater versatility in terms of what you can sell. With an eCommerce store you can sell physical products which will require some up-front investment. But\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThere\u2019s also a lot less up-front cost. If you wanted to set up a high-street store, then you would need to be willing to spend a large amount of money to rent the physical space, to invest in the stock and to manage staff etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EHowever, if you are setting up an online store then all you\u2019re going to need is some inventory to sell (perhaps not if you are going to be selling digital products or acting as an affiliate) and a website. It takes just a few clicks to set up an eCommerce store and that means you can have one up and running in minutes for a negligible cost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E#3 It\u2019s the Best Way to Monetize a Website\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/strong\u003EThe last two examples explain why businesses should launch their own eCommerce stores and why you might consider launching an eCommerce store as your business. But you should also sit up and take notice if you run a blog or website already and you\u2019re just looking for a way to monetize it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWhy? Because it\u2019s actually one of the most effective methods there is of making money from an eCommerce website.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EUntil now, you likely have been relying on one of several methods to make money online. Perhaps you\u2019re making ads from advertising on your website (Google AdSense for example) or maybe you\u2019re making money by selling an affiliate product.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn either of those scenarios, it\u2019s important to recognize that you have placed yourself at the bottom of the \u2018foodchain\u2019. In other words, you\u2019re being paid by those advertisers and\u0026nbsp;product creators in order to send business their way. The fact that they\u2019re happy to continue paying you, means that they\u2019re making more money that that from you. In other words, they\u2019re earning more from your visitors than you are! You\u2019re getting a small share of their profit but they\u2019re taking home the lion\u2019s share. And in fact, you\u2019re essentially doing their work for them!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAnd that\u2019s why you\u2019ll typically earn about 1-50 cents per click on an advert. Meaning in turn that you\u2019re going to need hundreds of thousands of visitors to your site a day to make any reasonable money. Compare this with selling your own products and making $20-50 each time. Of course, it\u2019s much easier to get someone to click on an advert than it is to get them to buy something \u2013 but not as much easier as you think if you have decent products and you\u2019re running your store well. The bottom line? You can make a living from a website with just a few hundred daily visitors instead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIf you have an eCommerce website, then the buck stops with you. Now you\u2019re making the maximum profit from your customers because you\u2019re selling something to them and keeping the difference. What\u2019s more, is that you\u2019re keeping your visitors on your eCommerce website and engaged with your brand. You\u2019re not sending them away, you\u2019re keeping them right where you want them and making a real difference to the way they see you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EFinally, selling eCommerce products is better than selling digital products or affiliate products because it\u2019s something that anyone can appreciate. Only a very specific type of person buys eBooks about making money online. Phone cases and clothes though? That has a much broader appeal!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ETry putting an eCommerce website on your existing website and just see what a difference it makes to your profits.
