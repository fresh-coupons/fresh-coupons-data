Stacks use the \u0022last in, first out\u0022 (LIFO) principle, while queues use the \u0022first in, first out\u0022 (FIFO) principle. These data structures are useful for managing data in a specific order, and we will learn how to implement and use them in our class.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrees are another popular data structure that we will cover in our class. Trees are useful for organizing data in a hierarchical structure and are often used in computer science applications like file systems, databases, and search engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to data structures, we will also cover the basics of OOP in C\u002B\u002B.

Engine controls, electronic suspension systems, and anti-lock brakes are common on today\u2019s vehicles. Even electrical systems that were once thought of as being simple have evolved to computer controls. Headlights are now pulse-width modulated using high side drivers and will automatically brighten and dim based on the light intensity of oncoming traffic. Today\u2019s vehicles are equipped with twenty or more computers, laser-guided cruise control, sonar park assist, infrared climate control, fiber optics, and radio frequency transponders and decoders. Simple systems have become more computers reliant. For example, the horn circuit on the 2008 Chrysler 300C involves three separate control modules to function.

To get a better idea of the possible demand for used cars in your area, you\u2019ll need to crunch some numbers. By knowing the number of used cars sold in your area every year and month , you can estimate what percentage of the market you will be likely to be able to corner and reach. By locating the average profit per vehicle, you can get an approximate idea of how much profit and money your dealership able to make per year. While the groundwork associated with opening a dealership can be time-consuming, expensive, and demanding, the real test of your dealership\u2019s viability doesn\u2019t begin until after you open your doors to the public. Without the right management of your dealership, all the effort you put into laying the foundation will be wasted. While each state has its own rules and regulations, there are several important universal aspects of operating a car dealership and tips on how you can get the most out of your investment. Your customers are the single most important factor in the success or failure of your business, so taking the time to identify who they are and what they care about is absolutely vital. Take a look at the types of cars you plan on selling, then do some research to determine the age, gender, and income level of the average individual who owns those types of vehicles. Later down the line, this will allow you to tailor your marketing and advertising efforts toward those who are most likely to be interested in what you have to offer.

The term digital forensics was originally used as a synonym for \u003Cstrong\u003Ecomputer forensics\u003C/strong\u003E but has expanded to cover investigation of all devices capable of storing digital data. With roots in the personal computing revolution of the late 1970s and early 1980s, the discipline evolved in a haphazard manner during the 1990s, and it was not until the early 21st century that national policies emerged.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDigital forensics investigations have a variety of applications. The most common is to support or refute a hypothesis before criminal or civil courts. Criminal cases involve the alleged breaking of laws that are defined by legislation and that are enforced by the police and prosecuted by the state, such as theft and assault against the person. Civil cases on the other hand deal with protecting the rights and property of individuals (often associated with family disputes) but may also be concerned with contractual disputes between commercial entities where a form of digital forensics referred to as electronic discovery (discovery) may be involved\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring the 1980s very few specialized digital forensic tools existed, and consequently investigators often performed live analysis on media, examining computers from within the operating system using existing sysadmin tools to extract evidence. This practice carried the risk of modifying data on the disk, either inadvertently or otherwise, which led to claims of evidence tampering. A number of tools were created during the early 1990s to address the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDigital forensics is commonly used in both criminal law and private investigation. Traditionally it has been associated with criminal law, where evidence is collected to support or oppose a hypothesis before the courts. As with other areas of forensics this is often a part of a wider investigation spanning a number of disciplines.

Kotlin has classes with constructors, along with nested, inner, and anonymous inner classes, and it has interfaces like Java 8. Kotlin does \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E have a new keyword. To create a class instance, call the constructor just like a regular function. We saw that in the screenshot above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKotlin has single inheritance from a named superclass, and all Kotlin classes have a default superclass Any, which is \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E the same as the Java base class java.lang.Object. Any contains only three predefined member functions: equals(), hashCode(), and toString().\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKotlin classes have to be marked with the open keyword in order to allow other classes to inherit from them; Java classes are kind of the opposite, as they are inheritable \u003Cem\u003Eunless\u003C/em\u003E marked with the final keyword. To override a superclass method, the method itself must be marked open, and the subclass method must be marked override. This is all of a piece with Kotlin\u2019s philosophy of making things explicit rather than relying on defaults. In this particular case, I can see where Kotlin\u2019s way of explicitly marking base class members as open for inheritance and derived class members as overrides avoids several kinds of common Java errors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, you\u0027ll learn how to create apps and run them on virtual devices through guided exercises. You\u0027ll cover the fundamentals of Android development, from structuring an app to building out the UI with Activities and Fragments and various navigation patterns. Progressing through the chapters and lectures, you\u0027ll delve into Android\u0027s RecyclerView to make the most of displaying lists of data and become comfortable with fetching data from a web service and handling images. You\u0027ll then learn about mapping, location services, and the permissions model before working with notifications and how to persist data. Moving on, you\u0027ll get to grips with testing, covering the full spectrum of the test pyramid. You\u0027ll also learn how AAC (Android Architecture Components) are used to cleanly structure your code and explore various architecture patterns and the benefits of dependency injection. \u003Cem\u003EThe core libraries of RxJava and Coroutines are covered for asynchronous programming\u003C/em\u003E. The focus then returns to the UI, demonstrating how to add motion and transitions when users interact with your apps. Towards the end, you\u0027ll build an interesting app to retrieve and display popular movies from a movie database, and then see how to publish your apps on Google Play. By the end of this course, you\u0027ll have the skills and confidence needed to build fully-fledged Android apps using Kotlin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre you trying to start a career in Android programming, but haven\u0027t found the right way in? Do you have a great idea for an app, but don\u0027t know how to make it a reality? Or maybe you\u0027re just frustrated that to learn Android, you must already know Kotlin. If so, then this course is for you\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen Android first arrived in 2008, it was a bit drab compared to the much more stylish iOS on the Apple iPhone/iPad. But, quite quickly, through a variety of handset offers that struck a chord with practical, price-conscious consumers, as well as those who are fashion-conscious and tech-savvy, Android user numbers exploded. For many, myself included, developing for Android is the most rewarding pastime and business, bar none. Quickly putting together a prototype of an idea, refining it, and then deciding to run with it and wire it up into a fully-fledged app, is such an exciting and rewarding process. Any programming can be fun \u2013 I have been programming all my life \u2013 but creating for Android is somehow extraordinarily rewarding..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKotlin is the most succinct language, and therefore is the least error-prone, \u003Cem\u003Ewhich is great for beginners\u003C/em\u003E. Kotlin is also the most fun language, mainly because the succinctness means you can get results faster and with less code. Google considers Kotlin an official (first-class) Android language. There are some other advantages to Kotlin that make it less error-prone and less likely to make mistakes that cause crashes. We will discover the details of these advantages as we proceed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKotlin is an object-oriented language. This means that it uses the concept of reusable programming objects. If this sounds like technical jargon, another analogy will help. Kotlin enables us and others (like the Android API development team) to write code that can be structured based on real-world things, and here is the important part \u2013 it can be reused.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/kotlin-android-training-android-app-development/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4365954_c92d_6.jpg","duration":"15.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"63,104.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Beginner Kotlin Developers","Android Kotlin Programming Training","Mobile App Development Course"],"tags":["Android Development","Kotlin"],"rating":{"count":348,"averageValue":"3.7"},"instructors":[{"name":"OCSALY Academy | 260.000\u002B Students","url":"/user/online-academy-of-computer-science/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":3.9555554}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"OCSALY_YOUTUBE_100K","originalPrice":"\u20B91,999","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/computer-forensics-beginner-to-advanced-cfct-masterclass/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4594072,"title":"The Complete Computer Forensics Course for 2023 PRO : CFCT\u002B","shortDescription":"Start Computer Forensics Career now and see your Growth step by step and Unlock your potential.

Digital cameras\u003Cstrong\u003E \u003C/strong\u003Eare built into doorbells; your smartphone tracks your daily movements from work to home and back; and you receive social media updates when you go to the gym, see a show, or visit a new city.

There is almost no criminal activity that does not involve digital evidence, and it is your responsibility as an investigator to gather all available evidence, process it, and present your findings to the authorities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInvestigators who work in the field of digital forensics must have a diverse set of skills and interests. The first question I ask anyone thinking about a career in this field is if they enjoy solving puzzles. You may not have access to any information other than the fact that something happened when investigating a case. So, if someone needs to be shown or told what happened, this field may not be right for them. When a case is brought to an investigator\u0027s attention, the investigator is often given instructions to figure out what the computer or device was used for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother important trait is the ability to deal with frustration, as investigative tools and software do not always work without problems. When it comes to cell phones and small devices, this is a fairly common occurrence. Many students, rather than working through the challenges, stop their investigation in class at the first sign of difficulty. They don\u0027t even try to figure out what\u0027s wrong with the tool by looking at the web or using the help system. To be a successful investigator, one must be persistent and creative \u2013 they must be problem solvers. Digital forensics is a branch of forensic science that collects, analyses, documents, and presents digital evidence related to computer crime for use in a court of law using scientific knowledge. Knowing what was done, when it was done, and who did it is the ultimate goal. The term \u201Cdigital forensics\u201D is often used interchangeably with \u201Ccomputer forensics\u201D (also known as \u201Ccyber forensics\u201D), but it has come to encompass all devices capable of storing digital data, including networking devices, mobile phones, tablets, digital cameras, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, digital home appliances, and other digital storage media such as CD/DVD, USB drives, SD cards, external drives, and backup tapes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComputer Forensics is a specialization that deals with the recovery, examination and investigation of digital evidence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComputer Forensics is an applied science that deals with the recovery, examination and investigation of digital evidence.

The goal of computer forensics is to perform a structured investigation and maintain a documented chain of evidence to find out exactly what happened on a computing device and who was responsible for it. Computer forensics -- which is sometimes referred to as computer forensic science essentially is data recovery with legal compliance guidelines to make the information admissible in legal proceedings. The terms digital forensics and cyber forensics are often used as synonyms for computer forensics. Digital forensics starts with the collection of information in a way that maintains its integrity. Investigators then analyze the data or system to determine if it was changed, how it was changed and who made the changes. The use of computer forensics isn\u0027t always tied to a crime.

I wanted to learn, not only what a media trainer does, but also what steps I would have to take in order to become a successful media trainer--TJ discusses all this in a clear and concise manner, in a tone that is welcoming and never alienating. The only constructive critique I would give would be concerning the technical form of the presentation, more specifically the video quality and picture aesthetic. Going by the current standard as it applies to video, everything we view is in high definition. Having said that, I believe the video quality could be improved upon as well as the backdrop which I found to be a bit generic and outdated. I found these minor flaws to be slightly distracting and given the high caliber of the speaker and the information being presented I believe these aspects detracted, if only marginally, from the quality of the product.\u0022\u0026nbsp;\u003C/em\u003ENick Cisik\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u00225 Stars!

We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables.
