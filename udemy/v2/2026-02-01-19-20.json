Prepare for CKA/CKAD Exam","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EJust like how real world shipping containers revolutionised the way goods are packaged, handled and transported across the globe\u00A0\u00A0industry,\u00A0Docker along with\u00A0open container ecosystem is transforming the software delivery by brining in the standardisation.\u00A0 Docker offers a way to run isolated processes and also allows one to package an application along with its run time environment using primitives such as dockerfiles.\u00A0 However, when it comes to running docker in a production like environment, with container work loads\u00A0\u00A0spanning across more than one nodes,\u00A0 you need a COE (\u00A0Container Orchestration Engine). COEs offer clustering and convert your nodes into one super computer, make intelligent\u00A0\u00A0decisions as to where to schedule the containers, connect containers running on different nodes by setting up multi host network and offer many other interesting features such as fault tolerance, zero downtime deployments etc.\u00A0\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKubernetes is the gold standard in the world of container orchestration. It was originally created by Google, based on their experience of building and managing containers at scale ( at Google Scale). However its now driven by Cloud Native Compute Foundation ( CNCF), an open body, which also offers the official certification i.e. \u0022\u003Cstrong\u003EKubernetes Certified Administrator\u003C/strong\u003E\u0022.\u00A0 Kubernetes comes with mind boggling features, is very reliable, and extremely sophisticated container orchestration engine. It can let you convert your infrastructure into a Container as a Service (Platform),\u00A0 brining in some of the awe inspiring features such as Zero Down Time Deployments, Fault Tolerance, Auto Scaling, Cloud and Storage integrations, which were extremely difficult to implement.\u00A0 And it brings it to the masses with its truly\u00A0open, lock in free\u00A0eco system.\u00A0\u00A0\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith Kubernetes\u0027 sophistication however, comes the complexity too. Even though I have been using Kubernetes for more than 2 years now, almost every month, I\u00A0find something new about kubernetes, something really cool, be it cloud integrations, or the newly introduced RBAC, be it dynamic storage provisioning, or stateful sets, its a fascinating world once you start exploring it. However, you would definitely need a guide once you while you navigate the complex world of Kubernetes, and this course serves just that. its been created in a way that you start learning kubernetes fround grounds up, one small step at a time, feature by feature.\u00A0\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis course\u00A0brings to you a distilled experience with my knowledge of building and managing infrastructures, experience of helping companies with their devops journey and more than 300 corporate trainings. This is a well researched program and I\u00A0have tried many variants of applications, with different flows, took feedback, and iterated many times. Thats one of the reasons why it took us more than 4 months to even launch the course in its first form.\u00A0 We\u00A0have also started incorporating some new and useful techniques including glassboard, mindmaps to explain the concepts better and make things easier. I\u00A0and my team wants to make this program the best in the world, and are constantly working towards it.\u00A0\u00A0\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHere is what this course would cover, one step at a time,\u00A0\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EIntroduction to Kubernetes and the key concepts\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ESetting up learning Environment\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EPods\u00A0\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EReplication Controllers and Replica Sets\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EDeployments\u00A0\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EServices\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EConfigMaps and Secrets\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EPersistent Storage\u00A0 \n\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur next version would include many additional topics including,\u00A0\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ERelease Strategies\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EHorizontal Pod Autoscaler\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EHelm Package Manager\u00A0\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ERBAC\u00A0\n\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EIngress Controllers\u00A0\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ECI/CD with Kubernetes\u00A0\u00A0\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen you sign up for this course now, you are guaranteed to receive these updates, that our promise to you !\u00A0 We wish you all the best while learning Kubernetes !!\u00A0\u00A0\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/kubernetes-certified-administrator/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/1271904_e382_7.jpg","duration":"23.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"27,072.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Developers who would like to deploy their applications with containers and like to understand how to leverage Kubernetes features","Operations or devops folks who would like to build Container as a Service and/or  Operate it","Anyone who would like to understand Kubernetes from grounds up","Anyone who wants to run containers in Production or Production Like Environments","Anyone who wants to appear for Kubernetes Certified Administrator Exam from CNCF"],"tags":["Docker","Kubernetes","Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA)"],"rating":{"count":1211,"averageValue":"4.6"},"instructors":[{"name":"Gourav J.
