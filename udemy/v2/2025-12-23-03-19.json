In today\u2019s digital age, kids are already surrounded by \u003Cstrong\u003EAI in games, smart devices, and everyday apps\u003C/strong\u003E, but very few understand how it actually works. This course transforms curiosity into knowledge by teaching kids, in simple and enjoyable ways, how \u003Cstrong\u003Esmart computers, robots, and chatbots\u003C/strong\u003E learn, think, and help us in our daily lives.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThrough hands-on activities, fun examples, and creative challenges, kids will explore how \u003Cstrong\u003EAI learns from data\u003C/strong\u003E, how it recognizes patterns like cats vs. dogs, and how it powers popular tools such as \u003Cstrong\u003Evoice assistants, search engines, and spell checkers\u003C/strong\u003E. Instead of abstract theories, children will experience \u003Cstrong\u003Einteractive AI projects\u003C/strong\u003E\u2014from playing tic-tac-toe against a simple algorithm to spotting everyday AI helpers around the home and school. By making \u003Cstrong\u003Emachine learning\u003C/strong\u003E playful, we help young learners see \u003Cstrong\u003Etechnology not just as magic, but as something they can understand and create with\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the biggest strengths of this course is its balance of \u003Cstrong\u003Eeducation and fun\u003C/strong\u003E.
