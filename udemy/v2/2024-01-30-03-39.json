Epithelium, connective tissue, muscle tissue, and nervous tissue have commonalities but look very distinct structurally after staining. Each stain exists to highlight an important feature or component within a tissue type. For example, one of the most common stains, Hematoxylin, is a basic dye that stains proteins a blue color, while Eosin stains proteins a pink color. These two stains are commonly used together to define intracellular organelles and proteins. Because of the variety of the proteins that exist, some stains were created to highlight a particular protein, which this review will discuss in the following sections. The benefit of using a special stain is that it can highlight the specific protein very well. However, because of its specificity, the other structures will not be seen. For this reason, multiple slides will often be created from a given specimen so that multiple stains can be performed to gather the full range of needed information.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlmost all tissue stains are performed on tissue that has been removed from the body. However, in rare instances, very specialize stains called vital stains can work on tissue remaining in the body. These stains are used for the identification of specific types of tissue and identification of abnormal tissue, so a subsequent biopsy can be more accurate in obtaining abnormal tissue\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETissue Preparation\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore specific staining can occur, tissue samples must undergo preparation through the following stages: Fixation, processing, embedding, sectioning, and sometimes antigen retrieval. In modern histology laboratories, most of these steps are automated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E.\u003Cstrong\u003EFixation: \u003C/strong\u003EFixation uses chemicals to preserve the structure of the tissue in its natural form and protects it from degradation by irreversibly cross-linking proteins. Although several specialized fixatives are available, Neutral Buffered Formalin is a common choice for this step. The fixation step is vital to the rest of the histologic staining procedure because by retaining the chemical composition of the tissue, the sample is hardened and makes the sectioning phase easier. Paraffin-formalin is another effective fixative. Its benefit is that it is the fixative of choice for immunostaining; however, it requires preparation at the time of the fixation. Bouin is a fixative used for examining embryo and brain tissue because of its superior preservation of delicate nuclei and glycogen. Its downside is that it does not preserve kidney tissues well and also distorts mitochondrial structure.[1]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDehydration: \u003C/strong\u003EThe addition of ethanol accomplishes the dehydration of a sample. It removed water from the sample and further hardens the tissue for eventual light microscopy. After ethanol is applied, and following the completion of tissue dehydration, xylene is used to remove the ethanol.[1]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEmbedding: \u003C/strong\u003EEmbedding is the process of putting the sample into a paraffin wax or a plastic resin to enhance the process of extracting cellular structures. This step is to be performed with caution if the goal is to perform immunostaining because the paraffin wax will inhibit the penetration of antibodies, and lead to a false result.[1]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESectioning: \u003C/strong\u003ESectioning involves mounting the specimen on a microtome and cutting it into sections. The preferred thickness is 4-5 micrometers so that it can be stained and put on a microscope slide for examination.[1]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAntigen Retrieval: \u003C/strong\u003EThis step is to retrieve antigens that could have been covered in the fixation and embedding stages. If the cross-linking of proteins conceals the antigen sites, there may not be as robust of an immunohistochemical response. Antigen retrieval is achieved through heating and proteolytic methods to break down the cross-links and reveal the epitopes and antigens that were previously covered.[1] Although this step carries the risk of denaturing both the fixative and the antigens themselves, a successful antigen retrieval method can lead to a much more effective immunostaining intensity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/histology-step-by-step/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5080670_193b.jpg","duration":"1.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"1,810.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Medical students, science students ,nursing students ,medical protectional"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":3,"averageValue":"4.2"},"instructors":[{"name":"Mohamed AL ashram","url":"/user/mohamed-taha-288/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.1666665}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"ED3C9AC8A6EBD65FC6ED","originalPrice":"\u20B93,499","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/practical-bacteriology-from-scratch/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4335680,"title":"practical bacteriology from scratch","shortDescription":"you  should know what will you do in lab","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003Epractical bacteriology from scratch\u0026nbsp; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyour safety first\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;take care when working with pathogenic microorganisms wear coat\u0026nbsp; when you are in lab and remove after finish keep the lab disk for equipment only wear gloves when dealing with microorganisms clean\u0026nbsp; clean\u0026nbsp; table before and after test mask eye protect\u0026nbsp; keep your hand away from mouth and eye and nose\u0026nbsp; use mechanical pipetting report the spill and disinfect the area well\u0026nbsp; wash hands after any procedure deal well with fire smooth small one with towel large one use expenditure follow the instructions included in lab safety manual be professional in handling microscope\u0026nbsp; there are many types with many uses bright field microscope\u0026nbsp; dark field microscope phase contrast microscope fluorescent microscope electro microscope\u0026nbsp; it is essential tool practice using the microscope with low power medium power\u0026nbsp; high power and take care when use oil immersion lens sterilization the most important topic in microbiology\u0026nbsp; without keeping your environment sterile it is impossible to obtain Apure culture\u0026nbsp; sterilization methods heat sterilization\u0026nbsp; sterilization by radiation sterilization by disinfectant chemicals\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;use of antimicrobial bacterial culture is a\u0026nbsp; method for isolate bacteria the culture may be natural in origin or synthetic or both culture may be ordinary enriched\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; blood agar is enriched media They contain substances Blood ,Serum.

By addressing stigma, we can create an environment where individuals feel comfortable seeking help, receiving appropriate care, and living fulfilling lives. Mental health stigma refers to the negative attitudes, beliefs, and stereotypes that surround mental health and mental illness. It involves prejudiced judgments, discrimination, and the marginalization of individuals with mental health conditions. Stigma can manifest at various levels, including societal, interpersonal, and self-stigma. Addressing mental health stigma involves promoting awareness, education, and challenging misconceptions. Efforts to reduce stigma aim to create a more supportive and understanding environment for individuals with mental health conditions, fostering a society where mental health is treated with the same importance and empathy as physical health. The objective of this course is to understand and explore the concept and types of mental health stigma, examine how mental health stigma affects individuals and society and develop strategies to combat mental health stigma. This course aims to help educators, students, research scholars, mental health practitioners and counselors to understand and apply strategies for combating mental health stigma and promoting mental health resilience.

These programs encompass a range of topics and skills that are essential for staying competitive, adapting to changing market dynamics, and fostering professional growth. Here\u0027s why these programs are important for companies and experts alike:","For Companies:  Stay Competitive: In the digital age, innovation is the key to staying competitive. Companies that fail to innovate risk becoming obsolete. Learning programs in innovation and digital transformation provide employees with the knowledge and skills to identify emerging trends, technologies, and business models, allowing their companies to adapt and thrive.","Adapt to Changing Markets: Markets are constantly evolving, and consumer preferences are shifting faster than ever before. Companies need to be agile and responsive to these changes. A workforce well-versed in digital transformation can help organizations pivot and adjust their strategies accordingly.","Efficiency and Cost Savings: Digital transformation often involves automation and process optimization, leading to increased efficiency and cost savings. Employees trained in these areas can identify opportunities to streamline operations, reduce waste, and improve overall productivity.","Customer-Centricity: Digital transformation is often driven by the need to better understand and serve customers. Learning programs in this area can teach employees how to gather and analyze customer data, leading to more personalized and effective marketing, sales, and customer service strategies.","Innovation Culture: Innovation is not limited to R\u0026D departments. It should permeate an organization\u0027s culture. Training programs can help employees develop an innovation mindset, encouraging them to proactively seek out opportunities for improvement and innovation.","Risk Management: The digital world is fraught with security and compliance risks. Learning programs in digital transformation can educate employees about cybersecurity best practices, data protection, and regulatory compliance, reducing the organization\u0027s exposure to potential risks.","For Experts:  Career Advancement: Professionals who possess skills in innovation and digital transformation are in high demand. Acquiring these skills can open up new career opportunities and increase earning potential.","Relevance: Staying current in a rapidly changing job market is essential. Learning about the latest trends and technologies ensures that experts remain relevant and marketable in their respective fields.","Entrepreneurship: For those interested in entrepreneurship, understanding digital transformation and innovation is critical for launching and scaling successful startups. These skills enable entrepreneurs to disrupt industries and create innovative solutions.","Problem-Solving: Innovation and digital transformation programs equip professionals with problem-solving skills that can be applied to a wide range of challenges in various industries. These problem-solving abilities are highly transferable and valuable.","Networking Opportunities: Participating in learning programs often leads to networking opportunities with peers, mentors, and industry leaders. Building a strong professional network can open doors to new career prospects and collaborations.","Personal Growth: Learning new skills and staying up-to-date with industry trends can be personally fulfilling. It can boost confidence and provide a sense of accomplishment, which in turn can enhance job satisfaction and overall well-being.","Learning programs in innovation and digital transformation are essential for both companies and experts. They enable organizations to thrive in a rapidly changing business environment and empower individuals to advance their careers, contribute to their organizations, and make a meaningful impact on their industries.","Mini MBA programs have gained significant popularity in recent years as a valuable educational option for both employers and experts seeking to enhance their careers or start their own businesses. These condensed, focused programs offer a taste of traditional MBA coursework without the time and financial commitments required by full-length MBA programs. Here\u0027s why Mini MBA programs are important for building careers and businesses:","1. Skill Enhancement: Mini MBA programs provide participants with a comprehensive understanding of key business principles, such as finance, marketing, strategy, and leadership. This knowledge equips individuals with the skills necessary to excel in their current roles or transition into new ones. Employers can benefit from employees who possess a broader skill set and can contribute more effectively to the organization\u0027s success.","2. Cost-Effective: Mini MBA programs are typically more affordable than full-length MBA programs, making them accessible to a wider range of professionals. This affordability allows individuals to invest in their education without incurring substantial debt, making it a viable option for those looking to advance their careers or start their own businesses.","3. Time Efficiency: Many professionals cannot commit to the two-year duration of a traditional MBA program due to work and personal commitments. Mini MBA programs are designed to be completed in a shorter time frame, often a few months, making it possible for individuals to balance their education with their existing responsibilities.","4. Networking Opportunities: Mini MBA programs often bring together a diverse group of professionals from various industries and backgrounds. This diversity fosters valuable networking opportunities, enabling participants to connect with peers, instructors, and industry experts. Building a strong professional network can open doors to new career opportunities and potential business collaborations.","5. Entrepreneurial Skill Development: Mini MBA programs are particularly beneficial for aspiring entrepreneurs. They offer insights into business planning, finance, marketing, and strategy \u2013 all critical aspects of launching and running a successful business. Entrepreneurs can use the knowledge gained from a Mini MBA program to make informed decisions and navigate the complexities of entrepreneurship.","6. Adaptability and Continuous Learning: In today\u0027s rapidly changing business landscape, adaptability and continuous learning are essential. Mini MBA programs provide participants with up-to-date knowledge and skills that can help them stay relevant and competitive in their careers. Employers value employees who are committed to ongoing learning and development.","7. Career Advancement: For employees looking to advance within their organizations, a Mini MBA can be a valuable asset. It demonstrates a commitment to professional growth and can make individuals more competitive for promotions and leadership positions.","8. Confidence Building: Mini MBA programs can boost the confidence of both employees and aspiring entrepreneurs. Knowing that you have a solid foundation in business concepts and strategies can empower you to take on new challenges and seize opportunities.","Mini MBA programs offer a cost-effective, time-efficient, and comprehensive way for both employers and experts to enhance their skills, advance their careers, and build successful businesses.
