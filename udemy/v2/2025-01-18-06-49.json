Course for any who want to build a career at Web3 or improve their knowledge.","Web3 refers to the next generation of the internet, often referred to as the decentralized web. It is envisioned as a more transparent, secure, and user-centric version of the internet, enabled by blockchain technology and decentralized protocols. In Web3, users have more control over their data and digital identities, and intermediaries such as centralized platforms are minimized or eliminated. This decentralized architecture offers various benefits such as increased privacy, censorship resistance, and the ability to create trustless interactions through smart contracts.","NFT stands for Non-Fungible Token. NFTs are unique digital assets that represent ownership or proof of authenticity of a particular item or piece of content, typically stored on a blockchain. Unlike cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, which are fungible and can be exchanged on a one-to-one basis, NFTs are indivisible and cannot be exchanged on a like-for-like basis due to their unique attributes. NFTs have gained significant attention in recent years, especially in the realms of digital art, collectibles, gaming, and virtual real estate, as they provide a way to establish scarcity and ownership in the digital world.","Learning about Web3 and NFTs is important for companies and managers for several reasons:  Understanding Emerging Technologies: Web3 and NFTs represent significant shifts in how we interact with the internet and digital assets. By staying informed about these technologies, companies and managers can anticipate trends and adapt their strategies accordingly.  New Business Opportunities: Web3 and NFTs open up new avenues for innovation and revenue generation. Companies that embrace these technologies can explore novel business models, such as decentralized finance (DeFi), tokenized assets, and digital collectibles.  Enhanced Customer Engagement: NFTs enable unique and personalized experiences for customers, whether through digital art, exclusive content, or virtual goods. By leveraging NFTs, companies can deepen customer engagement and foster a sense of community around their brand.","Mitigating Risks: As blockchain technology becomes more prevalent, understanding its implications becomes crucial for risk management. Companies need to grasp the security and regulatory considerations associated with Web3 and NFTs to protect their assets and reputation.  Developing skills in Web3 and NFTs can support career advancement or the launch of a business in several ways:  Technical Proficiency: Learning blockchain development, smart contract programming, and NFT standards (such as ERC-721 or ERC-1155) can open up opportunities for technical roles in blockchain-focused companies or projects.","Entrepreneurial Ventures: Individuals with expertise in Web3 and NFTs can capitalize on the growing demand for blockchain-based solutions by starting their own businesses. This could involve creating NFT marketplaces, developing blockchain games, or providing consultancy services to companies exploring blockchain integration.  Strategic Leadership: Managers who understand the potential of Web3 and NFTs can drive innovation within their organizations and guide strategic decisions related to blockchain adoption. This may involve identifying use cases, forming partnerships with blockchain startups, or implementing pilot projects to test new ideas.  Personal Branding: Building a reputation as a thought leader or expert in Web3 and NFTs can enhance career prospects and attract opportunities for speaking engagements, advisory roles, or partnerships.  In conclusion, learning about Web3 and NFTs is essential for companies and managers to stay competitive in a rapidly evolving digital landscape. By embracing these technologies and developing relevant skills, individuals can position themselves for career growth and entrepreneurial success in the blockchain industry."],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":42,"averageValue":"4.2"},"instructors":[{"name":"MTF Institute of Management, Technology and Finance","url":"/user/mtfinstitute/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.178571}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"15F66C31B1FDF3817485","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"7 hours","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/celpip-general-ls-for-canadian-citizenship/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":6272163,"title":"CELPIP General LS for Canadian Citizenship","shortDescription":"Boost Your English Skills to prove your proficiency for Canadian Citizenship!","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EThis course is designed to help you succeed in the \u003Cstrong\u003ECanadian Citizenship English Proficiency Test\u003C/strong\u003E, with a focus on improving your \u003Cstrong\u003EListening\u003C/strong\u003E and \u003Cstrong\u003ESpeaking\u003C/strong\u003E skills.

It is faster, cheaper and more accurate than previous techniques of editing DNA and has a wide range of potential applications.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHow does it work?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. The CRISPR-Cas9 system consists of two key molecules that introduce a change (mutation) into the DNA. These are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u2981\tan enzyme called Cas9. This acts as a pair of \u2018molecular scissors\u2019 that can cut the two strands of DNA at a specific location in the genome so that bits of DNA can then be added or removed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u2981\ta piece of RNA called guide RNA (gRNA). This consists of a small piece of pre-designed RNA sequence located within a longer RNA scaffold. The scaffold part binds to DNA and the pre-designed sequence \u2018guides\u2019 Cas9 to the right part of the genome. This makes sure that the Cas9 enzyme cuts at the right point in the genome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The guide RNA is designed to find and bind to a specific sequence in the DNA. The guide RNA has RNA bases that are complementary to those of the target DNA sequence in the genome. This means that, at least in theory, the guide RNA will only bind to the target sequence and no other regions of the genome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. The Cas9 follows the guide RNA to the same location in the DNA sequence and makes a cut across both strands of the DNA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. At this stage the cell recognizes that the DNA is damaged and tries to repair it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5.

However, they had no way of controlling where in the genome the mutation would occur.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor several years scientists have been using \u2018gene targeting\u2019 to introduce changes in specific places in the genome, by removing or adding either whole genes or single bases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETraditional gene targeting has been very valuable for studying genes and genetics, however it takes a long time to create a mutation and is fairly expensive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeveral \u2018gene editing\u2019 technologies have recently been developed to improve gene targeting methods, including CRISPR-Cas systems, transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) and zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe CRISPR-Cas9 system currently stands out as the fastest, cheapest and most reliable system for \u2018editing\u2019 genes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat are the applications and implications?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECRISPR-Cas9 has a lot of potential as a tool for treating a range of medical conditions that have a genetic component, including cancer, hepatitis B or even high cholesterol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany of the proposed applications involve editing the genomes of somatic (non-reproductive) cells but there has been a lot of interest in and debate about the potential to edit germline (reproductive) cells.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause any changes made in germline cells will be passed on from generation to generation it has important ethical implications.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECarrying out gene editing in germline cells is currently illegal in the UK and most other countries.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy contrast, the use of CRISPR-Cas9 and other gene editing technologies in somatic cells is uncontroversial.
