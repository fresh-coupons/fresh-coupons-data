It assumes that you\u0027re new to the language, so it gets you started with basic functionality such as creating functions, creating variables, and calling these lines of code from your standard HTML pages. It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E*\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E javascript course contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript introduction\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript array\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript variables\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript functions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript objects\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript control statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript cookies\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript loop statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript data structures\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript error handling\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript regular expressions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESection 4- python programming language.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis course section provides an introduction to programming and the python language. students are introduced to core python programming concepts like conditionals, loops, variables, and functions. this section includes an overview of the various python aspects.

In today\u2019s digital age, kids are already surrounded by \u003Cstrong\u003EAI in games, smart devices, and everyday apps\u003C/strong\u003E, but very few understand how it actually works. This course transforms curiosity into knowledge by teaching kids, in simple and enjoyable ways, how \u003Cstrong\u003Esmart computers, robots, and chatbots\u003C/strong\u003E learn, think, and help us in our daily lives.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThrough hands-on activities, fun examples, and creative challenges, kids will explore how \u003Cstrong\u003EAI learns from data\u003C/strong\u003E, how it recognizes patterns like cats vs. dogs, and how it powers popular tools such as \u003Cstrong\u003Evoice assistants, search engines, and spell checkers\u003C/strong\u003E. Instead of abstract theories, children will experience \u003Cstrong\u003Einteractive AI projects\u003C/strong\u003E\u2014from playing tic-tac-toe against a simple algorithm to spotting everyday AI helpers around the home and school. By making \u003Cstrong\u003Emachine learning\u003C/strong\u003E playful, we help young learners see \u003Cstrong\u003Etechnology not just as magic, but as something they can understand and create with\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the biggest strengths of this course is its balance of \u003Cstrong\u003Eeducation and fun\u003C/strong\u003E. Kids will learn how \u003Cstrong\u003EAI in games\u003C/strong\u003E makes characters smarter, how \u003Cstrong\u003Erobots with AI brains\u003C/strong\u003E follow instructions, and how \u003Cstrong\u003Ecomputer vision\u003C/strong\u003E allows machines to \u201Csee\u201D the world through cameras.

We emphasize that \u003Cstrong\u003EAI is a tool, not a replacement for humans\u003C/strong\u003E, and that kids themselves can be \u003Cstrong\u003Efuture AI creators\u003C/strong\u003E. Whether your child dreams of being a game designer, a scientist, an artist, or just wants to explore how the apps they use every day really work, this course provides a safe and inspiring starting point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the end of the program, students will be able to explain what \u003Cstrong\u003Eartificial intelligence\u003C/strong\u003E is, identify examples of \u003Cstrong\u003EAI in daily life\u003C/strong\u003E, and imagine their own future projects powered by technology. They\u2019ll see themselves not only as users of apps and devices, but as potential \u003Cstrong\u003Einnovators, builders, and problem-solvers\u003C/strong\u003E in a world where \u003Cstrong\u003EAI is everywhere\u003C/strong\u003E.
