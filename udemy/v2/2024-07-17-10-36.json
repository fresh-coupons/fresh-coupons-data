AutoCAD is primarily used for 2 Dimensional drawings, and even though 3D modeling is available in AutoCAD other computer-aided design software like Fusion 360, Inventor and Solidworks are preferred in 3D modeling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAutoCAD is used in industry, by architects, project managers, engineers, graphic designers, city planners and other professionals.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAutoCAD was derived from a program that began in 1977, and then released in 1979[4] called Interact CAD,[5][6][7] also referred to in early Autodesk documents as MicroCAD, which was written prior to Autodesk\u0027s (then Marinchip Software Partners) formation by Autodesk cofounder Michael Riddle.[8][9]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first version by Autodesk was demonstrated at the 1982 Comdex and released that December.

The native file format of AutoCAD is .dwg. This and, to a lesser extent, its interchange file format \u003Cem\u003EDXF\u003C/em\u003E, have become de facto, if proprietary, standards for CAD data interoperability, particularly for 2D drawing exchange.[12] AutoCAD has included support for .dwf, a format developed and promoted by Autodesk, for publishing CAD data.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/autocad-2d-advanced-level-quiz/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5320862_8c58.jpg","duration":"32 questions","enrolledStudentsCount":"3,473.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["For AutoCAD Users"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":16,"averageValue":"4.7"},"instructors":[{"name":"Ashish Pandit","url":"/user/ashish-pandit-56/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.75}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"27B6B85DCE2D4A2F2C88","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/google-analytics-ga4-gtm-for-beginners/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4152226,"title":"Google Analytics 4 (GA4): Become a Web Analytics Specialist!","shortDescription":"Unlock the Power of Google Analytics 4: Your Journey from Setup to Data Mastery","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EIn today\u2019s digital age, the Internet\u2019s pervasive influence and technological advancements have made web analytics an indispensable cornerstone for any successful online business.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecome a web analyst, a high-yield professional dedicated to processing, managing, and analyzing data across your company\u0027s digital ventures and third-party traffic channels.
