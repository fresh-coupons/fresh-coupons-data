It assumes that you\u0027re new to the language, so it gets you started with basic functionality such as creating functions, creating variables, and calling these lines of code from your standard HTML pages. It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are practicals of:\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E* Javascript Course Contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Array\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Variables\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Functions\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Objects\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/css-and-javascript-crash-course/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4271184_7325_2.jpg","duration":"1 total hour","enrolledStudentsCount":"106,373.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["For CSS And Beginners","For People Who want to learn CSS Fundamentals and later Transition into Web Designing","For People New to CSS And Javascript"],"tags":["CSS","JavaScript"],"rating":{"count":1428,"averageValue":"4.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"PROPER DOT INSTITUTE","url":"/user/vivek-dahibhate-2/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.0360823}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"8D0DE3543C40116ED7DF","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/curso-de-siteground-el-mejor-hosting-para-wordpress/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":3947090,"title":"Curso SiteGround 2024: El Mejor Hosting para WordPress","shortDescription":"Domina SiteGround, el mejor hosting para WordPress, y gestiona tus dominios y sitios web, de forma f\u00E1cil y simple.","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESITEGROUND\u003C/strong\u003E es un servicio de alojamiento web que proporciona alojamiento compartido, alojamiento en la nube, soluciones empresariales, alojamiento de correo electr\u00F3nico y registro de dominio.\u0026nbsp; Actualmente proporciona alojamiento para aproximadamente 2,000,000 de dominios en todo el mundo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ESiteGround proporciona servicios de alojamiento web para sitios web de WordPress , Joomla , Magento , Drupal , PrestaShop y WooCommerce. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/strong\u003ESi estas pensando crear un sitio web, blog o tienda virtual,\u003Cstrong\u003E este es el curso ideal para ti.

Indeed, you will at first learn all the basics of mathematics especially linear algebra. Once again, you will not become a specialist in this field but you will at least understand the basic concepts of it that can be useful for your understanding of quantum computing. Then, you will learn what exactly is an algorithm and what is the difference between a quantum algorithm and a classical mathematical algorithm. Also, we are going to cover different quantum algorithms that are also really popular in this field. Finally, you will have an introduction to Microsoft Q. In my opinion this is pretty important to learn because this is the programming language that is used to perform different quantum calculations as well as testing or running different quantum apps. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, it\u0027s really important to understand that I created this course on the Principe of learning by practice. This is why even if this course is mostly theoretical, I\u0026nbsp;tried to implement as much practice as possible. This way, when you will have completed this course you will not only be able to understand the basics of what is quantum computing but you will also be able to write basic lines of code and have a basic understanding of different quantum algorithms.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFor who is this course designed\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis course is created for beginners who have no prior knowledge of what is quantum computing and are interested by the topic. Indeed, you don\u0027t need to be an expert in any field to take this course, everything that is presented in this course is done very simply to help you understand from scratch everything you need to know about this topic. You will be introduced to different quantum algorithms as well as different mathematical notions that will allow to understand a bit more about this topic. So, if you are a student that wishes to learn more about this topic for educational or professional purposes you will definitely enjoy this course. Also, if you are just someone that find this topic interesting and you want to have a basic introduction to it well this course has everything you need. Not only you will understand Quantum computing in a theoretical way but you will also learn to use it in a more practical way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy should I take this course\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main reason is that you will be able to understand what exactly is quantum computing and all the concepts linked to it.
