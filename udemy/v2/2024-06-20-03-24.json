It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E*\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E javascript course contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript introduction\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript array\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript variables\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript functions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript objects\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript control statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript cookies\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript loop statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript data structures\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript error handling\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript regular expressions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003Esection 3- learn PHP\u0026nbsp;programming language\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this section, we will learn the basic structure of a web application, and how a web browser interacts with a web server.

Great models to apply and learn and useful lifelong!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I wanted to take a moment to express my sincere appreciation for the outstanding online course on interpersonal communication skills that I recently completed. This course has truly exceeded my expectations and has been an invaluable learning experience. The content was not only comprehensive but also exceptionally well- structured. Each module provided a deep dive into various aspects of interpersonal communication, offering practical insights and strategies that are immediately applicable in real-world scenarios. The inclusion of real-life examples and case studies enhanced my understanding and allowed me to see the relevance of the concepts in different contexts.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The quality of the course is outstanding ,the language used in the course is very worth understanding doesn\u0027t content difficult or technical words that allows learner to connect easily with the content. Along with this the examples and diagram makes the course more simple and effective to the learner..\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022This course has drastically changed my mind pertaining to the importance of interpersonal skills, earlier I used to consider it is natural.

Highly recommended...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022This helped me to realize what I wasn\u0027t doing. Being in Information Technology, we sometimes do not compliment or try to get to know the people that we do work for. This makes it very hard to have a good relationship with people, and makes the work environment seem hostile sometimes.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The course content is extremely beneficial, adds value, and teaches students how to deal with hostile situations and improve their interpersonal skills. It is a must for managers who want to improve their interpersonal skills in the workplace.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The video lectures are very easy to follow. In the course, knowledge like \u201Csix ways to let people like you\u201D and \u201Cmanage egos\u201D is really useful in real life, and the homework is a good way to look back at the knowledge.
