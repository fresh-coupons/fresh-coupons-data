Includes JSX, Callbacks, Events, \u002B More","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EThis course takes you step-by-step through the process of building a fully functional calculator in React. React, also known as React JS, is a powerful JavaScript library used for building custom, interactive user interfaces using UI components. Some of the most well known examples of organizations using React for their front-end include Netflix, Facebook, and Airbnb. Developed and maintained by Meta along with a community of independent developers, React remains free and open-source. React is a component based library built entirely on JavaScript, which makes it perfect for designing complex UI\u2019s. With React, developers can build encapsulated components that efficiently manage their own state and render UI updates specifically when data changes. For example, think of the automated content refresh feature you see on a twitter feed, or facebook like button. Here the state of the UI component changes on the page, without having to manually refresh when the data is updated. This is just one small, yet powerful feature of React.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThrough a complete hands-on project, this course will teach you all the fundamental principles of React that you must know to become a proficient React developer. We start right from the basics, including the tools needed to get started. From there we dive into JSX, functional components, props, callbacks, and various OnClick events. By this stage, the calculator will have a complete visual display, coupled with functional arithmetic operations. Students then move on to passing parameters in Callback functions, using the React State Hook, and debugging.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn addition to the hands-on React module, we also offer a comprehensive overview of JavaScript for those who need a refresher. Here we start with introducing students to the document object model (DOM) which defines the logical structure of HTML documents. From there we dive into JavaScript to demonstrate various methods in which DOM elements can be manipulated to add interactivity to static components. We start right from the basics, which includes JavaScript placement, and data output. From there we move on to variable declaration, arithmetic operations, operator precedence, data types, and objects. Once the foundations are covered, we move on to more complex operations using Arrays, Conditional Statements, JavaScript comparison operators, booleans and loops. Here students will learn to unleash the true power of JavaScript to render different outcomes based on user interaction. We will explore the use of functions to efficiently handle repetitive tasks and JavaScript events to handle output based on actions and occurrences. The section will conclude with a hands-on project where students will implement their knowledge to build a web based photo gallery and background color changer. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAs you can see this course covers a tremendous bit of ground. Best of all it features Tim Maclachlan - a renowned senior full-stack developer with over 20 years of commercial development experience. As a multi-faceted developer, Tim specializes in algorithmic, analytical and mobile development. To date, he\u2019s written hundreds of applications and worked in a number of industries from commercial aviation and military, to banking and finance.

It assumes that you\u0027re new to the language, so it gets you started with basic functionality such as creating functions, creating variables, and calling these lines of code from your standard HTML pages. It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables.

No wonder: it can process data on an enormous scale, supports multiple coding languages (you can use Java, Scala, Python, R, and SQL) and runs on its own or in the cloud, as well as on other systems (e.g., Hadoop or Kubernetes).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this Apache Spark tutorial, I will introduce you to one of the most notable use cases of Apache Spark: machine learning. In less than two hours, we will go through every step of a machine learning project that will provide us with an accurate telecom customer churn prediction in the end.

One of them is called MLlib. To put it simply, it allows the Spark Core to perform machine learning tasks \u2013 and (as you will see in this Apache Spark tutorial) does it in breathtaking speed. Due to its ability to handle significant amounts of data, Apache Spark is perfect for tasks related to machine learning, as it can ensure more accurate results when training algorithms.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMastering Apache Spark machine learning can also be a skill highly sought after by employers and headhunters: more and more companies get interested in applying machine learning solutions for business analytics, security, or customer service.

That\u2019s why I haven\u2019t included any purely theoretical lectures in this Apache Spark tutorial: you will learn everything on the way and be able to put it into practice straight away. Seeing the way each feature works will help you learn Apache Spark machine learning thoroughly by heart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will also be providing some materials in ZIP archives.

This shift is not merely aesthetic; it\u0027s an economic imperative. Inferior software can incur hefty remediation costs, jeopardize user trust, and even lead to revenue losses.

For instance, in the aftermath of a significant economic downturn, professionals with a deep-rooted understanding are more likely to navigate job transitions seamlessly. At the same time, those who\u0027ve solely relied on memorization for short-term objectives, like clearing an interview, may find themselves ill-equipped to adapt.
