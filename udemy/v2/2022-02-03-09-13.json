Take control over your life","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EThe way you think influences the way you feel and behave. Irrational thoughts will lead to emotional distress and behavioral problems. Rational thoughts will help you experience positive emotions or negative, yet adaptive emotions. We all experience both types of thoughts - rational and irrational. But few know how to identify and separate them, so often they rule our life. Learn how to identify your irrational thinking patterns and make them more rational, through rational emotive behavior therapy (REBT).\u0026nbsp; Most times, we make the mistake of thinking that the events are the ones that bother us, which gives us little to no control at all. In fact, it is us that interpret all the events in our lives (both internal and external), and make them more or less important. Being able to understand this connection and differentiate the existing reality from the one we create, makes a whole lot of difference. You will learn how to make the connection between your thoughts and the way you feel and behave. This way, you will regain control of your life, feel happier and more productive. How will we do that? Simply - by teaching you the main disputing techniques that will give you control over your thoughts and thus, over your emotions and behaviors. \u003C/p\u003E","language":"Inglese","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/irrational/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2814607_ed16_4.jpg","duration":"34 min","enrolledStudentsCount":"8.632 studenti","lastUpdated":"Ultimo aggiornamento 2/2020","targetAudiences":["People who want to identify their irrational thinking patterns","People who want to experience less dysfunctional emotions","People who want to have less maladaptive behaviours"],"tags":["Sviluppo personale","Trasformazione personale","Trasformazione personale"],"rating":{"count":32,"averageValue":"4.3"},"instructors":[{"name":"Sebastian Vaida","url":"/user/sebastian-vaida/","totalNumberOfStudents":42789,"totalNumberOfReviews":516,"averageRating":4.3771258495575225}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"FEBRUARY","originalPrice":"\u20B91,920","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"3 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/henry-zhang-email-monetization-mini-course/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4062654,"title":"Email Monetization Mastery 2022","shortDescription":"How to join the ranks of successful list builders quickly and easily to increase engagement and build your tribes !","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETurning your email list into a passive income money maker isn\u2019t as difficult, or time consuming as you may think.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEvery day, thousands of online marketers are transforming their mailing lists into powerful cash funnels, and quite often, they don\u2019t even have their own product line!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis course will make it easy for you to start making money with your subscriber base even if you\u2019re just starting out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt will show you how you can join the ranks of successful list builders quickly and easily, while increasing engagement, building your tribe and positioning yourself as a thought leader in your market.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Email Monetization Course For EVERY Level\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis course is your fast track to Email Monetization success and will provide long-lasting value from your very first product designed right through to advanced sales and marketing campaigns.

One can feel enthusiastic, happy, sad, anxious, angry and life can often feel like an emotional roller coaster.

While this might seem straightforward and logic, it is not always true. Positive emotions are desirable, yet not always useful. There are times when negative emotions need to occur, yet this must be within our control. Learn to differentiate between these two categories and how to control them.

Fun and Easy Editing","shortDescription":"Learn how to bring life to your images","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003ESnapseed is one of the best apps for editing photographs. It is very intuitive, user friendly and free. It works both on Android and iOS and for someone who enjoys taking smartphone photos, it is an excellent choice for editing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe goal of this course is to help you be(come) confident in using Snapseed, starting from the very beginning, the tools. Once you understand how these tools work, then you can use them precisely on your needs and not just apply them and hope they work. Because photography is such a creative domain, no two photos are alike. And nor is their editing. Therefore, it is best to understand what you are doing (both in taking photos and editing) and apply that knowledge. Next, after you understand what each tool does, you can apply them individually or combined, confident that you will know what the end result will look like. Unlike other courses, this one covers the basics of these tools, to give you knowledge and confidence. If you already know these tools, simply skip to the parts that are of interest for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou will notice that the course is divided in three major parts. First part covers the basic tools I mentioned before (how to apply each tool to an image and the effects it brings). The second part covers examples of simple editing applied to certain images, where several tools are combined. And the third part covers more advanced editing, where you can see nine images from three categories (architecture, landscape and commercial), edited from zero to finish, with most of the tools combined and explained.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor your convenience, I also added the images used for this course, so you can use them yourself in your editing and learning process. Feel free to use them or experiment with your own photos.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETaking part in this course, you will receive an A to Z training from a professional photographer and trainer, on a pace that is specifically thought for you, with real life examples of locations and objects. Going through this course will give you access to all the updates that will follow and allow you to edit both your personal photos in a way to amaze your friends and also edit images for professional reasons, should you decide you want to sell photos online or photos of products to be commercialized online. The info I give in this course also comes from years of experience selling photos online on dedicated websites for stock photography. And nowadays, with the advances of smartphone cameras and editing apps, the balance of DSLR versus smartphone photos rapidly tilts towards smartphone photos for me and other photographers and, why not, for you as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end, you will become more consistent in taking photos, because now you know that you are able to bring them to life the way you saw them in your mind. You will also become more confident in editing photos and advancing into more complex editing techniques. Last, you will do all of this in a fun and relaxing way. Because photography should be, first and foremost, enjoyable.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"Anglais","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/snapseed-fun-and-easy-editing/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2290575_a647.jpg","duration":"1,5\u00A0heures","enrolledStudentsCount":"3\u00A0430 participants","lastUpdated":"Derni\u00E8re mise \u00E0 jour\u00A0: 10/2021","targetAudiences":["Beginner photographers using smartphone cameras and Snapseed app","People of any age passionate about photography","People lacking the time to learn difficult editing programs for months or years","People who take photos daily for personal reasons and want to share them with their friends","People who take photos for professional reasons and want to use them for selling products or sell them to micro stock agencies"],"tags":["Photographie et vid\u00E9o","Photographie et vid\u00E9o - Divers","Traitement d\u0027images"],"rating":{"count":46,"averageValue":"4.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"Sebastian Vaida","url":"/user/sebastian-vaida/","totalNumberOfStudents":42789,"totalNumberOfReviews":516,"averageRating":4.3771258495575225}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"FEBRUARY","originalPrice":"\u20B96,400","discountedPrice":"\u20B94,160","expirationText":"5 hours","discountPercentage":35}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/agile-ba/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":3891398,"title":"Agile IT Business Analysis Made Comprehensible","shortDescription":"Business Analysis Procedures for Developing Requirements, User Stories, and Software Features","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EA simplified and useful tutorial to assist learners to get insights into Business Analysis.
