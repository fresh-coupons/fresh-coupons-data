By making \u003Cstrong\u003Emachine learning\u003C/strong\u003E playful, we help young learners see \u003Cstrong\u003Etechnology not just as magic, but as something they can understand and create with\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the biggest strengths of this course is its balance of \u003Cstrong\u003Eeducation and fun\u003C/strong\u003E. Kids will learn how \u003Cstrong\u003EAI in games\u003C/strong\u003E makes characters smarter, how \u003Cstrong\u003Erobots with AI brains\u003C/strong\u003E follow instructions, and how \u003Cstrong\u003Ecomputer vision\u003C/strong\u003E allows machines to \u201Csee\u201D the world through cameras. They\u2019ll also try out activities like designing their own \u003Cstrong\u003EAI buddy\u003C/strong\u003E, talking to a \u003Cstrong\u003Echatbot\u003C/strong\u003E, and creating silly stories with \u003Cstrong\u003EAI writing tools\u003C/strong\u003E. Every lesson is filled with storytelling, examples from kid-friendly favorites like Pok\u00E9mon, Minecraft, and WALL-E, and plenty of laughter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EParents will love that this course goes beyond entertainment\u2014it builds \u003Cstrong\u003Ecritical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving skills\u003C/strong\u003E. By understanding both the \u003Cstrong\u003Ebenefits of AI\u003C/strong\u003E and its \u003Cstrong\u003Eresponsibilities\u003C/strong\u003E, kids gain an early awareness of how technology shapes our world. We emphasize that \u003Cstrong\u003EAI is a tool, not a replacement for humans\u003C/strong\u003E, and that kids themselves can be \u003Cstrong\u003Efuture AI creators\u003C/strong\u003E. Whether your child dreams of being a game designer, a scientist, an artist, or just wants to explore how the apps they use every day really work, this course provides a safe and inspiring starting point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the end of the program, students will be able to explain what \u003Cstrong\u003Eartificial intelligence\u003C/strong\u003E is, identify examples of \u003Cstrong\u003EAI in daily life\u003C/strong\u003E, and imagine their own future projects powered by technology. They\u2019ll see themselves not only as users of apps and devices, but as potential \u003Cstrong\u003Einnovators, builders, and problem-solvers\u003C/strong\u003E in a world where \u003Cstrong\u003EAI is everywhere\u003C/strong\u003E.

It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables.
