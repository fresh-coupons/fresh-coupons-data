It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are practicals of:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E* Javascript Course Contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Array\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Variables\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Functions\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Objects\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Control Statements\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Cookies\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Loop statements\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESee you inside the course\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-practicals-crash-course/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4200228_c917_2.jpg","duration":"38 total mins","enrolledStudentsCount":"132,356.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["For Javascript  Programming Beginners","For People New to Javascript","For People Who want to learn Javascript Fundamentals and later Transition into Web Development"],"tags":["JavaScript"],"rating":{"count":1898,"averageValue":"4.2"},"instructors":[{"name":"PROPER DOT INSTITUTE","url":"/user/vivek-dahibhate-2/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.14}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"7CEDA55E16127F46E4F0","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/leadership-through-tough-times/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4866888,"title":"Leadership Through Tough Times","shortDescription":"How to cope as a Leader in uncertain times","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003ELeadership Through Tough Times - How to cope as a Leader in uncertain times aims to help anyone in positions of responsibility as a:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Manager\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Unit leaders\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Business owner\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Responsible for others and outcomes\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Anyone needing to make difficult decisions in times that seem uncertain\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt looks at the various elements that should be at the very least referenced: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Roles and responsibility\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Clarity of message\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Realistic perspectives\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Possible solutions\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Causes and not just effects of why things are what they are\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Seeking support, help\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- How to approach things with sympathy, understanding and empathy, even in tough times\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- How to handle tough conversations\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Challenges anyone in a Leadership position will most likely face and much more\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERealising that the world around you or that you may be responsible for is changing, sometime, through no fault or contribution of your own, can be daunting.
