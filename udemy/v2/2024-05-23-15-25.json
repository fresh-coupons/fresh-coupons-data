He makes every other course seem like a prologue and I know I am going to be the confident, well prepared speaker that I always sought to become. The magnitude of material and the pieces of golden wisdom are so practical to today\u0027s environment. It hardly seems possible that a teacher of this quality would be so giving and available to the average person like myself, when he is qualified to coach Kings and Dignitaries. Only one-third through the course and already my Charity fundraising efforts are more effective because I have gained skills to improve my communication, both my message and my delivery. The clarity of TJ Walker\u0027s delivery demonstrates his message in action. Follow him on Facebook and YouTube for greater depth if you find yourself improving from absorbing his work as I have. Do the assignments promptly and you will improve with each session. Worth the investment of time and that is what I value most, TJ WALKER delivered value with each session, and made the most of my time.\u0022\u0026nbsp;Debbie Tudor\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat others say about the instructor:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u201CTJ Walker\u0027s single-minded devotion to presentation has made him the #1 expert for executives seeking guidance on speaking to the public and media.\u0022 \u003Cem\u003EBob Bowdon, Anchor/Reporter, Bloomberg Television\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u201CTJ Walker is the leading media trainer in the world.\u0022 \u003Cem\u003EStu Miller, Viacom News Producer\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(TJ Walker\u0027s Media Training Worldwide) \u201CThe world\u0027s leading presentation and media training firm.\u0022\u003Cem\u003EGregg Jarrett, Fox News Channel Anchor\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/how-to-deliver-an-elevator-pitch/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/364026_36eb_2.jpg","duration":"10 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"26,199.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Entrepreneurs ","Job seekers","Executives"],"tags":["Communication Skills","Investor Pitching","Personal Branding"],"rating":{"count":191,"averageValue":"4.6"},"instructors":[{"name":"TJ Walker","url":"/user/tjwalker2/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.529851},{"name":"Media Training Worldwide Digital","url":"/user/media-training-worldwide-digital/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.529851}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"5A17E0504207F9F87FD8","originalPrice":"\u20B92,299","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/how-to-deliver-technology-presentations/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":363870,"title":"Public Speaking Skills: Deliver Great Technology Talks","shortDescription":"Public Speaking: Complex technology messages can be presented in a clear and memorable way","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPublic Speaking \u003C/strong\u003Egoes hand in hand with great technology advances!\u0026nbsp;Imagine you are delivering a technology presentation and your audience is riveted by your messages and your style.
