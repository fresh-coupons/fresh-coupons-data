The goal of computer forensics is to perform a structured investigation and maintain a documented chain of evidence to find out exactly what happened on a computing device and who was responsible for it. Computer forensics -- which is sometimes referred to as computer forensic science essentially is data recovery with legal compliance guidelines to make the information admissible in legal proceedings. The terms digital forensics and cyber forensics are often used as synonyms for computer forensics. Digital forensics starts with the collection of information in a way that maintains its integrity. Investigators then analyze the data or system to determine if it was changed, how it was changed and who made the changes. The use of computer forensics isn\u0027t always tied to a crime. The forensic process is also used as part of data recovery processes to gather data from a crashed server, failed drive, reformatted operating system (OS) or other situation where a system has unexpectedly stopped working.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy is computer forensics important?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the civil and criminal justice system, computer forensics helps ensure the integrity of digital evidence presented in court cases.

In this module, you will learn how to publish your app to the Google Play Store. You will also explore strategies for app monetization, including in-app purchases\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven though Kotlin is a full-fledged functional programming language, it preserves most of the object-oriented nature of Java as an alternative programming style, which is very handy when converting existing Java code. Kotlin has classes with constructors, along with nested, inner, and anonymous inner classes, and it has interfaces like Java 8. Kotlin does \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E have a new keyword. To create a class instance, call the constructor just like a regular function. We saw that in the screenshot above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKotlin has single inheritance from a named superclass, and all Kotlin classes have a default superclass Any, which is \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E the same as the Java base class java.lang.Object. Any contains only three predefined member functions: equals(), hashCode(), and toString().\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKotlin classes have to be marked with the open keyword in order to allow other classes to inherit from them; Java classes are kind of the opposite, as they are inheritable \u003Cem\u003Eunless\u003C/em\u003E marked with the final keyword. To override a superclass method, the method itself must be marked open, and the subclass method must be marked override. This is all of a piece with Kotlin\u2019s philosophy of making things explicit rather than relying on defaults. In this particular case, I can see where Kotlin\u2019s way of explicitly marking base class members as open for inheritance and derived class members as overrides avoids several kinds of common Java errors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, you\u0027ll learn how to create apps and run them on virtual devices through guided exercises. You\u0027ll cover the fundamentals of Android development, from structuring an app to building out the UI with Activities and Fragments and various navigation patterns. Progressing through the chapters and lectures, you\u0027ll delve into Android\u0027s RecyclerView to make the most of displaying lists of data and become comfortable with fetching data from a web service and handling images. You\u0027ll then learn about mapping, location services, and the permissions model before working with notifications and how to persist data. Moving on, you\u0027ll get to grips with testing, covering the full spectrum of the test pyramid. You\u0027ll also learn how AAC (Android Architecture Components) are used to cleanly structure your code and explore various architecture patterns and the benefits of dependency injection. \u003Cem\u003EThe core libraries of RxJava and Coroutines are covered for asynchronous programming\u003C/em\u003E. The focus then returns to the UI, demonstrating how to add motion and transitions when users interact with your apps. Towards the end, you\u0027ll build an interesting app to retrieve and display popular movies from a movie database, and then see how to publish your apps on Google Play. By the end of this course, you\u0027ll have the skills and confidence needed to build fully-fledged Android apps using Kotlin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre you trying to start a career in Android programming, but haven\u0027t found the right way in? Do you have a great idea for an app, but don\u0027t know how to make it a reality? Or maybe you\u0027re just frustrated that to learn Android, you must already know Kotlin. If so, then this course is for you\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen Android first arrived in 2008, it was a bit drab compared to the much more stylish iOS on the Apple iPhone/iPad. But, quite quickly, through a variety of handset offers that struck a chord with practical, price-conscious consumers, as well as those who are fashion-conscious and tech-savvy, Android user numbers exploded. For many, myself included, developing for Android is the most rewarding pastime and business, bar none. Quickly putting together a prototype of an idea, refining it, and then deciding to run with it and wire it up into a fully-fledged app, is such an exciting and rewarding process. Any programming can be fun \u2013 I have been programming all my life \u2013 but creating for Android is somehow extraordinarily rewarding..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKotlin is the most succinct language, and therefore is the least error-prone, \u003Cem\u003Ewhich is great for beginners\u003C/em\u003E. Kotlin is also the most fun language, mainly because the succinctness means you can get results faster and with less code. Google considers Kotlin an official (first-class) Android language. There are some other advantages to Kotlin that make it less error-prone and less likely to make mistakes that cause crashes. We will discover the details of these advantages as we proceed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKotlin is an object-oriented language. This means that it uses the concept of reusable programming objects. If this sounds like technical jargon, another analogy will help. Kotlin enables us and others (like the Android API development team) to write code that can be structured based on real-world things, and here is the important part \u2013 it can be reused.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/kotlin-android-training-android-app-development/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4365954_c92d_6.jpg","duration":"15.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"116,103.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Beginner Kotlin Developers","Android Kotlin Programming Training","Mobile App Development Course"],"tags":["Android Development","Kotlin"],"rating":{"count":768,"averageValue":"4.3"},"instructors":[{"name":"OCSALY Academy | 500.000\u002B Students","url":"/user/online-academy-of-computer-science/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.273585}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"KOTLIN_5-STAR-PLS","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/essential-excel-for-beginner-to-advanced/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5002062,"title":"Essential Microsoft Excel from Beginner to Advance level","shortDescription":"Microsoft Excel Beginner to Professional.

FreePastry is used to illustrate one open source peer-to-peer solution framework.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe will discuss about \u003Cstrong\u003EUDP\u003C/strong\u003E and\u003Cstrong\u003E Multicasting\u003C/strong\u003E and how it provides provides a less reliable but more efficient way for applications to communicate across the Internet. Java\u0027s extensive support for this protocol is demonstrated, including \u003Cstrong\u003ENIO\u003C/strong\u003E support, and how UDP can support streaming media. We will also cover in our udemy course Network Scalability, I will explain how, as more demands are placed on a server,\u0026nbsp; systems need to scale to address these demands. Several threading techniques supporting this need are demonstrated, including thread pools, futures, and the \u003Cstrong\u003ENIO\u0027\u003C/strong\u003Es selector. We will also cover in our udemy course Network Security, you\u2019ll learn how applications need to protect against a variety of threats. This is supported in Java using encryption and secure hashing techniques. Symmetric and asymmetric encryption techniques are illustrated. In addition, the use of \u003Cstrong\u003ETLS/SSL\u003C/strong\u003E is demonstrated. We will also cover in our udemy course covers how Java applications may need to exchange information with other applications that are written in different languages. The issues that impact an application\u0027s interoperability are examined, including byte order. Communication between different implementations is demonstrated using sockets and middleware.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll the Java program communications over the network are done at the application layer. The \u003Cstrong\u003Ejava . net \u003C/strong\u003Epackage of the\u003Cstrong\u003E J2SE\u003C/strong\u003E APIs comprises various classes and interfaces that execute the low-level communication features, enabling the user to formulate programs that focus on resolving the problem. The Java platform is highly regarded in part because of its suitability for writing programs that use and interact with the resources on the Internet and the World Wide Web(\u003Cstrong\u003EWWW\u003C/strong\u003E). In fact, Java-compatible browsers use this ability of the Java platform to the extreme to transport and run applets over the Internet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJava is a premier language for network programming.\u0026nbsp; \u003Cstrong\u003Ejava . net\u003C/strong\u003E package encapsulate large number of classes and interface that provides an easy-to use means to access network resources.

In either case, congratulations on selecting one of the most fast-paced segments of the automotive industry. Working with the electrical systems can be challenging, yet very rewarding; however, it can also be very frustrating at times. For many people, learning electrical systems can be a struggle. It is my hope that I am able to present the course to you in such a manner that you will not only understand electrical systems, but will excel at it. There are many ways the theory of electricity can be explained, and many metaphors can be used. Some compare electricity to a water flow, while others explain it in a purely scientific fashion. Everyone learns differently. I am presenting electrical theory in a manner that I hope will be clear and concise. If you do not fully comprehend a concept, then it is important to discuss it with your instructor. Electricity is somewhat abstract; so if you do have questions, be sure to ask me in Udemy ask section.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy Become an Electrical System Technician? \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the past, it was possible for technicians to work their entire careers and be able to almost completely avoid the vehicle\u2019s electrical systems. They would specialize in engines, steering/ suspension, or brakes. Today, there is not a system on the vehicle that is immune to the role of electrical circuits. Engine controls, electronic suspension systems, and anti-lock brakes are common on today\u2019s vehicles. Even electrical systems that were once thought of as being simple have evolved to computer controls. Headlights are now pulse-width modulated using high side drivers and will automatically brighten and dim based on the light intensity of oncoming traffic. Today\u2019s vehicles are equipped with twenty or more computers, laser-guided cruise control, sonar park assist, infrared climate control, fiber optics, and radio frequency transponders and decoders. Simple systems have become more computers reliant. For example, the horn circuit on the 2008 Chrysler 300C involves three separate control modules to function. Even the tires have computers involved, with the addition of tire pressure monitoring systems!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday\u2019s technician must possess a full and complete electrical background to be able to succeed.

Whenever they dismantle something, they can reassemble it how it was. Whenever they say that they need to investigate the hood, they can really get the darn thing open. Furthermore, when they need to change a level, they don\u0027t endure ten minutes attempting to sort out which end of the raise is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFortunately, you don\u0027t need to be brought into the world with a wrench in your grasp to know how to fix things \u2014 even things as apparently convoluted as a vehicle.

I likewise incorporate guidelines for filling the gas tank yourself (it\u0027s less expensive than full-administration), a reliable technique for dismantling anything and assembling it back once more, and security pointers that each technician \u2014 experienced and amateur \u2014 ought to notice.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/car-repair-auto-mechanic-training/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4624160_7f02_9.jpg","duration":"8 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"76,832.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Beginner Car Mechanics","Auto Mechanic Course Learners","Car Mechanic Training Course","Car Mechanic Training","Automotive Repair Training","Online Auto Mechanic Course","Auto Repair Class","Car Mechanic School"],"tags":["Car Repair"],"rating":{"count":1352,"averageValue":"3.6"},"instructors":[{"name":"OCSALY Academy | 500.000\u002B Students","url":"/user/online-academy-of-computer-science/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":3.7941177}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"CAR-REPAIR-ACADEMY","originalPrice":"\u20B92,999","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/digital-forensics-course/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4372164,"title":"Digital Forensics Masterclass :Computer Forensics DFMC\u002B DFIR","shortDescription":"Learn digital forensics and be computer forensics investigator / Certificate after completing course / DFMC\u002B / DFIR 2025","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBecome a Digital Forensics Investigator and learn one of most requested skills of 2025!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the \u003Cstrong\u003Emost comprehensive, yet straight-forward, course for the Digital Forensics on Udemy!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E*Get the Official Certificate after Completing the Course\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEmbark on an in-depth journey into the realm of \u003Cstrong\u003Edigital forensics\u003C/strong\u003E with this \u003Cstrong\u003E17-hour and 30\u002B minute masterclass\u003C/strong\u003E.
