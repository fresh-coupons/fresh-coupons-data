You will get acquainted with technical and fundamental analysis and you will use different tools for your analysis. You will learn the Python environment completely. You will also learn deep learning algorithms and artificial neural networks that can greatly enhance your financial analysis skills and expertise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis tutorial begins by exploring various ways of downloading financial data and preparing it for modeling. We check the basic statistical properties of asset prices and returns, and investigate the existence of so-called stylized facts.

We also introduce you to factor models, including the famous Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and the Fama-French three-factor model. We end this section by demonstrating different ways to optimize asset allocation, and we use Monte Carlo simulations for tasks such as calculating the price of American options or estimating the Value at Risk (VaR).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the last part of the course, we carry out an entire data science project in the financial domain. We approach credit card fraud/default problems using advanced classifiers such as random forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, stacked models, and many more. We also tune the hyperparameters of the models (including Bayesian optimization) and handle class imbalance. We conclude the book by demonstrating how deep learning (using PyTorch) can solve numerous financial problems.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/python-and-machine-learning-in-financial-analysis/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4248756_2478.jpg","duration":"20.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"66,225.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Developers","Financial Analysts","Data Analysts","Data Scientists","Stock and cryptocurrency traders","Students","Teachers","Researchers"],"tags":["Python"],"rating":{"count":525,"averageValue":"4.5"},"instructors":[{"name":"S.
