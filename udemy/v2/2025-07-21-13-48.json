TJ highlights how presentation preparation typically goes off the railroad tracks - gather lots of data, prepare slides, churn back and forth on ordering, ranking, wording, etc. Worse yet, folks (even US Presidents) continue tweaking speeches at the last minute. TJ gives step by step details on the structured process to focus on your #1 objective - what you want the audience to ***DO*** after listening to your speech, and #2 - focus on no more than FIVE topics you want the audience to remember. Gone are the days with dozens of data points, stacks of mind-numbing slides with drab numbers and tiny text.
