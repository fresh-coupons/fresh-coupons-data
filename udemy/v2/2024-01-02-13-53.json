After this, we are going to build a comments system and this will be the biggest project in this course. We will begin first by doing a post system and then we will grab comments for every post that we have of course we will use Ajax-JQuery for inserting, deleting, and showing comments. after that, we will integrate a rating system into the previous two projects to make a bigger project. So, I will show how to download a JQuery plugin, how to integrate it and how to use it to do the rating system for every post, and so on. And the rating system is going to be implemented of course using Ajax-JQuery. The upcoming project is going to be also created with Ajax and JQuery and that\u0027s a live search system and we will combine it with our big project. The last project will be about building a weather app. All we are going to do is set up a form, allow the user to enter a city, and then give him the current degree of this city.

An effective incident response plan can help minimize these disruptions and facilitate a quicker recovery.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecurity Improvement: Incident response provides an opportunity for organizations to learn from the attack and improve their cybersecurity defenses. By analyzing how the attack occurred and what vulnerabilities were exploited, organizations can implement measures to prevent similar incidents in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EContainment and Mitigation: A well-executed incident response plan can help contain the spread of ransomware within an organization\u0027s network, preventing further damage and data encryption. Quick containment can limit the extent of the breach and reduce the impact.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELegal and Ethical Considerations: Organizations need to consider the ethical and legal implications of paying ransoms. An incident response plan should include a strategy for making these difficult decisions, taking into account the potential consequences and compliance requirements.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPreparedness for Future Attacks: Ransomware attacks are on the rise, and organizations need to be prepared for future incidents.

The Daily Scrum is a self-organized meeting for the Development Team. The role of the Scrum Master is to facilitate the meeting if necessary and ensure that it is held within the 15-minute time box. The Scrum Master is responsible for reinforcing the rules of Scrum, aiding the team in staying focused and efficient. The Daily Scrum is not for the Scrum Master to lead or assign tasks, nor is it a platform for the Scrum Master to update stakeholders or the Sprint Backlog.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EQuestion: Which of the following best describes the purpose of the Sprint Retrospective?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA) To review the work completed in the Sprint and demonstrate it to stakeholders.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB) To plan the next Sprint.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EC) To inspect the past Sprint and plan for improvements in the next Sprint.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ED) To update the Product Backlog with new user stories.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EExplanation:\u003C/strong\u003E The correct answer is C) To inspect the past Sprint and plan for improvements in the next Sprint. The Sprint Retrospective is a ceremony that occurs at the end of each Sprint. It\u0027s an opportunity for the Scrum Team to reflect on the past Sprint in terms of people, relationships, processes, and tools. The team discusses what went well, what could be improved, and how to incorporate these learnings into the next Sprint. This practice is crucial for the continuous improvement ethos of Scrum. It\u0027s not about reviewing completed work for stakeholders (that\u0027s the Sprint Review), planning the next Sprint (which is part of the Sprint Planning), or updating the Product Backlog.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EQuestion: How should a Scrum Master handle a situation where a team member consistently arrives late to the Daily Scrum?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA) Assign a penalty for being late to encourage punctuality.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB) Discuss the issue privately with the team member to understand any underlying reasons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EC) Ignore the issue as long as the team member completes their tasks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ED) Bring up the issue in the Sprint Retrospective for a team discussion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EExplanation:\u003C/strong\u003E The correct answer is B) Discuss the issue privately with the team member to understand any underlying reasons. As a Scrum Master, it\u0027s important to approach such situations with empathy and understanding. Having a private discussion allows for an open conversation where the team member can share any challenges they are facing that might be causing the tardiness. This approach respects the individual\u0027s privacy and dignity while addressing the issue. It is also in line with the Scrum value of respect. Assigning penalties, ignoring the issue, or discussing it in a group setting without prior individual conversation may not be constructive and could lead to discomfort or resentment within the team.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EQuestion: What is the primary purpose of the Sprint Backlog?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA) To list all the tasks to be completed in the next Sprint.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB) To track the progress of the work during the Sprint.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EC) To provide a detailed plan for the Development Team, including how to deliver the Sprint Goal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ED) To store all future features and functions requested for the product.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EExplanation:\u003C/strong\u003E The correct answer is C) To provide a detailed plan for the Development Team, including how to deliver the Sprint Goal. The Sprint Backlog is a key Scrum artifact that includes the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint, plus a plan for delivering the product Increment and realizing the Sprint Goal. It\u0027s created during the Sprint Planning meeting and is owned by the Development Team. The Sprint Backlog makes visible all the work that the Development Team identifies as necessary to meet the Sprint Goal. While it does track progress (which aligns with option B), its primary purpose is planning and guiding the Development Team in achieving the Sprint Goal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EQuestion: In Scrum, who is responsible for prioritizing the Product Backlog?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA) The Scrum Master.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB) The Development Team.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EC) The Product Owner.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ED) The stakeholders.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EExplanation:\u003C/strong\u003E The correct answer is C) The Product Owner. The Product Owner is responsible for managing the Product Backlog, which includes clearly expressing Product Backlog items, ordering the items to best achieve goals and missions, and ensuring the visibility, transparency, and understanding of the Product Backlog. While stakeholders can influence the priority of backlog items through their inputs and feedback, it is the Product Owner who has the final say in the prioritization. The Scrum Master and the Development Team do not have this responsibility; their roles involve supporting and implementing the decisions made by the Product Owner regarding the backlog.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese sample questions with detailed explanations provide a glimpse into the depth and quality of the practice tests in our course.
