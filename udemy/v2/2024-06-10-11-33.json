For that purpose I will use the Python programming language and Flask framework.\u0026nbsp; If you are not aware of current technologies, don\u0027t worry, you should not. Believe me, the application would be extremely simple, so anyone, even a child, can understand how it works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile creating according application I will concentrate at next essential aspects:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECustom exceptions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELogging\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will explain why it is so essential to have those both things at any application and how to make it properly in order it would be helpful from a security defense perspective.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe principles which I will show you are extremely simple and can be easily propagated at any existing web application.

Current pattern of deployment can be easily used by you at production as it is rather cost effective and almost a HA solution. Though as every solution it also has some limitations, which I will discover during Terraform lectures\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt deployment section I will speak a lot about different AWS Services, that would be used for creating security defense mechanisms\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIAM policies and Security groups as restriction mechanisms to our resources\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ES3 as place for keeping our ALB and WAF logs\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECloudWath as centralized log storage and alarm system\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESNS - as mechanism for sending alarm notifications during security attacks detection\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will also touch a little bit Route 53 and Certificate manager services\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe deployed Falsk application and all AWS infrastructure around it would be intensively used as a lab environment for imitating different hacker\u2019s attacks and providing a cyber security learning process.
