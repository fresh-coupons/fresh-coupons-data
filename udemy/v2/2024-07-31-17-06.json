It\u0027s the ability to imagine someone else\u0027s pain, joy, anger in our hearts. In order for interpersonal relationships to work effectively and be satisfying, empathy is key. By making sense of what\u0027s said and not said; what\u0027s done and not done, we can make sense of everything. We\u0027re better at receiving and processing information, and finding solutions with it. Our intrinsic sense of justice is rooted in empathy, which strengthens bonds of trust. People can learn a lot about their behavior by empathizing with the negative, i.e., the emotions behind their unpleasant or destructive actions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are 5 major topics I\u0027d like to cover in this master\u0027s course\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

It identifies who has power and accountability, and who makes decisions. It is, in essence, a toolkit that enables management and the board to deal more effectively with the challenges of running a company. Corporate governance ensures that businesses have appropriate decision-making processes and controls in place so that the interests of all stakeholders (shareholders, employees, suppliers, customers and the community) are balanced. Good corporate governance can benefit investors and other stakeholders, while bad governance can lead to scandal and ruin. Governance refers to the set of rules, controls, policies, and resolutions put in place to direct corporate behavior. A board of directors is pivotal in governance, while proxy advisors and shareholders are important stakeholders who can affect governance. Communicating a company\u0027s corporate governance is a key component of community and investor relations. For instance, Apple Inc.\u0027s investor relations site profiles its corporate leadership (the executive team and board of directors) and provides information on its committee charters and governance documents, such as bylaws, stock ownership guidelines, and articles of incorporation. Most successful companies strive to have exemplary corporate governance. For many shareholders, it is not enough for a company to be profitable; it also must demonstrate good corporate citizenship through environmental awareness, ethical behavior, and other sound corporate governance practices.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/corporate-governance-us-and-uk-markets/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5621750_ba49.jpg","duration":"2.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"3,417.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Bankers, Accountants, Stakeholders of a company, Anyone who wants to learn about corporate governance"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":6,"averageValue":"4.3"},"instructors":[{"name":"EDUCBA Bridging the Gap","url":"/user/premananda-suna/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.1666665}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"EDUCBASKILLS","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/dodd-frank-act-tutorials/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5621778,"title":"Dodd-Frank Act Tutorials","shortDescription":"Learn about Dodd-Frank act and its regulations and provisions","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EDodd-Frank Act Tutorials:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis introductory course is for you to learn about the overview of Dodd-Frank act and its regulations and provisions.
