Almost all of them hire data scientists who use R. Facebook, for example, uses R to do behavioral analysis with user post data. Google uses R to assess ad effectiveness and make economic forecasts. And by the way, it\u2019s not just tech firms: R is in use at analysis and consulting firms, banks and other financial institutions, academic institutions and research labs, and pretty much everywhere else data needs analyzing and visualizing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\t2. Learning the data science basics is arguably easier in R. R has a big advantage: it was designed specifically with data manipulation and analysis in mind. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\t3. Amazing packages that make your life easier. Because R was designed with statistical analysis in mind, it has a fantastic ecosystem of packages and other resources that are great for data science. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\t4. Robust, growing community of data scientists and statisticians. As the field of data science has exploded, R has exploded with it, becoming one of the fastest-growing languages in the world (as measured by StackOverflow). That means it\u2019s easy to find answers to questions and community guidance as you work your way through projects in R.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\t5. Put another tool in your toolkit. No one language is going to be the right tool for every job. Adding R to your repertoire will make some projects easier \u2013 and of course, it\u2019ll also make you a more flexible and marketable employee when you\u2019re looking for jobs in data science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat is the difference between Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPut simply, machine learning and data mining use the same algorithms and techniques as data mining, except the kinds of predictions vary. While data mining discovers previously unknown patterns and knowledge, machine learning reproduces known patterns and knowledge\u2014and further automatically applies that information to data, decision-making, and actions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDeep learning, on the other hand, uses advanced computing power and special types of neural networks and applies them to large amounts of data to learn, understand, and identify complicated patterns. Automatic language translation and medical diagnoses are examples of deep learning.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/machine-learning-basics-classification-models-in-r/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2332706_b5c4_2.jpg","duration":"6.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"100,169.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["People pursuing a career in data science","Working Professionals beginning their Data journey","Statisticians needing more practical experience"],"tags":["Data Analysis","Logistic Regression","Machine Learning","R (programming language)"],"rating":{"count":397,"averageValue":"3.8"},"instructors":[{"name":"Start-Tech Academy","url":"/user/start-tech-academy/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.14}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"GIFTOFLEARNING","originalPrice":"\u20B93,499","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/scenario-planning-visualizing-alternative-futures/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5473268,"title":"Scenario Planning Mastery: Visualizing Alternative Futures","shortDescription":"Add a valuable strategic technique to your toolkit: Foreseeing how your future \u0022business landscape\u0022 could change","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EThe aim of this course is to help you \u003Cstrong\u003Evisualize\u003C/strong\u003E \u2013 \u003Cstrong\u003Eand understand\u003C/strong\u003E \u2013 \u003Cstrong\u003Ealternative futures that could unfold \u003C/strong\u003Efor your business, project, product, industry - or entire country.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is based on the course in scenario planning I teach in the \u003Cstrong\u003EMaster\u0027s program in Future Foresight and Planning at Rochester Institute of Technology\u003C/strong\u003E\u0027s Dubai campus \u2013 but with some extra content added which comes from my practical experience as a scenario generation workshop facilitator in over 30 countries, and from my bestselling books on this fascinating technique.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy should you want to visualize your future?\u003C/strong\u003E Because as a decision maker, you need to understand not just \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E the future will be different (we all know this), but \u003Cem\u003Ehow\u003C/em\u003E the future will be different \u2013 specifically, the future \u201Cbusiness landscape\u201D for your organization.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason this is so important is that you have to make decisions and plans today that will only play out at some point in the future \u2013 a future that right now is unknowable.\u0026nbsp; And even though we can\u0027t confidently predict exactly how the future is going to turn out, the success of your organization may depend on how good those decisions and plans are, how well-aligned they are with the way the future has actually unfolded.\u0026nbsp; Like it or not, though, you often have no choice but to make these decisions well before you know what the future terrain will in fact look like in which they will be implemented.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScenario planning\u003C/strong\u003E is a highly practical technique to foresee how this future business landscape could evolve \u2013 and potentially in different directions.

It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy use Python for Machine Learning?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnderstanding Python is one of the valuable skills needed for a career in Machine Learning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough it hasn\u2019t always been, Python is the programming language of choice for data science. Here\u2019s a brief history:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn 2016, it overtook R on Kaggle, the premier platform for data science competitions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn 2017, it overtook R on KDNuggets\u2019s annual poll of data scientists\u2019 most used tools.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn 2018, 66% of data scientists reported using Python daily, making it the number one tool for analytics professionals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMachine Learning experts expect this trend to continue with increasing development in the Python ecosystem. And while your journey to learn Python programming may be just beginning, it\u2019s nice to know that employment opportunities are abundant (and growing) as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy use R for Machine Learning?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnderstanding R is one of the valuable skills needed for a career in Machine Learning. Below are some reasons why you should learn Machine learning in R\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. It\u2019s a popular language for Machine Learning at top tech firms. Almost all of them hire data scientists who use R. Facebook, for example, uses R to do behavioral analysis with user post data. Google uses R to assess ad effectiveness and make economic forecasts. And by the way, it\u2019s not just tech firms: R is in use at analysis and consulting firms, banks and other financial institutions, academic institutions and research labs, and pretty much everywhere else data needs analyzing and visualizing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Learning the data science basics is arguably easier in R. R has a big advantage: it was designed specifically with data manipulation and analysis in mind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Amazing packages that make your life easier. Because R was designed with statistical analysis in mind, it has a fantastic ecosystem of packages and other resources that are great for data science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Robust, growing community of data scientists and statisticians. As the field of data science has exploded, R has exploded with it, becoming one of the fastest-growing languages in the world (as measured by StackOverflow). That means it\u2019s easy to find answers to questions and community guidance as you work your way through projects in R.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Put another tool in your toolkit. No one language is going to be the right tool for every job. Adding R to your repertoire will make some projects easier \u2013 and of course, it\u2019ll also make you a more flexible and marketable employee when you\u2019re looking for jobs in data science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat is the difference between Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPut simply, machine learning and data mining use the same algorithms and techniques as data mining, except the kinds of predictions vary. While data mining discovers previously unknown patterns and knowledge, machine learning reproduces known patterns and knowledge\u2014and further automatically applies that information to data, decision-making, and actions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDeep learning, on the other hand, uses advanced computing power and special types of neural networks and applies them to large amounts of data to learn, understand, and identify complicated patterns.
