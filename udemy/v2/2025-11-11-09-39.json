And then we are going to build a full authentication system from scratch. While building this system I am going to introduce you to hashing and dehashing passwords. And then, we are going to build general and cool features inside our own app. It\u0027s going to be mainly on selecting and placing data. The next step is showing how a booking system is created professionally and then we are going to move to one of the most crucial things in this course and that\u0027s Processing the payment with Paypal in the easiest yet most efficient way possible. And then, we are going to build a search form to search for booking deals with multiple inputs. After this, we are going to move to the next part and that\u0027s the admin panel. In the admin panel, we are going to finish up every part of our website. We are going to complete the admins, countries, cities, and book parts. So it\u0027s going to be fun!!
