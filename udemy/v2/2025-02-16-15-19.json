The conference is credited with helping to define the field of AI and to set the agenda for future research.","Artificial Intelligence \u201CAI\u201D is a complex field that needs the ability of people from diverse disciplines to work together. As an example, manufacturing autonomous vehicles like self-driving cars requires the work of people from different fields, such as AI Researchers, Automotive Engineers, and Computer Vision Researchers.  AI Researchers develop algorithms that enable self-driving cars to perceive their surroundings, make decisions, and control their movements. Automotive Engineers develop the hardware and software systems that are needed to implement these algorithms, and Computer Vision Researchers develop new techniques for enabling self-driving cars to see and understand the world.","What is Machine Learning?  Machine Learning is a type of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that allows computers to learn from data without explicit programming. In other words, machine learning algorithms can recognize patterns and make predictions based on data, without getting a command. This enables computers to learn new tasks and improve their performance over time without human intervention.","Where is Machine Learning used?  Machine learning is in use by a wide range of applications, including email filtering, Social Media Personalization, Image Recognition, Speech Recognition, fraud detection, Text prediction, Product recommendation, medical diagnosis, Healthcare Personalization, Traffic Prediction.","Neural networks are a type of machine learning algorithm that is inspired by the structure and function of the human brain.  Neural networks can learn complex patterns from data.  Neural networks have been successfully used in areas such as natural language processing.","Deep Learning is a type of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers.  Each layer consists of multiple nodes that can perform diverse tasks. This allows deep learning models to learn more complex patterns from data.  Deep learning has been used to achieve significant results in a wide range of tasks, including image recognition, speech recognition, and machine translation."],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":563,"averageValue":"4.1"},"instructors":[{"name":"MTF Institute of Management, Technology and Finance","url":"/user/mtfinstitute/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.2}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"5091BC4AD3B0C81A8F4A","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"2 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/mastering-bard-ai-googles-versatile-language-model/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5755586,"title":"Mastering Gemini AI: Google\u0027s Versatile Language Model","shortDescription":"Explore AI, Multilingual Support, Content Creation, \u0026 Coding","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EDive into the world of artificial intelligence with \u0022Mastering Bard AI: Google\u0027s Versatile Language Model\u0022.
