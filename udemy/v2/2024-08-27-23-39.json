The course starts right from the basics, where we explore various cloud computing service models. This includes infrastructure as a service, platform as a service, and software as a service. From there students gain hands-on experience with creating and administering remote virtual instances, complete with Ubuntu, Apache, MariaDB, and PHP. Students will learn the difference between popular web servers like Apache and NGINX, along with a detailed overview of various database management systems. This includes both SQL and NoSQL databases, in addition to database transaction standards such as ACID and CAP Theorem. In addition to a theoretical deep dive, the course demonstrates how to install, configure, and secure LAMP stack on Ubuntu for hosting dynamic, database driven web apps. We offer a detailed segment on server security, where students will configure both software and network firewalls for their instance using strict firewall policies, UFW and custom SSH ports. At this stage students will also learn to scale their servers both vertically and horizontally using application load balancers. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe second half of the course provides a comprehensive guide to Amazon Web Services.

From there, we take a deep dive into AWS Identity and Access management for enhanced account security, and the management of user accounts for various AWS services. Here we explore IAM User management and permissions, IAM Groups, IAM Policies, and access key rotation. Following the IAM section, we\u2019ll jump into the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) service. In this module students lean to deploy virtual instances on AWS using Amazon Machine Images, Elastic IPs, and Launch Templates.

A successful manager is now expected to act as a leader, a mentor, and a coach, guiding their team members towards individual and collective success. This paradigm shift highlights the significance of coaching techniques in the realm of managerial responsibilities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Transformation of Managerial Roles\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEvolving Leadership Expectations\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe traditional image of a manager as a stern authority figure has given way to a more holistic view of leadership.

This shift stems from the recognition that employees perform at their best when they feel valued, supported, and empowered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe evolution of leadership expectations can be traced back to the changing dynamics of the modern workplace. In the past, managers were primarily responsible for enforcing rules and ensuring productivity. However, as organizations began to realize that employee engagement and satisfaction were crucial for success, a transformation in managerial roles ensued.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday, managers are not just tasked with overseeing tasks and projects; they are expected to inspire and empower their teams. This shift is partly a response to the changing nature of work itself.

We\u0027ll explore how coaching techniques, such as active listening, constructive feedback, and goal-setting, can empower managers to become effective leaders who inspire and guide their teams towards excellence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECoaching is not a one-size-fits-all approach; it is a dynamic and personalized method of leadership. Effective coaches adapt their style to the needs and preferences of individual team members. They actively listen to understand the unique challenges and aspirations of each employee, fostering a sense of trust and rapport.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMoreover, coaching is not merely about providing solutions but guiding employees to discover answers themselves. This approach instills a sense of ownership and accountability in team members.
