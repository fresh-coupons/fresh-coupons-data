The fingers of both hands are used to close and open the holes. It has a blowing hole near one end, and eight closely placed finger holes. The instrument comes in various sizes. The venu is also a highly respected instrument and those who play it are expected to appreciate it, for it is considered a gift to be able to play it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u003Cem\u003Evenu\u003C/em\u003E is capable of producing two and half octaves with the help of over-blowing and cross fingering. The flute is like the human voice in that it is monophonous and also has a typical two and half octave sound reproduction. Sliding the fingers on and off the holes allows for production of variety of Gamakas, important in the performance of raga-based music.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHistory of Carnatic Flute\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe flute (\u003Cem\u003EVenu\u003C/em\u003E) finds great mention in \u003Cstrong\u003EIndian mythology\u003C/strong\u003E and folklore having been listed as among the 3 original instruments meant for music along with the human sound and Veena (\u003Cem\u003Evaani-veena-venu\u003C/em\u003E).However it is strange that there is no name mentioned for the typical flute that the Lord plays.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u003Cem\u003Evenu\u003C/em\u003E is associated with the \u003Cstrong\u003EHindu god Krishna\u003C/strong\u003E, who is often depicted playing it. This kind of flute is mainly used in \u003Cstrong\u003ESouth India\u003C/strong\u003E. Lord Vishnu is portrayed as \u003Cem\u003ESri Venugopala\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EVenu\u003C/strong\u003E had not been a part of the Carnatic classical music until the pioneering innovations of \u003Cstrong\u003EShri Sharaba Shastri\u003C/strong\u003E and later revisions and updates on his design by \u003Cstrong\u003EShri T.R. Mahalingam\u003C/strong\u003E (fondly called Flute Mali). Due to the underlying physics of sound production, flutes have a natural \u0022cut\u0022 or a discontinuity when going from the lowest note to the highest note. This discontinuity appears between the notes \u0022\u003Cem\u003Ega\u003C/em\u003E\u0022 and \u0022\u003Cem\u003Ema\u003C/em\u003E\u0022 on a Carnatic flute and between \u0022\u003Cem\u003EMa\u003C/em\u003E\u0022 and \u0022\u003Cem\u003EPa\u003C/em\u003E\u0022 for a Hindustani flute (mainly because of the fingering technique differences). In order to adapt the flute to Carnatic Music, certain modifications were necessary such as the addition of the 7th hole, usage of thicker walled bamboos, the technique of lifting the head to change the angle of embouchure when shifting between \u0022ga\u0022 and \u0022ma\u0022 notes. These innovations enabled artists to perform the Carnatic ragas with all the necessary Gamakas and ornamentations without losing the \u0022Bhaava\u0022 of the raga.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the Hindustani style, it is known as \u003Cstrong\u003EBansuri (\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E6 Holes\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E)\u003C/strong\u003E.

It assumes that you\u0027re new to the language, so it gets you started with basic functionality such as creating functions, creating variables, and calling these lines of code from your standard HTML pages. It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are practicals of:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E* Javascript Course Contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Array\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Variables\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Functions\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Objects\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Control Statements\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Cookies\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Loop statements\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESee you inside the course\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-practicals-crash-course/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4200228_c917_2.jpg","duration":"38 total mins","enrolledStudentsCount":"116,637.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["For Javascript  Programming Beginners","For People New to Javascript","For People Who want to learn Javascript Fundamentals and later Transition into Web Development"],"tags":["JavaScript"],"rating":{"count":1494,"averageValue":"4.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"PROPER DOT INSTITUTE","url":"/user/vivek-dahibhate-2/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"155BF25A416F3FAA453D","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"2 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-course-learn-from-beginner-to-advanced/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5854076,"title":"Complete Python Course: Learn From Beginner To Advanced","shortDescription":"Complete Python Course From Beginner To Advanced","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the Complete Python Course: Learn From Beginner To Advanced!
