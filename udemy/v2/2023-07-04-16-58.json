It uses a different paradigm than the commonly use SQL\u0026nbsp;database systems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Redis database can store diverse kinds of data (strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets, bitmaps), and support different kinds of operations (hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets, bitmaps) on the data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is written in ANSI C and can be used on all major operating systems. The Redis database has been running since December 2007 and in the last 5 years it has been downloaded more than 1.5 million times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a developer, I have used Redis on a number of projects. It is an excellent choice for projects that require ultra-fast data access. Redis is in-memory, which means that it stores all its data in memory, so writing to Redis is fast.

The term digital forensics was originally used as a synonym for \u003Cstrong\u003Ecomputer forensics\u003C/strong\u003E but has expanded to cover investigation of all devices capable of storing digital data. With roots in the personal computing revolution of the late 1970s and early 1980s, the discipline evolved in a haphazard manner during the 1990s, and it was not until the early 21st century that national policies emerged.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDigital forensics investigations have a variety of applications. The most common is to support or refute a hypothesis before criminal or civil courts. Criminal cases involve the alleged breaking of laws that are defined by legislation and that are enforced by the police and prosecuted by the state, such as theft and assault against the person. Civil cases on the other hand deal with protecting the rights and property of individuals (often associated with family disputes) but may also be concerned with contractual disputes between commercial entities where a form of digital forensics referred to as electronic discovery (discovery) may be involved\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring the 1980s very few specialized digital forensic tools existed, and consequently investigators often performed live analysis on media, examining computers from within the operating system using existing sysadmin tools to extract evidence. This practice carried the risk of modifying data on the disk, either inadvertently or otherwise, which led to claims of evidence tampering. A number of tools were created during the early 1990s to address the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDigital forensics is commonly used in both criminal law and private investigation. Traditionally it has been associated with criminal law, where evidence is collected to support or oppose a hypothesis before the courts. As with other areas of forensics this is often a part of a wider investigation spanning a number of disciplines. In some cases, the collected evidence is used as a form of intelligence gathering, used for other purposes than court proceedings (for example to locate, identify or halt other crimes). As a result, intelligence gathering is sometimes held to a less strict forensic standard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you enroll in our Digital Forensics Masterclass | Forensic Science 2023 DFMC, you\u0027ll not only learn about the fundamentals of digital forensics, but so much more!

These players can be divided roughly into two groups: those that are members of the innate immune system team and those that are part of the adaptive immune system. Importantly, these two groups work together to provide a powerful defense against invaders. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImmunology is a difficult subject for several reasons. First, there are lots of details, and sometimes these details get in \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe way of understanding the concepts. To get around this problem, we\u2019re going to concentrate on the big picture. It \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewill be easy for you to find the details somewhere else. Another difficulty in learning immunology is that there \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eis an exception to every rule. Immunologists love these exceptions, because they give clues as to how the immune \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esystem functions. But for now, we\u2019re just going to learn the rules. Oh sure, we\u2019ll come upon exceptions from time \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eto time, but we won\u2019t dwell on them. Our goal is to exam-ine the immune system, stripped to its essence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA third difficulty in studying immunology is that our knowledge of the immune system is still evolving. As \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyou\u2019ll see, there are many unanswered questions, and some of the things that seem true today will be proven \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efalse tomorrow. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe term \u201Cimmunology\u003C/strong\u003E\u201D is derived from Latin word \u201Cimmunis\u201D means exempt, i.e., protection from infectious diseases. Extensive work on bacteriology and pathology made their respective workers to find methods to develop resistance against infectious diseases in the latter half of 19th and beginning of 20th century. Although the history of immunology is about 100 years old, cellular immunology dates back to the 1950s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ewhy is immunology so important?\u003C/strong\u003E The immune system has involvement in almost all fields related to health and disease. Infections continue to confront human health and well-being on a global scale. Inflammation contributes to the \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Elung, heart and joint diseases, and diabetes mellitus; cancers have to evade immune surveillance, and immune dysregulation leads to allergies that are increasingly prevalent across the world. Only improved understanding of the \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emechanisms by which microbes, allergens, and tumor cells cause disease will result in the development of diagnostic, therapeutic, and preventative strategies to combat this threat.However, we are only beginning the voyage of immunology, and there is much we still need to research and understand. The study of basic immunology may provide students with an opportunity to relate the findings of fundamental sciscientific investigations to clinical problems\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ehistory\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBabylonian Epic of Gilgamesh (2000 B. C.) records the presence of pestilence and diseases. The study of Immunology stemmed out from the Thucydides\u2019 description of individuals who recovered from the plague in Athens. Those individuals, who had already contracted the disease, recovered and became \u201Cimmune.\u201D Variolation was practiced for many years in China. The process involved exposing healthy people to the material derived from the lesions caused by the disease by either putting it under the skin or, more often, inserting powdered scabs from smallpox pustules into the nose. However, that occasionally resulted in death because there was no standardization of the inoculum. Variolation, later, became popular \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ein England, mainly due to the efforts of Lady Mary Wortley Montague and the American colonies. In 1796, Jenner inoculated James Phipps with the material obtained from a cowpox lesion, which appeared on the hand of a \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edairymaid, and he inoculated the experimental subject with smallpox about six weeks later, without producing disease [1]. In 1875, Robert Koch was able to show the presence of anthrax causing bacteria in the lymph nodes of a dead rabbit that was earlier inoculated with the blood of a diseased animal [2]. In a serendipitous discovery, Pasteur was able to attenuate the virulent chicken cholera bacillus and coined the term vaccination. Later, he developed first viable vaccine for anthrax and rabies while Robert Koch studied hypersensitivity in tuberculosis. Although many consider Louis Pasteur the \u201Cfather of \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eimmunology,\u201D it is due to his and Koch\u2019s efforts that firmly established the historical germ theory of disease. Then, various scientists contributed to the development of the concept of cellular and humoral immunity. While working on the development of digestive organ in starfish larvae, Metchnikoff became a leading proponent of the \u201CCellularists.\u201D He believed that phagocytes, not antibodies, played the leading role in immunity. Emil von Behring and Kitasato demonstrated the transfer of immunity against Diphtheria by a soluble \u201Canti-toxin\u201D in the blood\u0026nbsp; whereby, Paul Ehrlich predicted the existence of immune bodies (antibodies) and side-chains from which they arise (receptors). Ehrlich suggested that antigens interact with receptors borne by cells, resulting in the secretion of excess receptors (antibodies).the supporters of alternative theory, i.e., \u201CHumoralists,\u201D believed that a soluble substance in the body was responsible for mediating immunity \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E OVERVIEW OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPHYSICAL BARRIERS\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eimmunological mechanisms\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETHE INNATE IMMUNE SYSTEM\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETHE ADAPTIVE IMMUNE SYSTEM\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eorgan of immune system\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecells of immune system\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAntigen\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMacrophage\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhat is immune response ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eimmunoglobulin\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eimmunotolerance\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehistocompatibility\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eimmunotherapy\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecytokines\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecomplement system\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegulation of immune response\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eimmunity to infection\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etransplantation immunology\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eautoimmune diseases\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehypersensitivity \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eimmunization\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etumor immunology\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eimmunodiagnostics\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/immunology-step-by-step/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5080764_72e0_2.jpg","duration":"6 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"2,710.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Students who are considering or attending medical school or other health-related professional programs (nursing, pharmacy, PA) \u2013 including those at the high school, undergraduate, and postgraduate levels Professionals looking to improve knowledge for work on health care applications, projects, and research Curious learners with sufficient prerequisites (biology, chemistry, physics) who want to know more"],"tags":["Immunology"],"rating":{"count":3,"averageValue":"2.2"},"instructors":[{"name":"Mohamed AL ashram","url":"/user/mohamed-taha-288/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":3.5}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"4D8ACADD91952B0FC6AE","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-photoshop-course-zero-to-hero/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":2921100,"title":"Learn Photoshop From Scratch - A Beginner\u0027s Guide","shortDescription":"The complete photoshop course.

Now you get the idea why besides learning python it doesn\u2019t require any programming background so that\u2019s why it\u2019s popular amongst developers as well. Python has simpler syntax similar to the English language and also the syntax allows developers to write programs with fewer lines of code. Since it is open-source there are many libraries available that make developers\u2019 jobs easy ultimately results in high productivity. They can easily focus on business logic and Its demanding skills in the digital era where information is available in large data sets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis course is designed to not only teach you Python, but to also give you a real feel of how to use Python in a real enviornment.

Open source software in general, and JavaScript in particular, can seem like a place where boom and bust is the rule of law: rapid growth before everyone moves on to the next big thing. But Node.js is different. Although it certainly couldn\u2019t be described as new, and it\u2019s growth hasn\u2019t been dramatic by any measure, over the last few years it has managed to push itself forward as one of the most widely used JavaScript tools on the planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you want to learn Node.js?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPopularity, however can only tell you so much. The key question, if you\u2019re reading this, is whether \u003Cem\u003Eyou\u003C/em\u003E should learn Node.js. So, to help you decide if it\u2019s time to learn the JavaScript library, here\u2019s a list of the biggest reasons why you should start learning Node.js. Okay, let\u2019s get the obvious one out of the way first: \u003Cem\u003ENode.js is worth learning because it allows you to write JavaScript on the server\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis has arguably transformed the way we think about JavaScript. Whereas in the past it was a language specifically written on the client, backed by the likes of PHP and Java, it\u2019s now a language that you can use across your application. We know by now that Node.js is flexible. But it\u2019s important to recognise that its flexibility means it can be used for a wide range of different purposes. Yes, the library\u2019s community are predominantly building applications for the web, but it\u2019s also a useful tool for those working in ops or infrastructure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is because Node.js is a great tool for developing other development tools.

Development of Angular applications involves usage of Typescript, which is a superset of Javascript, along with HTML, CSS etc. The code written in Typescript compiles to Javascript and is rendered in the browser. Angular is one of the \u003Cstrong\u003Emost popular Javascript frameworks \u003C/strong\u003Efor building web applications. There have been three popular versions of Angular to date -- Angular 1 (also known as AngularJS), followed by Angular 2, which was succeeded by Angular 4.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAngularJS and Angular 2 are very different from each other. However, Angular 2 and Angular 4 share many similarities. Angular 4 also has backward compatibility with Angular 2, that is, the code written in Angular 2 will work fine in Angular 4.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou must be wondering that why did Angular 3 not get released? Well, there were some versioning issues with the modules internally. Hence, the Angular team decided to skip the release of version 3 of Angular and directly went on to release Angular 4. Version 5 and 6 of Angular have also released recently, and Angular 7 will be released in September or October 2018. Since Google has pledged to upgrade Angular twice every year, new versions of Angular come up frequently. However, Angular 4 is as of now the most popular among them and is widely used. All the Angular versions from 2 and above are backward compatible. Single Page Applications are a type of web application that loads a single HTML page, and the page is updated dynamically according to the interaction of the user with the web app. Single Page Applications, also known as SPAs, can communicate with the back-end servers without refreshing the full webpage, for loading data in the application. SPAs provide better user experience as no one likes to wait too long for reloading of the full webpage. Angular supports the development of SPAs, and hence is worth learning!\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/a-hands-on-angular-course-learn-from-scratch/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2956340_9691.jpg","duration":"1 total hour","enrolledStudentsCount":"9,701.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Any one who has background about html and javascript"],"tags":["AngularJS"],"rating":{"count":39,"averageValue":"2.8"},"instructors":[{"name":"Learn Pro","url":"/user/pronoy-11/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":2.65}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"90B76A73332AA904FB66","originalPrice":"\u20B96,500","discountedPrice":"\u20B9449","expirationText":"5 hours","discountPercentage":93}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/leetcode-coding-interview-question-solution-explanation/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":3360526,"title":"LeetCode in Java: Algorithms Coding Interview Questions","shortDescription":"Ace your next coding interview by solving essential coding interview questions and get an offer from big tech company.","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to \u0022LeetCode in Java: Algorithms Coding Interview Questions\u0022 course!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this course, \u003Cstrong\u003Eyou\u0027ll have a\u003C/strong\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003Edetailed, step by step explanation of classical hand-picked LeetCode Problems \u003C/strong\u003Ewhere you\u0027ll learn about the optimum ways to solve technical coding interview question. \u003Cstrong\u003EThis is the course I wish I had when I was preparing myself for the interviews. \u003C/strong\u003EThis course comes with a \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E30-day money-back guarantee.

Java\u0027s extensive support for this protocol is demonstrated, including \u003Cstrong\u003ENIO\u003C/strong\u003E support, and how UDP can support streaming media. We will also cover in our udemy course Network Scalability, I will explain how, as more demands are placed on a server,\u0026nbsp; systems need to scale to address these demands. Several threading techniques supporting this need are demonstrated, including thread pools, futures, and the \u003Cstrong\u003ENIO\u0027\u003C/strong\u003Es selector. We will also cover in our udemy course Network Security, you\u2019ll learn how applications need to protect against a variety of threats. This is supported in Java using encryption and secure hashing techniques. Symmetric and asymmetric encryption techniques are illustrated. In addition, the use of \u003Cstrong\u003ETLS/SSL\u003C/strong\u003E is demonstrated. We will also cover in our udemy course covers how Java applications may need to exchange information with other applications that are written in different languages. The issues that impact an application\u0027s interoperability are examined, including byte order. Communication between different implementations is demonstrated using sockets and middleware.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll the Java program communications over the network are done at the application layer.
