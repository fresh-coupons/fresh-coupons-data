It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E*\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E javascript course contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript introduction\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript array\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript variables\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript functions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript objects\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript control statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript cookies\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript loop statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript data structures\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript error handling\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript regular expressions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESection 4- python programming language.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis course section provides an introduction to programming and the python language. students are introduced to core python programming concepts like conditionals, loops, variables, and functions. this section includes an overview of the various python aspects.

In the introduction session, you will learn several aspects where AI can be utilised to create news videos, such as converting news scripts to audio and producing animated news anchors to present the news. Then, you will continue by getting to know several news sources like Google News, AP News, and Reuters as well as learning how to check the potential bias and reliability of the news. This part is very crucial to make sure the news you are planning to cover are actually factual.

Therefore, anybody can be an independent journalist nowadays and it is very possible to combine it with content creation. The advancement of artificial intelligence technologies in the past couple years also contributed very significantly where today you can even create news channels and upload videos where you are reporting news without showing your face since you can replace it with AI powered news anchors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow are things that you can expect to learn from the course:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to automate news videos creation process using AI\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to analyse and check if the news is unbiased, neutral, accurate, and factual\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to convert news articles from Google News, AP News, and Reuters into news scripts using ChatGPT\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to customise AI powered news anchors avatars\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to create a hyper realistic news videos with AI powered news anchor using HeyGen\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to create a hyper realistic news videos with AI powered news anchor using HourOne\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to create a hyper realistic news videos with AI powered news anchor using Paradiso AI\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to create breaking news intro using Canva\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to add subtitles automatically and edit news videos using Veed IO\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFull comprehensive analysis on which social media platform is the best to host your content videos: comparing Yotube vs Tiktok\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn several different strategies to monetise news videos and how to potentially turn this side hustle into a news channel business\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/automating-journalism-make-news-channel-with-ai-news-anchor/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5489852_b307.jpg","duration":"2.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"399.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Journalists who are interested to use AI to automate their news content creation process","People who are interested in starting a news channel or news agency"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":0,"averageValue":"0.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"Christ Raharja","url":"/user/christ-raharja/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":0}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"599C1794466BC765765E","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/merchandising-retail-business-retail-management/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5345256,"title":"Master Course : Merchandising, Retail Business \u0026 Management","shortDescription":"Retail business, Retail business management, Merchandising, Super market management, Retail business strategy","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EMaster course in merchandising, retail business and retail management\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHOW DOES MERCHANDISING WORK?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA merchandising activity is anything that helps promote and sell products to customers.

This is basically an extensive project based course where you will be guided step by step on how to build a cryptocurrency price tracking website using Wordpress alongside with Cryptocurrency Widgets plugin which is a Wordpress plugin that was specifically designed to create cryptocurrency market price tracker just like Coinmarketcap and Coingecko. In addition, Cryptocurrency Widgets plugin is also supported by CoinGecko API, therefore, the price data that will be displayed on the Wordpress website will be reliable and most up to date data. In the introduction session, you will learn the basic fundamentals of Wordpress and get to know more about Cryptocurrency Widgets which is the plugin that will be utilised in this project. Then, you will also get to know the general overview of the project that we are going to build as well as all features that will be included. Before getting to the main section of the course, you will be guided step by step on how to set up all necessary tools like creating an account on Taste WP which is Wordpress testing platform that we are going to use and also installing the plugin that we need for this project. Once we are ready, you will learn step by step on how to build the crypto price tracker website from scratch, we will go over how to import the price columns and how to change the currency. After the website has been built, we are going to be conducting testing to make sure that the crypto price tracking website has been fully functioning and also easy to use from the user\u2019s perspective. There will be four main testing objectives that will be emphasised in this course, those are functionality testing, user experience testing, compatibility testing, and performance testing. Once the website has been tested and passed all the required criteria, you are going to get to know more about affordable domain and hosting options. Hopefully, this particular section will enable you to make informed decisions about which hosting service you want to use. At the end of the course, you will also learn how to monetise your cryptocurrency price tracking website, we will go over several strategies such as displaying ads, premium ICO, and subscription based model.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, before getting into the course, we need to ask ourselves this question: why should we learn or even build a cryptocurrency price tracking website? Well, there are many answers to that question but in my opinion, cryptocurrency, web 3.0, and blockchain have been growing very rapidly in the past few years, hence, the demand for crypto tracking websites will always be there. If you were thinking about creating the exact clone of Coinmarketcap or Coingecko, then most likely, it will not work since they have already dominated the market a long time even before you started however if you have new creative ideas and try to combine those innovations with crypto price tracker system in your website, I am pretty sure you have a good chance to succeed. Besides crypto, learning how to build and design websites using Wordpress is also a high demand skill to have in today\u2019s market as more and more companies are transforming toward massive scale digitalisation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow are things that you can expect to learn from the course:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearning the basic fundamentals of Wordpress \u0026amp; Cryptocurrency Widgets plugin\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearning how to build Wordpress website using TasteWP\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearning how to create a fully animated cryptocurrency price ticker on Wordpress\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearning how to add cryptocurrency price list with detailed information, such as market cap, supply, transaction volume, etc\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearning how to add multi-currency tabs on Wordpress\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConducting testing on the website with four main testing objectives, those are functionality testing, user experience testing, performance testing, and compatibility testing\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGetting to know more about affordable domain \u0026amp; hosting provider options\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearning how to integrate ads to Wordpress website\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearning how to monetise cryptocurrency price tracking website\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/building-cryptocurrency-price-tracker-website-with-wordpress/","imageUri":"https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5484248_8459.jpg","duration":"2 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"2,158.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["People who are interested in building cryptocurrency price tracking website","People who are interested in building \u0026 designing Wordpress website"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":0,"averageValue":"0.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"Christ Raharja","url":"/user/christ-raharja/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":0}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"51D1D0919F3F482473E4","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"1 day","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/intro-to-chatgpt-the-essential-skills-for-getting-started/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5065878,"title":"Intro to ChatGPT: The Essential Skills for Getting Started","shortDescription":"Master the Art of Writing with ChatGPT AI: Boost Your Blogging, Sales Copy, and More","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EAre you interested in gaining a deeper understanding of ChatGPT, the highly advanced language model developed by OpenAI?

Chickens were brought to Sumer In Thebes, Egypt, the tomb of Haremhab, built about 1420 BCE, shows a depiction of a man carrying bowls of ostrich eggs and other large eggs,\u0026nbsp; arrived in Greece around 800 BCE, where the quail had been the primary source of eggs IN ancient Rome, eggs were preserved using a number of methods, and meals often started with an egg course The dried egg industry developed in the 19th century, before the rise of the frozen egg industry. In 1878, a company in St. Louis, Missouri started to transform egg yolk and white into a light-brown, meal-like substance by using a drying process.\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;intensive poultry production only began in the 20th century. Indeed, the past 100 years have seen an impressive growth, chiefly in the production of chickens and eggs, turkeys, ducks, and geese. It is the advent of vaccination for conditions such as Marek\u2019s disease, in addition to preproducing good quality day-old chicks starts with the breeder flock. Not only is the quality of the egg important, but also the health and nutritional status of the breeders are having an impact on day-old markable improvements in nutrition, genetics, and management, that has allowed the poultry industry to quickly develop since the late 1960s\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; In general we can divide the factors associated with chick quality in two categories: EGG RELATED FACTORS hatchery and brooding management factors (egg handling , incubation, chick processing and placement SOURCES OF CHICKENS Primary breeding companies supply the breed performance These white hybrid layers are capable of laying 324 eggs per hen housed at 72 weeks of age with a feed conversion of 3.04 pounds of feed per dozen or 1.91 kg feed per kg of egg.der stock chickens for various breeder/hatchery companies who then supply the day-old pullet chicks to be grown into laying hens housing system feeding program in general\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;lighting program\u0026nbsp; economy of layer farm indices layer health management vaccination program suggested vaccination program spray vaccine onovo vaccine hatchary vaccine fowl pox vaccine cleaning disinfection receiving baby chicks\u0026nbsp; automation in layer farm egg collection manure removal flock following rearing table postmortem\u0026nbsp; procedures serology how to take blood sample how to make Elisa test\u0026nbsp; Elisa software\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/master-layer-farm-management-the-business-of-millionaires/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4355500_374e.jpg","duration":"5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"16,412.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["any one interested in poultry business","begginer in business world"],"tags":["Management Skills"],"rating":{"count":54,"averageValue":"4.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"Mohamed AL ashram","url":"/user/mohamed-taha-288/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.3}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"140E505BE5E210421A5A","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/microsoft-sentinel-comprehensive-guide-to-cybersecurity/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5496108,"title":"Microsoft Sentinel Comprehensive Guide to Cybersecurity","shortDescription":"Microsoft Sentinel: Navigating Cloud-Native Security Excellence, Azure Sentinel Tools, Techniques, \u0026 Technologies (2023)","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the comprehensive journey of \u0027\u003Cstrong\u003EMastering Cloud-Native Security Operations with Microsoft Sentinel\u003C/strong\u003E.\u0027 In today\u0027s ever-evolving digital landscape, safeguarding data, applications, and infrastructure is paramount.
