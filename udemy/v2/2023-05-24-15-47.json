In this course you will learn how to use JavaScript along with two powerful JavaScript libraries to build dynamic, interactive web pages. We start with introducing students to the document object model (DOM) which defines the logical structure of HTML documents. From there we dive into JavaScript to demonstrate various methods in which DOM elements can be manipulated to add interactivity to static components. The JavaScript section starts right from the basics, which includes JavaScript placement, and data output. From there we move on to variable declaration, arithmetic operations, operator precedence, data types, and objects. Once the foundations are covered, we move on to more complex operations using Arrays, Conditional Statements, JavaScript comparison operators, booleans and loops. Here students will learn to unleash the true power of JavaScript to render different outcomes based on user interaction. We will explore the use of functions to efficiently handle repetitive tasks and JavaScript events to handle output based on actions and occurrences. The section will conclude with a hands-on project where students will implement their knowledge to build a web based photo gallery and background color changer.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn the second section of this course, students will learn to work with jQuery - a powerful JavaScript library designed to simplify HTML DOM tree traversal and manipulation. jQuery is ultra lightweight, feature rich, and cross-platform compatible. It\u2019s one of the easiest libraries to work with for building out JavaScript features on an HTML web page. jQuery is excellent for event handling, CSS animations, and Ajax integration for asynchronous UI state changes. Similar to the JavaScript section, the jQuery module begins with the foundations. This includes instructions on embedding jQuery to a web page, and an intro into jQuery syntax. Students will learn to work with jQuery selectors, events, and toggling. From there we dive into animations using fades, slides, and the jQuery animate function. Students also learn about chaining, draggable objects, callback functions, the get content method, toggling classes, and filtering. By the end of the jQuery module, you will know how to build stunning animated web pages with ease.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn the last section of this course we\u2019ll explore React - a cutting edge JavaScript library for building state-of-the art user interface components. You\u2019ve likely seen React in action on some of the hottest web apps developed by fortune 500 companies. For example, Netflix, Facebook, and AirBnB all use React for their front-end UI. As a matter of fact, React was developed by Meta alongside a community of independent developers. Until this day, React remains free and open-source so it has plenty of support and documentation. Unlike jQuery which interacts with the document object model directly, React works through a \u201Cvirtual\u201D DOM. React is unaware of changes made to the DOM outside of React and determines updates based on its own internal representations. React is best for creating reusable code blocks for UI components and layering them on top of each other to minimize the number of times the DOM needs to be re-rendering on state changes. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe React section of this course starts off with a hands-on project where you\u2019ll learn how to work with functional React components, props, Callback functions, OnClick Events, and the React State hook to build a fully functional calculator. From there we will dive into project number two, where you will build a connect-4 clone. Here we will cover more intermediate concepts including passing props, destructuring, passing arguments to click events, various styling methods, and handling callbacks. You will also learn about the React key property, React lifecycle events, and conditional rendering. By the end you will have built a complete multi and single player connect-4 game board with built-in AI capabilities. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn the final section of the course we further unleash the power of React by building out a complete e-commerce site with multiple product categories, a product showcase, shopping cart feature, and much more. Here, we introduce a number of integral new concepts including: JSON server, Fetch API, and installing React router. These essential building blocks will be used to render the product categories, style the product list, and configure the product details page. From there we dive into styled components, refactoring the shop layout, and exploring the concept of \u201Ccontext\u201D in React. In the final stages of the project students will configure the shopping cart basket, and the checkout feature. We will also implement a product search feature, followed by in-depth exercises on validating input forms in React.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAs you can see this course covers a tremendous bit of ground. Best of all it\u2019s co-authored by Tim Maclachlan - a renowned senior full-stack developer with over 20 years of commercial development experience. As a multi-faceted developer, Tim specializes in algorithmic, analytical and mobile development. To date, he\u2019s written hundreds of applications and worked in a number of industries from commercial aviation and military, to banking and finance. Tim has a genuine passion for teaching others how to become better coders and looks forward to interacting with his students.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWith that said, we hope you\u2019re just as excited about this course as we are, if so - hit that enroll button and let\u2019s get started.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-javascript-jquery-and-react-bootcamp-hands-on/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4789948_a375.jpg","duration":"13 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"29,058.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Students interested in working with Popular JavaScript Libraries","Students interested in Building Interactive UI Components using React and jQuery","Students interested in Mastering Front-End Development using JavaScript"],"tags":["JavaScript","jQuery","React JS"],"rating":{"count":127,"averageValue":"4.4"},"instructors":[{"name":"YouAccel Training","url":"/user/youaccel/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.442623}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"YOUACCEL57611","originalPrice":"\u20B91,999","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/build-and-deploy-responsive-websites-on-aws-using-html-css/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5037480,"title":"Build and Deploy Responsive Websites on AWS using HTML \u0026 CSS","shortDescription":"AWS Foundations | IAM | Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) | AWS Storage (EC2) | ELB | ASG | Route 53 | HTML | CSS","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EThis course provides a comprehensive introduction to Amazon Web Services (AWS) and web development fundamentals.

Some of the most well known examples of organizations using React for their front-end include Netflix, Facebook, and Airbnb. Developed and maintained by Meta along with a community of independent developers, React remains free and open-source. React is a component based library built entirely on JavaScript, which makes it perfect for designing complex UI\u2019s. With React, developers can build encapsulated components that efficiently manage their own state and render UI updates specifically when data changes. For example, think of the automated content refresh feature you see on a twitter feed, or Facebook like button. Here the state of the UI component changes on the page, without having to manually refresh when the data is updated. This is just one small, yet powerful feature of React.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThrough a complete hands-on project, this course will teach you all the fundamental principles of React that you must know to become a proficient React developer.

In this course you will learn to harness the power of JavaScript, XML, AJAX, and React to build highly interactive web pages from scratch. We start with an introduction into the document object model, followed by an in-depth guide to the essentials of JavaScript. In the JavaScript section you will learn a number of concepts instrumental towards your journey as a developer. This includes working with variables, arithmetic operators, objects, functions, arrays, events, and loops. You will also learn the importance of JavaScript placement, while working with both internal and external JavaScript code components. Students learn the importance of operator precedence when performing simple and complex arithmetic operations. Furthermore, you will have the opportunity to work with conditional statements to perform comparisons between different operations. Once you have a handle on the foundations, we\u2019ll dive into a number of JavaScript development projects where you will have an opportunity to apply your new skills with practical hands-on exercises. This includes building an automated background color changer, and photo gallery complete with mouse overs and image transitions.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn the second section of the course we will explore XML and AJAX to demonstrate the power of asynchronous page updates. This means building web components that automatically update on a web page, without having to manually refresh. You will have an opportunity to work with both XML and AJAX in conjunction with JavaScript to build modern web app components such as a search suggest feature, and a pre-populated select menu.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOnce you have a foundational understanding of JavaScript and AJAX, we will dive into working with React, a powerful JavaScript library used for front-end UI development. The React section starts off with a hands-on project where you\u2019ll learn how to work with functional React components, props, Callback functions, OnClick Events, and the React State hook to build a fully functional calculator. From there we will dive into project number two, where you will build a connect-4 clone. Here we will cover more intermediate concepts including passing props, de-structuring, passing arguments to click events, various styling methods, and handling callbacks. You will also learn about the React key property, React lifecycle events, and conditional rendering. By the end you will have built a complete multi and single player connect-4 game board with built-in AI capabilities. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn the final section of the course we further unleash the power of React by building out a complete e-commerce site with multiple product categories, a product showcase, shopping cart feature, and much more. Here, we introduce a number of integral new concepts including: JSON server, Fetch API, and installing React router. These essential building blocks will be used to render the product categories, style the product list, and configure the product details page. From there we dive into styled components, refactoring the shop layout, and exploring the concept of \u201Ccontext\u201D in React. In the final stages of the project students will configure the shopping cart basket, and the checkout feature. We will also implement a product search feature, followed by in-depth exercises on validating input forms in React.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAs you can see this course covers a tremendous bit of ground. Best of all it\u2019s co-authored by Tim Maclachlan - a renowned senior full-stack developer with over 20 years of commercial development experience. As a multi-faceted developer, Tim specializes in algorithmic, analytical and mobile development.

It assumes that you\u0027re new to the language, so it gets you started with basic functionality such as creating functions, creating variables, and calling these lines of code from your standard HTML pages. It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control and the document object model (DOM).

The focus of the course will be on four key services, including: Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), AWS Storage Solutions, and Elastic Load Balancers (ELB) integrated with Auto Scaling Groups (ASG). \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAmazon EC2 is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It allows users to launch virtual machines (VMs) on demand and pay only for the compute resources they use. In this course, we will explore the different types of instances available, as well as how to launch, configure, and manage EC2 instances.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn addition to the EC2 service, we also explore AWS storage solutions including Elastic Block Store (EBS), Elastic File System (EFS), Snapshots, and Amazon Machine Images (AMIs). EBS is a block-level storage service for use with EC2 instances. It provides persistent storage for data that needs to be frequently accessed. EFS is a file-level storage service for use with EC2 instances. It allows users to create and configure file systems that can be accessed from multiple instances. Snapshots are point-in-time copies of EBS volumes that can be used for backup and recovery. AMIs are pre-configured virtual machine images that can be used to launch EC2 instances. In this course, we will explore the different storage options available and how to use them to manage data on the AWS platform.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOnce students have a handle on the foundations, we explore more intermediate topics relevant to workload distribution through the integration of ELBs and ASGs. Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs) are used to distribute incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances. They automatically scale to handle incoming traffic and can also be used to improve availability and fault tolerance. In this course, we will explore the different types of load balancers available, as well as how to configure and use them to distribute traffic across multiple instances.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWe will demonstrate how to integrate the ELBs with Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs) to ensure workloads are only distributed to healthy nodes within the EC2 service. ASGs allow users to automatically scale the number of EC2 instances in response to changing demand. They automatically launch and terminate instances based on predefined rules, ensuring that the number of instances is always sufficient to handle incoming traffic. In this course, we will explore how to configure and use ASGs to automatically scale the number of instances on the AWS platform.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThroughout the course, we will use hands-on exercises to help students gain practical experience with the AWS platform. Students will have the opportunity to launch and configure EC2 instances, create and manage storage volumes, configure load balancers and auto scaling groups, and work with other AWS services. By the end of the course, students will have a solid understanding of the AWS platform and will be able to use it to build scalable and reliable cloud-based applications.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-elastic-load-balancing-with-auto-scaling-groups/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4925158_0612.jpg","duration":"8 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"6,062.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Students interested in learning the foundations of AWS","Students interested in Cloud Computing","Students interested in exploring the Amazon EC2 Service","Students interested in exploring various EC2 Storage Solutions (EFS, EBS)","Students interested in setting up Highly Available cloud setups using ELBs, and ASGs on AWS"],"tags":["Cloud Computing","Amazon Elastic Block Store","AWS Elastic Load Balancing"],"rating":{"count":28,"averageValue":"4.3"},"instructors":[{"name":"YouAccel Training","url":"/user/youaccel/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.410714}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"YOUACCEL76343","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/internet-and-web-development-fundamentals/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":2334226,"title":"Internet and Web Development Fundamentals","shortDescription":"Learn how the Internet Works and Setup a Testing \u0026 Production Web Server","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EThis course is part-one of the nine-part series that starts by taking an in-depth look at how the internet facilitates the movement of data packets across both LANs (Local Area Network) and WANs (Wide Area Network). Students learn how to interpret various protocols such as TCP/IP, HTTP, HTTPs, SMTP and FTP. We examine the entire flow and life-cycle of data-packet movement from origin to destination. The course examines the role of DNS and SMTP servers in routing internet traffic and email transmissions. Mechanism to safeguard the movement of data, such as network routers, ports and firewalls, are also explored.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStudents are then introduced to the web development process and planning stages of building websites and complex web applications. We conduct an overview of web hosting infrastructures such as shared, VPS, Dedicated and Cloud hosting solutions through case analysis. We then take a look at the role of Domain name registrars and ICANN (The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers). Students learn to register and administer domain names through the GoDaddy domain management console. Management features such as Name Server assignment, auto-renewal, domain privacy, and domain forwarding will be covered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith first-hand insights into the creation of effective web infrastructures and domain management, students learn to configure local testing servers. This includes installing and configuring WAMP/MAMP (Windows/MAC, Apache, MySQL, PhpMyAdmin) on a PC or MAC system. We discuss the role of each essential service as it applies to testing dynamic, database-driven web applications on a local computing system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStudents then explore the configuration of a live production server using popular cloud hosting providers such as Linode. This includes deployment and administration of Ubuntu on Linux based distributions and essential web services (LAMP Stack - Linux, Apache, MySQL, PhpMyAdmin) on scalable virtual machines. Several remote access tools such as PuTTy and Terminal will be used to administer virtual servers through the use of command lines. Servers will be configured with security in mind, using multi-user accounts, SSH authentication, and file permission management.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStudents also learn to install and connect to their virtual machines using remote desktop connection tools such as Tight VNC and Real VNC.

This course offers a comprehensive guide into one of the most powerful, modern JavaScript libraries available - ReactJS. Whether you are completely new to React, or you\u2019ve dabbled with it in the past, one thing\u2019s for sure - You\u2019ve likely interacted with a number of web applications that use the React library for building out user interface components. Some of the most well known examples include Netflix, Facebook, and Airbnb. Developed and maintained by Meta along with a community of independent developers, React remains free and open-source. React is a component based library built entirely on JavaScript, which makes it perfect for designing complex UI\u2019s. With React, developers can build encapsulated components that efficiently manage their own state and render UI updates specifically when data changes. For example, think of the automated content refresh feature you see on a twitter feed, or Facebook like button. Here, the state of the UI component changes on the page without having to manually refresh when the data is updated. This is just one small, yet powerful UI feature built into React.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThis course starts with exploring the foundations of React and its core use cases. We offer a concise definition of what React is and what it\u2019s not. From there, we explore the tools needed to get started along with an introduction into JSX, and Functional React components. Through a complete hands-on project you will learn a number of important concepts including react props, callbacks, OnClick Events and passing parameters within callback functions. By the end of module one you will have built a fully functional calculator, complete with display and numerical operators. We will also cover important topics such as the React State Hook, and Debugging.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn the second module students build out a multiplayer Connect-4 clone, with AI integration. Here we start with styling the individual game board components followed by advanced onClickEvents. This includes global, dynamic and inline styling. From there, we move on to passing props, destructing, and React children. Students will explore the React key property, along with Lifecycle events, game initialization, CSS variables, and conditional rendering. By the end, you will have built a complete Connect-4 game capable of automatically determining the winner in both a multi-player and AI based single player setting.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn module three we further unleash the power of React by building out a complete e-commerce site with multiple product categories, a product showcase, shopping cart feature, and much more. Here, we introduce a number of integral new concepts including: JSON server, Fetch API, and installing React router. These essential building blocks will be used to render the product categories, style the product list, and configure the product details page. From there we dive into styled components, refactoring the shop layout, and exploring the concept of \u201Ccontext\u201D in React. In the final stages of the project students will configure the shopping cart basket, and the integrated checkout feature. We will also implement a product search feature, followed by in-depth exercises on validating input forms in React.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAs you can see this course covers a tremendous bit of ground. Best of all it\u2019s authored by Tim Maclachlan - a renowned senior full-stack developer with over 20 years of commercial development experience. As a multi-faceted developer, Tim\u2019s core competencies include algorithmic, analytical and mobile development.

Cyberthreats refer to vulnerabilities in IT and software systems, like malware attacks, piracy, unauthorized ERP access and unintentional or maliciously injected backdoors in the purchased, open source or proprietary software used by organizations. Supply chain security here primarily involves minimizing risks from using software developed by another organization, and securing organizational data accessed by another organization in your supply chain. Organizations cannot take for granted that the software that they use or purchase is secure. Because close collaboration is often required between businesses, suppliers and resellers, computer networks may become intertwined or sensitive data shared. This can result in a breach of one organization affecting many. Instead of attacking the target directly, a cybercriminal may attack a weaker organization in the target\u0027s supply chain and use that access to meet their goals. Many are responding to recent supply chain attacks such as the SolarWinds attacks by, for example, reducing reliance on foreign suppliers and building primarily domestic supply chains.

Supply chain security here primarily involves minimizing risks from using software developed by another organization, and securing organizational data accessed by another organization in your supply chain. Organizations cannot take for granted that the software that they use or purchase is secure.  Because close collaboration is often required between businesses, suppliers and resellers, computer networks may become intertwined or sensitive data shared. This can result in a breach of one organization affecting many. Instead of attacking the target directly, a cybercriminal may attack a weaker organization in the target\u0027s supply chain and use that access to meet their goals.  Many are responding to recent supply chain attacks such as the SolarWinds attacks by, for example, reducing reliance on foreign suppliers and building primarily domestic supply chains. Some companies are moving production out of foreign factories to domestic ones as well. This course can give a basic protection to devices used to access servers which have been attacked and protect the device."],"tags":["Cyber Security"],"rating":{"count":8,"averageValue":"2.9"},"instructors":[{"name":"Joseph Darkoh","url":"/user/josephdarkoh/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":2.9375}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":true,"couponData":null},"https://www.udemy.com/course/how-to-sell-your-book-before-you-write-it/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5321226,"title":"How to Sell Your Book Before You Write It","shortDescription":"How to earn royalties from your book idea TODAY \u2014 no need to wait until it\u0027s published (or even written)","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EHave a great book idea but don\u0027t have the up-front funds to invest in its creation? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re not alone.

A single table holds records, and each record is stored in a row on the table. Tables are the most used type of database objects or structures that hold or reference data in a relational database.
