It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhich all classification techniques are taught in this course?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this course we learn both parametric and non-parametric classification techniques.

It totally depends on you. The method we adopted to help you learn classification starts from the basics and takes you to advanced level within hours. You can follow the same, but remember you can learn nothing without practicing it. Practice is the only way to remember whatever you have learnt. Therefore, we have also provided you with another data set to work on as a separate project of classification.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat are the steps I should follow to be able to build a Machine Learning model?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can divide your learning process into 3 parts:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStatistics and Probability - Implementing Machine learning techniques require basic knowledge of Statistics and probability concepts. Second section of the course covers this part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnderstanding of Machine learning - Fourth section helps you understand the terms and concepts associated with Machine learning and gives you the steps to be followed to build a machine learning model\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProgramming Experience - A significant part of machine learning is programming. Python and R clearly stand out to be the leaders in the recent days. Third section will help you set up the Python environment and teach you some basic operations. In later sections there is a video on how to implement each concept taught in theory lecture in Python\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnderstanding of\u0026nbsp; models - Fifth and sixth section cover Classification models and with each theory lecture comes a corresponding practical lecture where we actually run each query with you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy use R for Machine Learning?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnderstanding R is one of the valuable skills needed for a career in Machine Learning. Below are some reasons why you should learn Machine learning in R\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\t1. It\u2019s a popular language for Machine Learning at top tech firms. Almost all of them hire data scientists who use R. Facebook, for example, uses R to do behavioral analysis with user post data. Google uses R to assess ad effectiveness and make economic forecasts. And by the way, it\u2019s not just tech firms: R is in use at analysis and consulting firms, banks and other financial institutions, academic institutions and research labs, and pretty much everywhere else data needs analyzing and visualizing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\t2. Learning the data science basics is arguably easier in R. R has a big advantage: it was designed specifically with data manipulation and analysis in mind. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\t3. Amazing packages that make your life easier. Because R was designed with statistical analysis in mind, it has a fantastic ecosystem of packages and other resources that are great for data science. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\t4. Robust, growing community of data scientists and statisticians. As the field of data science has exploded, R has exploded with it, becoming one of the fastest-growing languages in the world (as measured by StackOverflow). That means it\u2019s easy to find answers to questions and community guidance as you work your way through projects in R.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\t5. Put another tool in your toolkit. No one language is going to be the right tool for every job. Adding R to your repertoire will make some projects easier \u2013 and of course, it\u2019ll also make you a more flexible and marketable employee when you\u2019re looking for jobs in data science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat is the difference between Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPut simply, machine learning and data mining use the same algorithms and techniques as data mining, except the kinds of predictions vary. While data mining discovers previously unknown patterns and knowledge, machine learning reproduces known patterns and knowledge\u2014and further automatically applies that information to data, decision-making, and actions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDeep learning, on the other hand, uses advanced computing power and special types of neural networks and applies them to large amounts of data to learn, understand, and identify complicated patterns.

There are any number of reasons why people decide that they or their business must change. Decisions are about change. In fact, the Wall Street Journal tells us that we make 35,000 decisions a day. Admittedly, a lot of them are insignificant such as what flavor ice cream would you choose. But some decisions or changes could affect the future of our businesses, our income, even our lives. Major decisions should be made by tapping into a wide variety of resources and perhaps people. This entails being open to opinions, data, analysis that my differ from our beliefs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESometimes we think we are embracing change but for how long?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake the example of self-help books.

It may come with higher pay but it may entail more hours at the office. Increased responsibilities like having to hire and fire people.

With this course you have the opportunity to relive this fond childhood memory by building a connect-4 clone using React. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EReact, also known as React JS, is a powerful JavaScript library used for building custom, interactive user interfaces using UI components. Some of the most well known examples of organizations using React for their front-end include Netflix, Facebook, and Airbnb. Developed and maintained by Meta along with a community of independent developers, React remains free and open-source. React is a component based library built entirely on JavaScript, which makes it perfect for designing complex UI\u2019s. With React, developers can build encapsulated components that efficiently manage their own state and render UI updates specifically when data changes. For example, think of the automated content refresh feature you see on a twitter feed, or Facebook like button. Here the state of the UI component changes on the page, without having to manually refresh when the data is updated. This is just one small, yet powerful feature of React.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThrough a complete hands-on project, this course will teach you all the fundamental principles of React that you must know to become a proficient React developer. We start with the tools needed to get started with React, along with instructions on creating the Connect-4 game board. From there we dive in to React OnClick Events, Passing Props, Destructing, React Children, and Passing Arguments. With a solid understanding of the foundations, students move on to various styling techniques for the game components, along with Dynamic classes, and handling callbacks. Here we\u2019ll explore inline, global, and dynamic styling coupled with dynamic classes. We will then move on to the React State Hook, React Key Property and initializing the game modules. Students then tackle more intermediate concepts including the logical components of calculating a winner, determining a draw, and React Lifecycle events. In the last module, we explore the implementation of AI for automated move suggestions, and single player games.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn addition to the hands-on React module, we also offer a comprehensive overview of JavaScript for those who need a refresher. Here we start with introducing students to the document object model (DOM) which defines the logical structure of HTML documents. From there we dive into JavaScript to demonstrate various methods in which DOM elements can be manipulated to add interactivity to static components. We start right from the basics, which includes JavaScript placement, and data output. From there we move on to variable declaration, arithmetic operations, operator precedence, data types, and objects. Once the foundations are covered, we move on to more complex operations using Arrays, Conditional Statements, JavaScript comparison operators, Booleans and loops. Here students will learn to unleash the true power of JavaScript to render different outcomes based on user interaction. We will explore the use of functions to efficiently handle repetitive tasks and JavaScript events to handle output based on actions and occurrences. The section will conclude with a hands-on project where students will implement their knowledge to build a web based photo gallery and background color changer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/build-a-connect-4-clone-in-react-javascript-foundations/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4789918_7294.jpg","duration":"5.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"36,655.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Students interested in learning how to build interactive web pages using JavaScript","Students interested in learning ReactJS","Students interested in front-end UI Development using React","Students interested in learning JavaScript Foundations"],"tags":["JavaScript","React JS"],"rating":{"count":125,"averageValue":"4.4"},"instructors":[{"name":"YouAccel Training","url":"/user/youaccel/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.3846154}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"YOUACCEL79773","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"1 day","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/adobe-lightroom-classic-cc-the-map-book-module/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4900680,"title":"Adobe Lightroom Classic CC: The Map \u0026 Book Module","shortDescription":"Geotag Images | Filter and Save Locations | Book Settings | Book Layout | Text Formatting | Backgrounds | Exporting","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003ELightroom is an intuitive photo editing application used by both enthusiasts and professional photographers.

These \u0022units\u0022 can be customers, orders, products, or any other relevant metric. Analyzing unit economics helps companies and experts assess the sustainability and profitability of their operations.  Here\u0027s why learning about unit economics is crucial for both experts and companies:","Sustainability and Profitability Assessment: Unit economics provide a clear view of whether a business is sustainable and profitable. By examining the revenue generated and the costs incurred on a per-unit basis, experts and companies can evaluate if they are making money or losing it with each sale or customer acquisition.  Scaling Decisions: Understanding unit economics is vital for making informed decisions about scaling a business. If the cost to acquire a customer is higher than the revenue generated from that customer over time, it may not be sustainable to scale the business without making changes.","Business Model Optimization: Unit economics analysis allows experts and companies to identify areas for optimization. It helps in finding cost-effective ways to acquire and retain customers, reduce operational costs, and increase average revenue per unit.  Investor Confidence: For startups and growing companies, demonstrating positive unit economics is often essential to attract investors. It shows that the business model is sound and has the potential for long-term profitability.","Risk Management: By understanding unit economics, companies can identify potential risks early. If the per-unit cost is too high, it may lead to financial instability or bankruptcy in the long run.  Pricing Strategies: Unit economics are key in setting appropriate pricing for products or services. Companies can determine the right balance between pricing and costs to maximize profitability.  Strategic Decision-Making: Business decisions related to product development, marketing campaigns, and resource allocation should be guided by a deep understanding of unit economics. It helps in focusing resources on high-impact areas.","Developing skills related to unit economics can be highly beneficial for building a career in various fields, including business, finance, and entrepreneurship:  Entrepreneurship: Entrepreneurs who understand unit economics can create and refine business models that are more likely to succeed. This knowledge is crucial for securing funding and effectively managing their startups.  Finance and Investment: Professionals in finance and investment need to evaluate the financial health of companies. An understanding of unit economics helps them assess the viability of potential investments.","Marketing and Sales: Marketers can make informed decisions about customer acquisition channels and campaigns based on the cost to acquire a customer and the customer\u0027s lifetime value. Sales teams can prioritize high-value leads.  Operations and Supply Chain Management: Professionals in operations and supply chain management can optimize processes, reduce costs, and improve efficiency by analyzing the unit economics of production and distribution.  Consulting and Advisory Roles: Consultants and advisors who can help companies optimize their unit economics are highly sought after. They can provide valuable insights and recommendations.","Unit economics is a critical aspect of business strategy and financial analysis.

But you will only learn to play it well till you keep on practicing. Course is comprehensive \u0026amp; short, but the key to learn is practicing, practiding \u0026amp; practicing. No other way. No overnight learning. No short cuts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave you ever dreamed of playing the vocals of your favorite song on electric keyboared? If\u0026nbsp; yes, this course is for you. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this course, with the help of any app like organ 2024, which is free to use or any other, your mobile phone will be converted into a real touch electric keyboared. And you will see white and black notes as you see in a piano. I have deigned this course in such a way that most of the lectures in this course are interactive video lectures where I have recorded my mobile screen. So you will see on your mobile, laptop, desktop etc the full screen of my mobile phone and you will listen my voice while learning, \u0026amp; you\u0026nbsp; will also listen the voice of the keyboard when I will touch any key on my touch mobile. You will also see the touched key pressed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can learn by 2 methods, one that if you have a desktop or laptop, you start my course there and you should playing what I am teaching you on your mobile.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other method is that you open my course on your mobile browser on desktop version and start it. Before that, it\u0027s better to open the organ app of keyboared which you will download from android play store or apple store. So after listening my course \u0026amp; understanding, mimize the browser after pausing the video tutorial and open the app and start practicing what you have seen. After that, you will again go to browser to start the course from where you left. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst method has the advantage that while you watch, you can play on your mobile phone. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second method has the advantage that you can learn on the go where ever you are. So it\u0027s your choice. You may use the combinition of both. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe will learn how to move fingers on white \u0026amp; black notes from scratch. Even, a person who has never touch keyboard can learn with course. We will be learning the names of these notes in English. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegarding the course after learning the basic notes \u0026amp; Music terminologies we will practice these notes with a couple of songs. Hopefully, by then, you will yourself be in the position to create the melody of any song you want or ever wished to play in thev voice like Flute, violin, guitar etc, and imagine, if you can play what the singer is singing (vocals) on your keyboard called (Lead) in any of your favorite instrument\u0027s voice, it will really be a\u0026nbsp; dream come true if you are a\u0026nbsp; passionate lover and learner of music. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIsn\u0027t it exciting thing\u0026nbsp; that you not need to buy even a keyboard. But you have various apps and your mobile phone has been virtually converted to a musical keyboard. You may even attach your mobile to speaker to play in a family or friends gathering after you have got the confidence. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven more exciting is that as the sound is produced from mobile, there are no issues of recording. And if you buy a real keyboard or harmonium/Harmonica, you will play it in the same way as you will learn in this course. If you like this course, you may ask for Flute \u0026amp; violin lessons if you may want.

When you breathe in, feel the belly become bigger and then your lungs to expand. Inflate your lungs like balloons- forward, backward, and into your side body as well. Deepening the breath and maintaining a deep breathing pattern while doing the movements takes time and attention. Be patient with yourself and keep returning your attention to your breath, eventually linking breath with movement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe practices become very meditative and increase in their potency with repetition.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOver time, as you repeat the practices and become more comfortable with the movements, you can close your eyes and bring your attention more and more to the energy flowing.

In this course you will learn how to use JavaScript along with two powerful JavaScript libraries to build dynamic, interactive web pages. We start with introducing students to the document object model (DOM) which defines the logical structure of HTML documents. From there we dive into JavaScript to demonstrate various methods in which DOM elements can be manipulated to add interactivity to static components. The JavaScript section starts right from the basics, which includes JavaScript placement, and data output. From there we move on to variable declaration, arithmetic operations, operator precedence, data types, and objects. Once the foundations are covered, we move on to more complex operations using Arrays, Conditional Statements, JavaScript comparison operators, booleans and loops. Here students will learn to unleash the true power of JavaScript to render different outcomes based on user interaction. We will explore the use of functions to efficiently handle repetitive tasks and JavaScript events to handle output based on actions and occurrences. The section will conclude with a hands-on project where students will implement their knowledge to build a web based photo gallery and background color changer.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn the second section of this course, students will learn to work with jQuery - a powerful JavaScript library designed to simplify HTML DOM tree traversal and manipulation. jQuery is ultra lightweight, feature rich, and cross-platform compatible. It\u2019s one of the easiest libraries to work with for building out JavaScript features on an HTML web page. jQuery is excellent for event handling, CSS animations, and Ajax integration for asynchronous UI state changes. Similar to the JavaScript section, the jQuery module begins with the foundations. This includes instructions on embedding jQuery to a web page, and an intro into jQuery syntax. Students will learn to work with jQuery selectors, events, and toggling. From there we dive into animations using fades, slides, and the jQuery animate function. Students also learn about chaining, draggable objects, callback functions, the get content method, toggling classes, and filtering. By the end of the jQuery module, you will know how to build stunning animated web pages with ease.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn the last section of this course we\u2019ll explore React - a cutting edge JavaScript library for building state-of-the art user interface components. You\u2019ve likely seen React in action on some of the hottest web apps developed by fortune 500 companies. For example, Netflix, Facebook, and AirBnB all use React for their front-end UI. As a matter of fact, React was developed by Meta alongside a community of independent developers. Until this day, React remains free and open-source so it has plenty of support and documentation. Unlike jQuery which interacts with the document object model directly, React works through a \u201Cvirtual\u201D DOM. React is unaware of changes made to the DOM outside of React and determines updates based on its own internal representations. React is best for creating reusable code blocks for UI components and layering them on top of each other to minimize the number of times the DOM needs to be re-rendering on state changes. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe React section of this course starts off with a hands-on project where you\u2019ll learn how to work with functional React components, props, Callback functions, OnClick Events, and the React State hook to build a fully functional calculator. From there we will dive into project number two, where you will build a connect-4 clone. Here we will cover more intermediate concepts including passing props, destructuring, passing arguments to click events, various styling methods, and handling callbacks. You will also learn about the React key property, React lifecycle events, and conditional rendering. By the end you will have built a complete multi and single player connect-4 game board with built-in AI capabilities. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn the final section of the course we further unleash the power of React by building out a complete e-commerce site with multiple product categories, a product showcase, shopping cart feature, and much more. Here, we introduce a number of integral new concepts including: JSON server, Fetch API, and installing React router. These essential building blocks will be used to render the product categories, style the product list, and configure the product details page. From there we dive into styled components, refactoring the shop layout, and exploring the concept of \u201Ccontext\u201D in React. In the final stages of the project students will configure the shopping cart basket, and the checkout feature. We will also implement a product search feature, followed by in-depth exercises on validating input forms in React.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAs you can see this course covers a tremendous bit of ground. Best of all it\u2019s co-authored by Tim Maclachlan - a renowned senior full-stack developer with over 20 years of commercial development experience. As a multi-faceted developer, Tim specializes in algorithmic, analytical and mobile development. To date, he\u2019s written hundreds of applications and worked in a number of industries from commercial aviation and military, to banking and finance. Tim has a genuine passion for teaching others how to become better coders and looks forward to interacting with his students.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWith that said, we hope you\u2019re just as excited about this course as we are, if so - hit that enroll button and let\u2019s get started.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-javascript-jquery-and-react-bootcamp-hands-on/","imageUri":"https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4789948_a375.jpg","duration":"13 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"43,812.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Students interested in working with Popular JavaScript Libraries","Students interested in Building Interactive UI Components using React and jQuery","Students interested in Mastering Front-End Development using JavaScript"],"tags":["JavaScript","jQuery","React JS"],"rating":{"count":272,"averageValue":"4.5"},"instructors":[{"name":"YouAccel Training","url":"/user/youaccel/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.443182}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"YOUACCEL79773","originalPrice":"\u20B91,999","discountedPrice":"\u20B9449","expirationText":"5 hours","discountPercentage":78}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/flutter-bootcamp-build-crypto-tracker-application/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5585844,"title":"Flutter Bootcamp: Build Crypto Tracker Application","shortDescription":"Flutter Bootcamp to build Crypto Tracker Application: REST APIs, Local Storage, Responsive UI, State Management etc.","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EAre you ready to dive into the exciting world of cryptocurrency tracking app development?
