I wanted to learn, not only what a media trainer does, but also what steps I would have to take in order to become a successful media trainer--TJ discusses all this in a clear and concise manner, in a tone that is welcoming and never alienating. The only constructive critique I would give would be concerning the technical form of the presentation, more specifically the video quality and picture aesthetic. Going by the current standard as it applies to video, everything we view is in high definition. Having said that, I believe the video quality could be improved upon as well as the backdrop which I found to be a bit generic and outdated. I found these minor flaws to be slightly distracting and given the high caliber of the speaker and the information being presented I believe these aspects detracted, if only marginally, from the quality of the product.\u0022\u0026nbsp;\u003C/em\u003ENick Cisik\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u00225 Stars!

This is a comprehensive project based course where you will learn step by step on how to create and animate interactive presentation slides using AI. In addition, you will also learn how to make hyper realistic AI avatars that look like humans and they will read the presentation slides for you. Even more exciting, once the presentation is ready, you will do the presentations in virtual reality where you can invite people to join your metaverse. In the introduction session, you will learn how AI can help you to create presentation slides, for examples like generating designs, generating presentation contents, and animating the slides. Then, in the next session, you will continue by learning the ideal presentation structure, such as introduction, content overview, main body, conclusion and you will also get to know what components that should be included in each section. Afterward, you will enter the first project section where you will be guided step by step on how to generate compelling presentation slides using ten AI tools like Boardmix, Slides Pilot, GPT PPT, Plus Docs, Gamma, Tome, Slideoo AI, Power Mode AI, Magic Slides, and Send Steps. In this section, you will use those AI tools to generate presentation slides for a variety of purposes like creating market research reports, investor pitch, educational materials, consulting reports, and minimum viable products. Then, in the second project section, you will learn how to animate your presentation slides using an AI tool called Visme, you will specifically learn how to make a smooth transition from one slide to another slide. In the third section, you will learn how to utilize AI avatars to read your presentation slides and do the presentation on your behalf. In this section, you are going to use AI tools called Hour One AI and Colossyan. Meanwhile, in the last project section, you will learn how to do presentations in virtual reality using Framevr IO. This tool will enable you to do presentations in stunning metaverse and you can also do presentations in many different places, for example, like virtual offices, virtual classrooms, and outdoor theaters. Lastly, at the end of the course, you will also learn how to sell customizable presentation templates on Etsy and offer freelancing services to create custom presentations for your clients\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirstly, before getting into the course, we need to ask this question to ourselves: why should we utilize AI to create presentation slides? Well there are many reasons and let me answer that question. First of all, you will be able to automate and speed up the process of creating, designing, and animating presentation slides. Can you imagine how long will it take you to write contents for each slide, how long will it take you to design each slide? How long will it take you to add animation to each slide? Well, if you do everything manually, it is going to be very time consuming. However, by outsourcing some of your work to AI, not only will you save a lot of time but you will also be more efficient. Other than that, almost everyone needs to do a presentation, whether you are a student, teacher, professional workers, or even business owners. Therefore, you can also sell customizable presentation templates to those people.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow are things that you can expect to learn from this course:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how AI can be used to create presentation slides\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn about the ideal presentation structure\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to generate presentation slides using Boardmix\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to generate presentation slides using Slides Pilot\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to generate presentation slides using GPT PPT\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to generate market research presentation using Plus\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to generate presentation slides using Gamma\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to generate consulting report using Tome\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to generate presentation slides using Slideoo AI\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to generate investor pitch using PowerMode AI\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to generate presentation slides using Magic Slides\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to generate presentation slides using Send Steps\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to animate presentation slides using Visme\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to create AI avatars using Hour One AI and Colossyan.

I know in additional to being afraid of the dark and height, speaking in front of others is a fear my child has exhibited. I like the way the Instructors talked directly to the child on the videos and used examples children could relate. I like the flow of the class. I learned there is a \u201Cmagic phrase.\u201D I also learned to have my child to use the video that is on the PC, SmartPhone and Tablet as tool to help them with this skill. I could relate to several examples of what not to do. The Instructor teaches from the view of an experienced Media Personality.
