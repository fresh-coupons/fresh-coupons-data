Firstly, my course provides an understanding of what shitcoins are and how to identify the most promising new projects that have just launched on multiple chains. This knowledge is crucial for traders looking to make significant returns in the volatile cryptocurrency market.  Furthermore, this course teaches traders when to buy and sell shitcoins, which is an essential aspect of any trading strategy. This course also offers insights on how to find the safest shitcoins that will not result in any rug pulls, ensuring traders can protect their investments.  This course also provides valuable information on how to quickly check the market cap, liquidity, supply, contract safety, honeypot, and rug pull risks of a shitcoin in less than a minute. This is an important skill for traders to have, as it can help them identify profitable opportunities while avoiding potential losses.  Your course provides early access to low-cap gems and offers copy trading of shitcoins with more than 999% APY. This can help traders achieve significant returns with minimal effort and risk.  Additionally, this course offers insights into finding the safest shitcoins presales to convert 0.1 BNB into 1 BNB, and how to make daily 2x-15x returns with just swapping shitcoins. This is a valuable skill for traders looking to make consistent profits from trading.  My course also teaches traders how to find already listed shitcoins ready for a pump, which can help them capitalize on market trends and maximize their returns. Moreover, I provide valuable information on how to create your own BSC crypto token for trading with less than $2, and how to provide liquidity and verify the CA on Bsc scan.  Finally, this course shows traders how to convert their own token market cap into more than 100k, which can be a significant achievement for any trader. Overall, this course offers a comprehensive set of skills and knowledge that can help people profit from trading shitcoins."],"tags":["Finance \u0026 Accounting","Cryptocurrency \u0026
