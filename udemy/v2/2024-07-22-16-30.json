Just go over the videos that we have on our YouTube channel, and you will be fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother feature of this course is the prototyping approach. Even though we\u2019ve made and published the game before we started working on this course, we decided to show you a somewhat more natural process of game development where we start simple, with primitive graphics and simple functionality and expand our project throughout the course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, instead of spending a lot of time perfecting the game controls or the UI, we first create a more primitive version and then polish them in smaller increments. And as we do that, we show you how to fix common bugs and address larger issues that arise when you expand your project.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe believe this approach is more beneficial for learning as the experiences you get in the process will enable you to address similar issues in other projects that you might be interested to be involved in in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Billiard Table Vectors by Vecteezy\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/eightball-pool-with-unity/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4404990_cbd8_7.jpg","duration":"24 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"224.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["This course is for people who wish to learn how to make publishable 3D physics-based mobile games using the Unity game engine."],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":0,"averageValue":"0.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"MrM Programming","url":"/user/mrm-programming/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":0}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"E4835E0F9671446FBB09","originalPrice":"\u20B91,999","discountedPrice":"\u20B9399","expirationText":"3 days","discountPercentage":80}}},"freeCourses":{}}
