For that purpose I will use the Python programming language and Flask framework.\u0026nbsp; If you are not aware of current technologies, don\u0027t worry, you should not. Believe me, the application would be extremely simple, so anyone, even a child, can understand how it works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile creating according application I will concentrate at next essential aspects:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECustom exceptions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELogging\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will explain why it is so essential to have those both things at any application and how to make it properly in order it would be helpful from a security defense perspective.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe principles which I will show you are extremely simple and can be easily propagated at any existing web application. You will see the real power of properly done exceptions and logging at your own eyes when we will make real hacker\u2019s attacks simulations at our application after deploying it at AWS cloud\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGenerally speaking, deploying - it is 2nd essential part of our learning. Together we will deploy our test API application at AWS using Terraform. And again, if you have never used current technology, don\u2019t worry. I will show you step by step, how to run according terraform scripts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt 1st we will prepare the AWS network, after that we will deploy AWS ALB with WAF, and finally, at the last step, we will deploy our application at EC2 using an auto scaling group. Current pattern of deployment can be easily used by you at production as it is rather cost effective and almost a HA solution. Though as every solution it also has some limitations, which I will discover during Terraform lectures\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt deployment section I will speak a lot about different AWS Services, that would be used for creating security defense mechanisms\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIAM policies and Security groups as restriction mechanisms to our resources\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ES3 as place for keeping our ALB and WAF logs\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECloudWath as centralized log storage and alarm system\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESNS - as mechanism for sending alarm notifications during security attacks detection\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will also touch a little bit Route 53 and Certificate manager services\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe deployed Falsk application and all AWS infrastructure around it would be intensively used as a lab environment for imitating different hacker\u2019s attacks and providing a cyber security learning process.

This course might become your first step to acquire skill set, knowledges and maybe even a whole new profession, that is appearing right now. Learning it today, gives you advantages tomorrow!  I\u2019m talking about digital transformation. In terms of customer communications in basically any meduim or big enterprises. And for small businesses, the most succesfull ones, they are already doing it in a modern way from the first day.  This transformation - it is a moving away from old way of communications, like phone calls, email, or even fax - to new way - whatsapp, facebook messenger, instagram direct messages, telegram - any messaging apps that people are using in their everyday life. And now they are starting to us\u0443 it to talk to businesses. To chat with an online store, with a bank, medical clinic - with any organization out there.","All of these companies need employees or contractors who understand how to make this shift, this transition. New channels on the one hand bring a lot of new possibilities, such as chatbots and artificial intelligence, and on the other hand, require a rebuilding of current business workflows.  For example agent\u2019s KPI in a contact centre based on whatsapp, is very different from a voice-based CC. And somebody need to know how to deal with it.  But the contact center is not the only place where apps like whatsapp are taking over. It affects pretty much every customer related departpent: sales, marketing and loyalty, support, customer experience, automation and online services.  So, Whether you plan to tie your career or business entirely to this feild, this knowledge will help you achieve your professional goals in a variety of ways. Because communication - is the essential part of business.  I started this journey seven years ago, when it was hardly even existed. Since then, I have worked with some of the world\u0027s biggest clients, such as Societe Generale, British american tobacco and others. Now I\u2019m a founder of a startup called brandy. im  I invite you to my course where you will learn the basics about communications of the future. Welcome!","Before we start I want to give a quick intro of myself and also let\u2019s take a look on the course plan.  So without further ado, here is what we will discuss  The course consists of 2 parts:  In a first one, everything down lesson 4, we are talking about the key benefits for business in general.  And then learning the basics of chatbots and AI.  The second part is becoming more specific.  We will see how exactly it implies to different departments. Discuss business application of particular messaging channels.  And with all of that we are getting ready to meet the main framework \u2013  of ideal customer journey in modern channels. Which will be useful tool to any of your further projects.  And briefly about me.  You can call me Slava. For a last 7 years I\u2019ve been running chat platform startup. For these years we made a lot of stuff, worked with some worldwide clients.  We have become official provider of apple messages for business. Not sure if this is my most significant achievement, but personally, the most pleasant one.
