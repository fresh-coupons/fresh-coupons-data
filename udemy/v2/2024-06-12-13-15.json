I love that the courses aren\u0027t just pulling numbers from thin air, it actually shows data to back their tactics up. Also, lots of the courses out there talk about high-level marketing strategy, while startup SaaS marketers often have to also know how to execute the strategy as they may be solo marketers in the company. For example, a very hands-on approach to doing ABM on LinkedIn \u002B the software/tools marketers can use are very helpful in the module about ABM marketing. Last but not the least, Dekker introduced many good books (some academic, some easier to read) on the subject matter. I gave 4.5 stars because I figured that the content of each module can be reorganized to be more on-topic (some are a bit repetitive, but I understand that repetition is important in marketing :) ). It would also be great if more SaaS-specific examples can be provided, especially on the topic of PMM\u0027s role in leading product launches, feature updates, etc.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECovenant Chimnonso\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u0022This course has provided me with a different, more advanced view of Product Marketing leadership and a more general view to approaching marketing generally.

I wanted to learn, not only what a media trainer does, but also what steps I would have to take in order to become a successful media trainer--TJ discusses all this in a clear and concise manner, in a tone that is welcoming and never alienating. The only constructive critique I would give would be concerning the technical form of the presentation, more specifically the video quality and picture aesthetic. Going by the current standard as it applies to video, everything we view is in high definition. Having said that, I believe the video quality could be improved upon as well as the backdrop which I found to be a bit generic and outdated. I found these minor flaws to be slightly distracting and given the high caliber of the speaker and the information being presented I believe these aspects detracted, if only marginally, from the quality of the product.\u0022\u0026nbsp;\u003C/em\u003ENick Cisik\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u00225 Stars!

Here I will tell you about interesting OpenSearch pitfalls that I discovered during my commercial practice. And believe me - you will not find that information at AWS documentation. You will get a ready terraform module for deploying the Opensearch cluster and we will analyze it step by step together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EIn the 2d part\u003C/em\u003E I will show how to deploy an ES cluster at ECS (Elastic Container Service). And again we will use the terraform modules for that. I will show you why you can\u0027t use Fargate in that case and how many problems should be resolved to deploy ES at ECS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ENext course\u003C/em\u003E section is about how to deploy ES at EC2 instances using docker swarm. I will prove to you that it is the easiest and at the same time the most cheap way to deploy ES at almost any cloud for most small and middle companies with a steady growth pattern. You will get ready terraform modules that will allow you to prepare AWS infrastructure and ansible modules for deploying HA ES cluster upon it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThe 4th part\u003C/em\u003E is devoted to autoscaling possibilities of ES cluster using different deployment approaches.
