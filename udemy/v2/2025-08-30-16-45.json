It emphasizes communication, collaboration, and shared responsibility to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.  Key Concepts:  Automation: Automating tasks like building, testing, and deployment.  Continuous Integration (CI): Frequently integrating code changes into a central repository.  Continuous Delivery (CD): Automating the release pipeline to ensure code can be rapidly and reliably deployed to production.  Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Managing infrastructure in a declarative manner, often using code, to automate provisioning and management.  Monitoring and Feedback: Continuous monitoring of applications and infrastructure to identify and address issues quickly.","Version Control  What it is: Version control systems (like Git) record changes to files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.  Benefits:  Collaboration: Multiple developers can work on the same codebase without conflicts.  History Tracking: See the complete history of changes, who made them, and when.  Rollback: Revert to previous versions if needed.
