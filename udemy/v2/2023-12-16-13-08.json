Remark, who found the fungal nature of favus in 1837 Berg who reported oral candidiasis in 1841 Wilkinson, who described vaginal candidiasis in 1849. Tinea versicolor was described clinically in 1846 by Eichstaedt, and its etiologic agent was identified in 1853. Beigel reported white Piedra in 1856 Piedra, which means \u0022stone\u0022 in Spanish, is an asymptomatic superficial fungal infection of the hair shaft. In 1865, Beigel first described Piedra in The Human Hair: Its Structure, Growth, Diseases, and Their Treatment; although, he may have been describing Aspergillus infection. Cerqueira, tinea nigra in 1891 In 1910 Raymond Sabouraud published his book Les Teignes, which was a comprehensive study of dermatophytic fungi. He is also regarded as father of medical mycology. In 1927, Nan Nizzi reported the description of the sexual state of Microspore gypsum. In 1927, Nannizzi reported the description of the sexual state of Microsporum gypseum the taxonomy of yeast fungi was described by Lodder and Kregervan Rij in 1952.

This Microcontroller is called\u0026nbsp;DigiSpark.\u0026nbsp;It is a microcontroller\u0026nbsp;based on the Attiny85 development board. It is similar to Arduino but smaller and more powerful in terms of\u0026nbsp;hacking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstalling backdoors, exfiltrating documents, or capturing credentials is incredibly easy with a seemingly innocent USB drive called the USB\u0026nbsp; Rubber Ducky. An Expert hacker with a few minutes, photographic memory,\u0026nbsp; and perfect typing accuracy can use a few well-crafted keystrokes to hack virtually anything they have physical access to. However, the proper hardware can do the same thing every time on demand without fail.\u0026nbsp; That\u2019s where the Rubber Ducky and other Human Interface Devices (HID)\u0026nbsp; come into play. They inject keystrokes at superhuman speeds, violating computers\u0027 inherent trust in humans by posing as a keyboard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this class, we\u2019ll learn more about what HID attacks are, how they work,\u0026nbsp; the social engineering that can be involved in their deployment, and how to use them in your Pen-testing engagements. Keyboards announce themselves to computers as HID devices and are in turn automatically recognized and accepted. We\u0027ll program a microcontroller in Arduino to take advantage of this by acting as an HID device. We can then create scripts that run when the device is plugged into a target computer. All at only a fraction of the cost of the more well-branded USB Rubber\u0026nbsp; Ducky!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStudents will learn to use a low-cost Digispark to program their payloads for use in Ethical Hacking and Penetration testing. We\u0027ll go over creating more advanced loads, including tracking payloads that run in the background, as well as Rickroll payloads that can be used with permission from friends and family to demonstrate how HID attacks work. Additionally, students learn to automate nearly anything on an unattended device which can be extremely useful when you need to run the same commands on a series of computers.\u0026nbsp; That\u2019s how the Original USB Ruber Ducky was invented. Hak5 founder\u0026nbsp; Darren Kitchen, while working as a sysadmin, got tired of typing the same commands to fix printers and network shares, again and again, and the device evolved out of laziness. He programmed a development board to emulate the typing for him - and thus the keystroke injection attack was born.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0647\u0644 \u0635\u0646\u0627\u0639\u0647 \u062C\u0647\u0627\u0632 \u0631\u0627\u0628\u0631 \u062F\u0643\u064A\u061F\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u062F\u0639\u0646\u0627 \u0646\u062A\u0639\u0631\u0641 \u0639\u0644\u0649\u0026nbsp;

In the first section, we will introduce linear programming, and we will explore the convexity and types of optimalities. Then, in the second section, we will build up on the basics to learn ways to solve the linear program using the simplex method. We will then explore the concept of linear programming duality. We will also go through some of the hardest-to-understand concepts like strong duality, complementary slackness, and Farkas\u0027 lemma. Furthermore, we try to understand these concepts in an easy-to-follow way. This allows one to obtain lower bounds on the minimization problem and provide proof of optimality or Infeasibility. In the last section, we will explore how to perform sensitivity analysis (the effects of changing parts of a linear program). At the end of each section, there are assignments to help you evaluate your knowledge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you would have noticed, this course doesn\u0027t explore modeling optimization problems as a linear program much.

Sell premium membership to your Discord Server","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to Building \u0026amp; Monetizing Paid Community via Monthly Subscription course. This is a comprehensive project based course where you will learn step by step on how to build, grow, monetise an online community and potentially turn it into sustainable passive income. This course will be focusing on three main objectives, the first one is to guide you step by step on how to set up your paid community, the second objective is to utilise AI to generate many different forms of contents for your paid community, and the third objective is to grow your paid community by implementing effective marketing strategies. In the introduction session, you will learn the basic fundamentals of the subscription based model, for example, getting to know benefits of this business model and learn about key performance indicators like monthly recurring revenue, cancellation rate, and retention rate. Then, you will continue by learning several strategies to identify your niche and learn how to target the right audience. In this session, we are going to have a case study about successful Discord channels with a substantial amount of members. Afterward, you will learn how to create content for your paid community, for instance like creating mini online courses, info products, case study analysis, E-book, and coaching sessions. This part is very essential because when you are building a community, you are not only responsible for providing your members a place to interact with each other but also to provide valuable content. Then, in the next session, you will be guided step by step on how to build your paid community using Whop, Launch Pass, Mighty Networks, and Patreon. Those are platforms where you can host your paid community and they also provide you with payment integration which enables you to charge new subscribers for accessing your paid community. Afterward, you will learn how to speed up the growth of your paid community by partnering with social media influencers who already have a lot of followers. Then, in the next session, you will learn several pricing strategies like freemium model, tiered pricing, and discounted annual billing. Lastly at the end of the course, you will learn how to promote your paid community by implementing several strategies like social media promotion, building a referral program, inviting people to webinars, and sharing member testimonials.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirstly, before getting into the course, we need to ask this question to ourselves, why should we build and grow a paid community? Well, there are many reasons why, first of all, selling subscriptions to your paid community requires very minimum starting capital and as matter of fact you can even start this business with no upfront cost. Secondly, a monthly subscription based business model offers you with stable and predictable revenue since your members will be required to pay every month to access your paid community. This is much better compared to running an E-commerce business or selling products where your revenue is very unpredictable since you might get a lot of sales this month but there is no guarantee that you will also get a lot of sales next month. Meanwhile, the third reason is profit margin percentage, since you are selling a digital product, therefore, your profit margin will be significantly higher compared to selling a physical product since there are no production and fulfillment costs. Last but not least, building an online community will be very beneficial for both of you and your members as it allows you to generate sustainable passive income in exchange for providing them a community to grow, learn new things, and be surrounded by like minded people who have the same goal\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow are things that you are going to learn from this course:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn the basic fundamentals of subscription business model and get to know its KPI, such as monthly recurring revenue, retention rate, and cancellation rate\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to identify your niche and target the right audience\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to generate mini online course material using Mind Smith AI\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to generate Ebooks using Ebook Maker AI and Book Witch IO\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to create Discord server and add new channels\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to sell premium membership to your Discord server on Whop\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to create booking system for coaching appointment using Calendly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to add virtual community manager using Punky AI\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to sell premium membership to your Discord server on Launch Pass\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to build paid community with Mighty Networks\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to set up payment plan for your paid community\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to build paid community on Patreon\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to connect Discord server to Patreon\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to partner with content creators and help them to monetise their audience using paid community\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn several subscription pricing models like freemium model, tiered pricing, and discounted annual billing\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to promote your paid communities by implementing several strategies like social media promotion and building referral system\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/building-monetizing-paid-community-via-subscription-model/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5699050_9fb5.jpg","duration":"2 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"278.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["People who are interested in building, growing, and monetizing paid community via monthly subscription","Content creators or social media influencers who are interested in building paid community for their audience"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":0,"averageValue":"0.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"Christ Raharja","url":"/user/christ-raharja/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":0}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"33C08A52D4968AAE2421","originalPrice":"\u20B91,699","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/grants-for-nonprofit-organizations/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":2431770,"title":"Writing Grants Applications For Nonprofit Organizations","shortDescription":"Learn How To Write Grant Applications For Nonprofit Organizations","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EUpdated: February 2022\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHow To Access Top UK Grants!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you have a project or idea you are passionate about?

After this, we are going to build a comments system and this will be the biggest project in this course. We will begin first by doing a post system and then we will grab comments for every post that we have of course we will use Ajax-JQuery for inserting, deleting, and showing comments. after that, we will integrate a rating system into the previous two projects to make a bigger project. So, I will show how to download a JQuery plugin, how to integrate it and how to use it to do the rating system for every post, and so on. And the rating system is going to be implemented of course using Ajax-JQuery. The upcoming project is going to be also created with Ajax and JQuery and that\u0027s a live search system and we will combine it with our big project. The last project will be about building a weather app. All we are going to do is set up a form, allow the user to enter a city, and then give him the current degree of this city.

This is crucial for creating reusable code in large-scale applications. When you use generics, you provide a way to ensure type safety without losing the flexibility of working with different types. For instance, a generic function or class can work with a variety of types rather than a single one, which is essential for building scalable and maintainable applications. This feature is especially important in TypeScript as it enhances JavaScript\u0027s dynamic nature with a robust typing system, leading to fewer runtime errors and more predictable code behavior.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EQuestion:\u003C/strong\u003E What is the benefit of using TypeScript\u0027s Union Types?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA) To declare variables of multiple types.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB) To define an array of mixed types.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EC) To enhance runtime performance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ED) To automatically infer types.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECorrect Answer: A) To declare variables of multiple types.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EExplanation:\u003C/strong\u003E Union Types in TypeScript are an elegant way to allow a variable to store values of multiple types, enhancing the flexibility of your type-checking. This feature is particularly useful when a variable might genuinely hold different types of values under different circumstances. By using Union Types, developers can create more dynamic and adaptable code without sacrificing the safety and predictability of strict type-checking. This concept is a cornerstone of TypeScript\u0027s design, balancing flexibility with robustness, and is a frequent topic in interviews as it tests the developer\u0027s understanding of advanced typing concepts in TypeScript.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EQuestion:\u003C/strong\u003E Why is the \u0027any\u0027 type considered a last resort in TypeScript?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA) Because it disables type-checking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB) Because it is not supported in all TypeScript versions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EC) Because it reduces code readability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ED) Because it increases runtime errors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECorrect Answer: A) Because it disables type-checking.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EExplanation:\u003C/strong\u003E The \u0027any\u0027 type in TypeScript is often considered a last resort because it effectively turns off TypeScript\u2019s type-checking for a variable. When a variable is of type \u0027any\u0027, it can hold any value without any constraints, which defeats the purpose of TypeScript\u0027s robust type system. While this might seem useful in situations where you don\u0027t know the type of value in advance, using \u0027any\u0027 extensively can lead to a loss of type safety, making the code more error-prone and defeating the purpose of using TypeScript over JavaScript. This topic is crucial in interviews as it touches on TypeScript\u0027s core value proposition - enhancing JavaScript with a type system for safer, more reliable code.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EQuestion:\u003C/strong\u003E What is the primary use of TypeScript Decorators?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA) To optimize the performance of methods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB) To add annotations and a meta-programming syntax.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EC) To ensure code runs in strict mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ED) To automatically bind methods to their class instance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECorrect Answer: B) To add annotations and a meta-programming syntax.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EExplanation:\u003C/strong\u003E Decorators in TypeScript are a significant feature borrowed from languages like Python and Java. They provide a way to add both annotations and a meta-programming syntax for declaratively modifying classes and properties at design time. Decorators allow developers to modify or annotate class declarations and members without altering the actual code, leading to cleaner, more readable code that is easier to maintain. This feature is extensively used in modern TypeScript frameworks like Angular for Dependency Injection, and understanding its use is often a key part of TypeScript interviews.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EQuestion:\u003C/strong\u003E Why are TypeScript interfaces important for defining complex type structures?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA) To enhance code compilation speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB) To simplify debugging.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EC) To describe the shape of an object.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ED) To automatically initialize properties.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECorrect Answer: C) To describe the shape of an object.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EExplanation:\u003C/strong\u003E Interfaces in TypeScript are powerful tools for defining the structure of complex objects, arrays, and functions. They are essential for ensuring that various parts of your code agree on the structure of certain data. Unlike classes, interfaces are completely stripped away at runtime and exist purely for compile-time type checking. By using interfaces, developers can define custom types without creating classes, leading to more predictable and safer code. This concept is especially important in TypeScript for maintaining a consistent contract across different parts of your application, which is a common discussion point in TypeScript interviews. \u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJoin \u0022Master TypeScript: Practice Tests for Interview Success\u0022 and elevate your TypeScript skills to confidently tackle any interview question.

A Burndown Chart is an essential Agile artifact used to visualize the work left versus time. It helps teams understand if they are on track to complete the work by the end of the Sprint. While other options like tracking team morale or showing completed user stories are important, they are not the primary function of a Burndown Chart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhich statement best defines a User Story in Agile?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA) A detailed specification of software features\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB) A short, simple description of a feature told from the perspective of the end user\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EC) A technical requirement for system developers\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ED) A long, detailed description of the application\u2019s functionality\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EExplanation:\u003C/strong\u003E B) A short, simple description of a feature told from the perspective of the end user is the correct answer.

In Scrum, the Product Owner has a pivotal role in ensuring that the product backlog is well-maintained, prioritized, and transparent. They are responsible for articulating the product goals, ordering the items in the Product Backlog to best achieve goals and missions, and ensuring the value of the work the Development Team performs.

The Daily Stand-up, or Daily Scrum, is a short meeting for the development team to synchronize their work and plan for the next 24 hours. This meeting helps identify blockers and dependencies among team members but is not meant for problem-solving, detailed discussions, or status updates for stakeholders. The primary focus is on progress towards the Sprint goal and immediate next steps. \u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEnroll Now to Transform Your Agile Knowledge and Interview Skills\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake the first step towards Agile mastery.
