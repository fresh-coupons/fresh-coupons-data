We then return to the fundamentals of scrum master by applying scrum master principles in agile methodologies. Agile project management requires specialization in tools for efficient project management and delivery. These tools include Pivotal tracker, Team foundation server-based apps like TFS console, Visual studio, Git, etc. The next section of the course dives right into the Pivotal tracker and its usability. Here we learn different terms with a pivotal tracker and their roles and responsibility within project management. We also get to learn project analytics and automation in a pivotal tracker. We next learn Microsoft\u2019s Team Foundation Server (TFS) to deploy, configure, and manage according to team requirements. TFS comes with an array of software components like visual studio, Git, SQL server to build project-driven apps.
