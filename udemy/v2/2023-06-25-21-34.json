(All the Books of the Bible) That passion drew me to seriously consider his engaging presentation. The instructor challenged me to see myself through the eyes of my Lord and Savior - not the eyes of the world! I learned many valuable teachings about the Book of Philippians by taking this course. That is a credit to the instructor preparing a very detailed and organized course that is easy to follow. The course provided me the opportunity to reflect on my walk with the Lord, and my lack of commitment to thoroughly read and learn from God\u0027s written word on a daily basis. I will never find my true path (God\u0027s will for my life) if I remain a lukewarm Bible studying believer in the Lord, Jesus Christ! It is impossible for a born again Christian to seldom study the Bible, pray without ceasing or draw closer to God in a reconciled relationship while following the secular world. This course has reignited the fire that once was within me to learn from the Bible daily. I praise the Lord for Boomy Tokan who followed the Holy Spirit\u0027s prompting in preparing and sharing this course. I look forward to taking the other courses that Boomy has prepared.

I am so glad you chose to watch this video.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWay back in 2009, I first heard about this fantastic new 3D app called BLENDER. You could create 3D models, and it was FREE!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the time, there was primarily expensive software, and that wasn\u0027t in my budget.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBlender is easy to learn, and everyone is learning 3D. It\u0027s the future!

What am I looking at? What do I do?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI closed it and never opened it until a year later.

I said things like, \u0022I just a 2d artist, and I can just draw whatever I need\u0022 or \u00223D is not my thing, it looks cool but\u0022 or my favorite \u0022I have no reason to learn 3D.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I secretly knew the power of 3D and how it could speed up my workflow, and I knew that other 2D artists used it all the TIME.
