Digital cameras\u003Cstrong\u003E \u003C/strong\u003Eare built into doorbells; your smartphone tracks your daily movements from work to home and back; and you receive social media updates when you go to the gym, see a show, or visit a new city. Digital technology tracks your phone calls, bank transactions, and medical appointments.

There is almost no criminal activity that does not involve digital evidence, and it is your responsibility as an investigator to gather all available evidence, process it, and present your findings to the authorities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInvestigators who work in the field of digital forensics must have a diverse set of skills and interests. The first question I ask anyone thinking about a career in this field is if they enjoy solving puzzles. You may not have access to any information other than the fact that something happened when investigating a case. So, if someone needs to be shown or told what happened, this field may not be right for them. When a case is brought to an investigator\u0027s attention, the investigator is often given instructions to figure out what the computer or device was used for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother important trait is the ability to deal with frustration, as investigative tools and software do not always work without problems. When it comes to cell phones and small devices, this is a fairly common occurrence. Many students, rather than working through the challenges, stop their investigation in class at the first sign of difficulty. They don\u0027t even try to figure out what\u0027s wrong with the tool by looking at the web or using the help system. To be a successful investigator, one must be persistent and creative \u2013 they must be problem solvers. Digital forensics is a branch of forensic science that collects, analyses, documents, and presents digital evidence related to computer crime for use in a court of law using scientific knowledge. Knowing what was done, when it was done, and who did it is the ultimate goal. The term \u201Cdigital forensics\u201D is often used interchangeably with \u201Ccomputer forensics\u201D (also known as \u201Ccyber forensics\u201D), but it has come to encompass all devices capable of storing digital data, including networking devices, mobile phones, tablets, digital cameras, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, digital home appliances, and other digital storage media such as CD/DVD, USB drives, SD cards, external drives, and backup tapes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComputer Forensics is a specialization that deals with the recovery, examination and investigation of digital evidence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComputer Forensics is an applied science that deals with the recovery, examination and investigation of digital evidence.

The process of writing the software itself involves the planning required for developing the product. The key principle of the RAD process is a reduction in planning to focus on a highly iterative design and construction process, enabling teams to accomplish more in less time, without impacting client satisfaction. Apart from a shorter time-to-market, one of the most significant advantages of RAD is client involvement. RAD emphasizes incremental and iterative delivery of functioning models to the client instead of following a rigid process model like the traditional SDLC.

And make no mistake, art galleries are a business. While you don\u0027t have to go it alone, having a passion for art is only part of the equation! Of course, both a love of art and a creative interest in artists are meaningful to becoming an art gallery owner.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArt galleries are big business, contributing to a $45 billion dollar global industry based on this model.

Bloomberg reports that the average profit margin for this kind of business is 6.5 percent. Obviously, the amount of profit is tied to the amount of art sold and the price of that art. Almost every art gallery \u2013 at least, every successful art gallery that\u0027s able to stick around long-term \u2013 makes money in some way. Most art galleries aren\u0027t in it for the money, but of course, they need some revenue in order to keep their doors open.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn collaboration with many collectors and artists, \u201Cgallery owners\u201D have also defined a set of criteria for evaluating the professionalism of galleries: loyalty to artists, commitment to their success, ethics, accessibility to the public, provision of services to collectors and more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA commercial gallery is a for-profit business with a transactional model: collectors buy pieces of artwork on display so both the gallery and the artist get a cut of the revenue.

in Leadership, How is Leadership Defined?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are many definitions of leadership. Many lines have been written attempting to capture the essence in just a few words.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Oxford English Dictionary definition of leadership is simply:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022\u003Cem\u003EThe action of leading a group of people or an organisation, or the ability to do this \u003C/em\u003E.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe need now to define \u0027lead\u0027 in this context, which is more helpful with regards to appreciating the breadth and depth of the word \u0027leadership\u0027. Here are the most relevant points from the dictionary:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBe in charge or command\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrganise and direct\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESet a process in motion\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBe a reason or motive for (others to act, change, etc.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that only the first point strongly implies that leadership depends on a single leader, and even this point may easily be interpreted to mean that it can be achieved by delegated responsibility, even across a number of levels and on a vast scale.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso consider that the last two points do not restrict leadership to the leading of an organised group of people such as a business or other provider of services/products, etc. The last two points broaden the scope to anyone or any collective of people, who inspire or motivate other people to act in some way towards some sort of aim or task or outcome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEffective leadership requires collaboration between the leaders and the followers.

Any person who wants to be a leader needs to have a great degree of discipline. Leaders are also committed to learning and self-improvement.

It varies from person to person, but let\u0027s just say you probably won\u0027t master these in your first few months.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdvanced SEO typically involves technical concepts that are somewhat advanced, and/or a deeper understanding of the workings of Google\u0027s algorithm and are often employed by Professional SEOs. Anyone can master advanced concepts with the right strategic guidance and real life application.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAccording to Griffin, Search engine optimization is the science of improving a website to increase its visibility when people search for products or services. The more visibility a website has on search engines, the more likely it is that brand captures business.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWebsite visibility is commonly measured by the placement -- or ranking -- of the site on search engine results pages (SERPs). And companies always vie for the first page, where they are most likely to garner the most attention.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing Google as an example, SERPs often feature ads at the top of the page. These are positions that businesses are willing to pay for to ensure placement on that first page. Following ads are the regular search listings, which marketers and search engines refer to as organic search results. The SEO process aims to increase a business\u0027s organic search results, driving organic search traffic to the site. This enables data marketers to distinguish between traffic that comes to a website from other channels -- such as paid search, social media, referrals and direct -- and the organic search traffic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrganic search traffic is usually higher-quality traffic because users are actively searching for a specific topic, product or service for which a site might rank. If a user finds that site through the search engine, it can lead to better brand engagement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow does SEO work? While there is a way to maximize results, it is almost impossible to fully manipulate search algorithms. Businesses often look to the shortest path toward ideal results with the least amount of effort, but SEO requires a lot of action and time. There is no SEO strategy where something can be changed today with the expectation of clear results tomorrow. SEO is a long-term project, with daily action and constant activity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch engines use bots to crawl all website pages, downloading and storing that information into a collection known as an index. This index is like a library and when someone searches for something in it, the search engine acts as the librarian. The search engine pulls and displays relevant information from the search query and shows users content related to what they were looking for. Search engine algorithms analyze webpages in the index to determine the order those pages should be displayed on the SERP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this master course, you can learn about 5 major topics,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

In a small business, you might not be able to afford motivational speakers, but you are a public speaker each day for your staff.

By practicing public speaking, you learn how to prepare a message for each type of audience. For example, you would prepare a different speech for a fund-raising dinner than you would for a parent-teacher conference. Over time, you learn to think on your feet, taking information from the social environment and changing your communication patterns to suit the occasion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EImportance of Clear Expression\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA small business needs employees who can communicate what they\u0027re thinking in a clear manner. When you work for someone else, you can improve these skills over time. When you work for yourself as a small business owner, you need to express yourself clearly every day, especially when you\u0027re dealing with customers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EImportance of Working With Diverse Audiences\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour skills in public speaking are tested when you must perform different jobs that are really public speaking in disguise. For example, if you must interview people for a job opening in your organization, you will get diverse candidates. You must be able to talk with them in person or on the phone and determine whether they have the combination of qualities to succeed in the job. You will have to communicate with them frequently if they join your work organization.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EImportance for Leadership\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of all, public speaking skills are important for leaders. Whether you serve as a president of a civic group or run a small firm, you must communicate with an intent, such as to persuade, to inform or to motivate. You should be able to ask questions, state what your organization needs, represent a position on an issue, respond to other people\u0027s opinions and build consensus. If you cannot communicate clearly and motivate others through public speaking, it will be harder to realize your goals for your small business.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this master course you can learn five major topics, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

However, it is not scalable as different pairs of users need to generate keys for their communication, leading to a large number of keys.

The goal of computer forensics is to perform a structured investigation and maintain a documented chain of evidence to find out exactly what happened on a computing device and who was responsible for it. Computer forensics -- which is sometimes referred to as computer forensic science essentially is data recovery with legal compliance guidelines to make the information admissible in legal proceedings. The terms digital forensics and cyber forensics are often used as synonyms for computer forensics. Digital forensics starts with the collection of information in a way that maintains its integrity. Investigators then analyze the data or system to determine if it was changed, how it was changed and who made the changes. The use of computer forensics isn\u0027t always tied to a crime. The forensic process is also used as part of data recovery processes to gather data from a crashed server, failed drive, reformatted operating system (OS) or other situation where a system has unexpectedly stopped working.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy is computer forensics important?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the civil and criminal justice system, computer forensics helps ensure the integrity of digital evidence presented in court cases.
