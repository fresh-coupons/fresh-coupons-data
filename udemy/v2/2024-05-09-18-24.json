This helps significantly to configure the environment and make tests work, especially in case students didn\u0027t work with any testing framework in the past.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E- Q\u0026amp;A support\u0026nbsp; \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe significant difference between the online and offline learning process is the instructor\u0027s availability.
