The instructor challenged me to see myself through the eyes of my Lord and Savior - not the eyes of the world! I learned many valuable teachings about the Book of Philippians by taking this course. That is a credit to the instructor preparing a very detailed and organized course that is easy to follow. The course provided me the opportunity to reflect on my walk with the Lord, and my lack of commitment to thoroughly read and learn from God\u0027s written word on a daily basis. I will never find my true path (God\u0027s will for my life) if I remain a lukewarm Bible studying believer in the Lord, Jesus Christ! It is impossible for a born again Christian to seldom study the Bible, pray without ceasing or draw closer to God in a reconciled relationship while following the secular world. This course has reignited the fire that once was within me to learn from the Bible daily. I praise the Lord for Boomy Tokan who followed the Holy Spirit\u0027s prompting in preparing and sharing this course. I look forward to taking the other courses that Boomy has prepared.

Hashing is one of the corner stones of cyber security and knowing how to crack hashes is essential for Ethical Hackers. Many passwords are stored in a hash format, the hash function is used in many places including for Windows passwords, Linux passwords and often for databases of web apps. Database leaks often contain password hashes, but what to do with them? You can crack them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are many tools which you can use for hash cracking, one of them is John the Ripper. John the ripper is a fast password cracker, currently available for many flavors of Unix and Windows. The program uses word mangling, permutations, pattern matching, and some other tricks. John runs on multiple operating systems. It\u0027s also highly multithreaded and can make use of multiprocessor systems, which means it can make use of the complete power of your server cluster. In this course we\u0027ll also cover some other tools for hash cracking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this Ethical Hacking course you will learn how to crack various hashes including Windows password hashes and all the common hash formats.

Even if you\u2019re just looking to build profile, you need a strong internet presence, if you want people to know you exist. The purpose of Digital Marketing is to raise awareness, connect with people who are interested in what you\u2019re offering, and persuade them to take actions you want. It uses digital forms of communication like the web, smartphones, social media platforms, and search engines, as a medium to reach potential customers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust like traditional marketing, digital marketing, is about finding prospective customers and broadcasting your message to them in the right place, in the right tone, and at the right time. Digital Marketing has one major advantage over traditional marketing as you can use analytics tools to monitor your campaigns in real time, so you can swiftly adjust your approach. Typically, it would cost more and take longer to make these kinds of adjustments, but with Digital Marketing it\u2019s easier to course correct than it would be if you had invested in a print ad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWHAT IS SOCIAL MEDIA?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESocial Media is an umbrella term to describe online platforms focused on community-based communication, such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Platforms like this use content sharing and post interaction, and most of there is content produced being from the users not the owners of the platform. Social media also includes curation sites such as wikis, as well as professional networking platforms like LinkedIn. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDue to the massive reach of Social Media, good social media marketing skills are now essential for anyone looking to attract the maximum number of customers online.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWHAT IS SEO?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESEO, or Search engine optimisation, is the science of attracting specific types of traffic to a website using a search engine. To master SEO, you need to create high-value content with high authority backlinks and include keywords in that content that your ideal customers search for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESEO is never a one size fits all solution, to be successful, you must take a bespoke approach. That means you need to optimise your site for the type of search engine you want it to rank highly on, like Google, Amazon, or Bing. SEO typically focuses on scoring highly organic search results, not paid or sponsored traffic, but you can also use it in paid ads, to maximise their reach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs search engines attempt to give the most suitable answer to each person\u2019s search query, you must ensure a search engine views your site as the most appropriate match. Every search engine uses a different algorithm to determine what the best result to a search query is. This will include a combination of different factors, including the quality of your content and backlinks, how many visitors your site has, and your website\u2019s speed and uptime.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModern SEO is complex, and mastering it takes more than just getting the right meta tags. It includes understanding how rich snippets, video, and featured snippets work to enhance your rankings as well as the importance of voice search and Video SEO. If you want to be successful using Google Search, you also need to understand how Google Rank Brain scores your website and must optimise your site to score highly on Google\u2019s algorithm.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELocal SEO is also becoming more critical, and you will need to learn the basics of this, especially since nearly half of all Google searches now have a local intent. Near Me searches have grown even faster, exploding at a rate of 150% more than local searches alone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMastering SEO also includes understanding Technical SEO, which focuses on priming your website for crawling and indexing by search engines. It\u2019s important you don\u2019t neglect this aspect, as without it search engines will find it much more difficult to access, crawl, and index your website. As a result, you will rank much lower. The reason this process is referred to as \u201CTechnical SEO\u201D is because it has nothing to do with promoting your website and or the type of SEO you include in your content.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWHEN YOU ENROL, YOU CAN USE AND CUSTOMISE OUR 23 CONTENT MARKETING TEMPLATES\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis how to Content Marketing, Social Media \u0026amp; SEO guide contains every essential type of example you\u2019ll ever need to empower your business:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFacebook Ad Template 1\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFacebook Ad Template 2\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding Page Template\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMini Story Email\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEmail Teaser\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEmail Welcome Template\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESales Letter Template\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Detailed Listicle (Blogging)\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Product Comparison (Blogging)\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe How-to Comprehensive Guide (Blogging)\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGuest Blog Outreach Template\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELinkedIn Ad Template\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOutreach template for LinkedIn\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwitter Ad Template\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwitter Post Template\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYouTube Video Description Template\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstagram Post Template\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstagram Ad Template\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPress Release Template\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInfluencer Outreach Template\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBacklink Outreach Template 1\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBacklink Outreach Template 2\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETemplate to ask for Social Shares from Influencers\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u2019ll see what you need to do - and why - and can tweak our practical samples so they suit your own needs exactly.

The best type of headers are short and punchy, with enough impact to arouse curiosity, or provoke a reaction. Incorporating numbers is a great way to make headers sound more specific: like 10 Top tips to get ripped fast, or 5 PRO ways to protect your privacy online. Don\u2019t just cast out clickbait headers that bear no relation to your content, or people will lose trust in you and switch off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDON\u2019T SHY AWAY FROM EMOTION\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile it\u2019s true that dropping stats and facts helps you build trust and credibility, if you do this too much, you\u2019ll end up boring people. Your copy needs a human element to be relatable, and one of the most powerful ways to achieve this is making your content emotional. Use high impact words, and share funny stories, or situations your audience can relate to, so that they can put themselves right in the scenario. When you add an element of personality, you\u2019ll make your followers feel closer to you than to other content creators who play it safe and stick to the facts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIDENTIFY YOUR AUDIENCE\u2019S PAIN POINTS\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPain points are problems people stress about and look for a solution too. Your job as a marketer is to emphasise these pain points but in a way that hints YOU can provide the solution. To find out your potential customer\u2019s pain points, you must do market research on your target demographic, to identify their fears, desires, and needs. Market research doesn\u2019t have to be conventional, if your typical customer hangs on out Reddit, why not monitor what they post about and use this to make your copy hold more appeal? When you stress customer\u2019s pain points, you should also highlight the importance of immediate action. Let your your audience know they must act now\u003Cem\u003E \u003C/em\u003Eif they want the solution.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELEARN SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMISATION (SEO)\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESEO, or Search engine optimisation, is the science of attracting specific types of traffic to a website using a search engine. To master SEO, you need to create high-value content with high authority backlinks and include keywords in that content that your ideal customers search for. SEO is never a one size fits all solution, to be successful, you must take a bespoke approach. SEO typically focuses on scoring highly organic search results, not paid or sponsored traffic, but you can also use it in paid ads, to maximise their reach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs search engines attempt to give the most suitable answer to each person\u2019s search query, you must ensure a search engine views your site as the most appropriate match. Every search engine uses a different algorithm to determine what the best result to a search query is. This will include a combination of different factors, including the quality of your content and backlinks, how many visitors your site has, and your website\u2019s speed and uptime.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModern SEO is complex, and mastering it takes more than just getting the right meta tags. It includes understanding how rich snippets, video, and featured snippets work to enhance your rankings as well as the importance of voice search and Video SEO. If you want to be successful using Google Search, you also need to understand how Google Rank Brain scores your website and must optimise your site to score highly on Google\u2019s algorithm.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELocal SEO is also becoming more critical, and you will need to learn the basics of this, especially since nearly half of all Google searches now have a local intent. Near Me searches have grown even faster, exploding at a rate of 150% more than local searches alone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMastering SEO also includes understanding Technical SEO, which focuses on priming your website for crawling and indexing by search engines. It\u2019s important you don\u2019t neglect this aspect, as without it search engines will find it much more difficult to access, crawl, and index your website. As a result, you will rank much lower. The reason this process is referred to as \u201CTechnical SEO\u201D is because it has nothing to do with promoting your website and or the type of SEO you include in your content.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause of the amount of online content we consume, demand for skilled SEO experts and pro copywriters has grown massively. More brands than ever require well-written content, that\u2019s optimised to perform well in search. If you can combine the two, you\u2019ll have a huge competitive advantage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWHEN YOU ENROL, YOU ALSO GET:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECOURSE MATERIALS AND TUITION Worth AT LEAST $1080 - you get it all - for a tiny fraction of the cost!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E23 PRO CONTENT MARKETING TEMPLATES ready for download\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHandy PDF \u0026amp; MP3 packed with useful and FREE EXTRA RESOURCES you can download from our Resource Centre\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuizzes \u0026amp; Assignments\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELifetime access \u0026amp; Lifetime updates\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUdemy certificate of completion - ready for download\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E30-day money back guarantee\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFast \u0026amp; friendly support in the Q\u0026amp;A section - ask me a question ANYTIME\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECOPYWRITING HAS BECOME ONE OF THE MOST IN-DEMAND SKILLS OF 2022.
