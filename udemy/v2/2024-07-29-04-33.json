It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E* Javascript Course Contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Introduction\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Array\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Variables\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Functions\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Objects\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Control Statements\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Cookies\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Loop statements\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Data Structures\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Error Handling\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJavascript Regular Expressions\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESee you inside the course\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThank you see you inside the course\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/css-and-javascript-complete-course-for-beginners/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4282170_1ea0.jpg","duration":"4 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"109,986.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["For People New to CSS And JavaScript","For People Who want to learn CSS And JavaScript Fundamentals and later Transition into Web Designing","For People New to Web Designing"],"tags":["CSS","JavaScript"],"rating":{"count":1511,"averageValue":"4.3"},"instructors":[{"name":"PROPER DOT INSTITUTE","url":"/user/vivek-dahibhate-2/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.30597}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"746E43D0801482E84F70","originalPrice":"\u20B91,999","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"3 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-jquery-course-learn-from-beginner-to-advanced/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5816906,"title":"Complete jQuery Course: Learn From Beginner To Advanced","shortDescription":"Learn the jQuery Course Beginner To Advanced and  Fast and Easily with This Comprehensive jQuery Guide.","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the \u0022Complete jQuery Course: Learn From Beginner To Advanced,\u0022 your comprehensive guide to mastering one of the most popular and powerful JavaScript libraries for web development.

A successful manager is now expected to act as a leader, a mentor, and a coach, guiding their team members towards individual and collective success. This paradigm shift highlights the significance of coaching techniques in the realm of managerial responsibilities.","The Transformation of Managerial Roles  Evolving Leadership Expectations  The traditional image of a manager as a stern authority figure has given way to a more holistic view of leadership. Managers are now expected to serve as role models, motivators, and mentors to their teams. This shift stems from the recognition that employees perform at their best when they feel valued, supported, and empowered.  The evolution of leadership expectations can be traced back to the changing dynamics of the modern workplace. In the past, managers were primarily responsible for enforcing rules and ensuring productivity. However, as organizations began to realize that employee engagement and satisfaction were crucial for success, a transformation in managerial roles ensued.  Today, managers are not just tasked with overseeing tasks and projects; they are expected to inspire and empower their teams. This shift is partly a response to the changing nature of work itself. In a knowledge-based economy, where creativity, innovation, and adaptability are paramount, traditional top-down management no longer suffices.","Coaching as a Leadership Skill  Coaching has emerged as a pivotal leadership skill that fosters personal and professional growth. We\u0027ll explore how coaching techniques, such as active listening, constructive feedback, and goal-setting, can empower managers to become effective leaders who inspire and guide their teams towards excellence.  Coaching is not a one-size-fits-all approach; it is a dynamic and personalized method of leadership. Effective coaches adapt their style to the needs and preferences of individual team members. They actively listen to understand the unique challenges and aspirations of each employee, fostering a sense of trust and rapport.  Moreover, coaching is not merely about providing solutions but guiding employees to discover answers themselves. This approach instills a sense of ownership and accountability in team members. It encourages them to take the initiative, think critically, and develop problem-solving skills\u2014a valuable asset in today\u0027s fast-paced, ever-changing business landscape.  Coaching also plays a crucial role in setting and achieving goals. Effective managers use coaching techniques to collaboratively define clear, actionable objectives with their team members.

In an era marked by rapid technological advancements and industry disruptions, employees recognize the importance of continuous learning and skill enhancement to remain relevant and competitive.  This heightened emphasis on career development places managers at the forefront of helping their team members chart their professional journeys. Coaching knowledge equips managers with the ability to provide guidance that is not only aligned with the organization\u0027s needs but also tailored to the aspirations of individual employees.  One of the key advantages of coaching in career development is its ability to facilitate self-awareness. Effective coaches help employees identify their strengths, weaknesses, interests, and values. Armed with this self-knowledge, employees can make informed career decisions that align with their passions and long-term goals.","The Manager as a Career Development Partner  Explore the responsibilities of middle and top managers in preparing and mentoring personal development plans for their team members.

Exploring this topic is as challenging as it is interesting. But while there may exist many depictions and images on temples and tomb walls that describe in detail the pharaonic home and kitchen, as well as the kinds of foods offered on almost all occasions from the dawn of the Predynastic era, the ancient Egyptians did not leave behind any recipes. As such it remains difficult, as one can imagine,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eto specify weights, measurements, and methods of preparation with any clear precision.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDue to the specific cultural heritage of each area, ways of cooking may differ from one place to another, helping to individualize that region despite the similarity of ingredients. In Lower Egypt, or the Delta, for example, there has been a consecutive influence of Greeks and Romans, foreign immigration, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of these have directly impacted food and cooking habits as well as recipe variations, and the modern Egyptian kitchen in this region is the outcome of these influences.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut this has not been the case with southern Egypt (Upper Egypt and Nubia), where cooking methods and ingredients have likely remained\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eunchanged since the days of the pharaohs due to the relative lack of foreign influences in the area. Very early on in the project it quickly became apparent that cooking methods in Upper Egypt and Nubia\u2014regions that have always been strongly insular, adhering closely to ancient cultures and inherited traditions\u2014have retained a pharaonic influence in their simplicity, their tendency to use few ingredients and spices, and their preference for vegetables, grains, spices, and herbs indigenous to the region. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Es noted earlier, the ancient Egyptians left few if any recipes, so the ingredients in this course have been slightly modified to suit modern tastes. While certain foods were not introduced into Egypt until after the pharaonic age (including sugar, lemon, tomatoes, chicken, and chilli, among others), they have found their way into the modern-day southern Egyptian kitchen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Pharaoh\u2019s Kitchen has been compiled with the aim of thoroughly exploring ancient Egyptian cooking, from both historical and social perspectives. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003EHome and Kitchen Pharaonic Homes \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E A\u003C/strong\u003Encient Egyptian houses differed according to the social and economic class of their residents, ranging from small, basic structures for peasants and laborers to more elaborate homes for artists, priests, and men of state, villas for nobles, and palaces for kings. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKitchen Planning and Cooking Tools \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehe kitchen was located at the back of the house and would be covered by a roof of straw or branches to simultaneously block out the scorching Egyptian heat and allow the escape of cooking fumes. In villas, the kitchen was located entirely outside the house. A grain storehouse would serve the kitchen, sometimes being located alongside it or on the roof where it could be reached by stairs.The kitchen area would be constructed along simple lines. In one corner there would be an oven covered in a layer of mud or a stove. There would also be one or two stone structures for the grinding of grains, or a tool \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPots and Vessels\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAncient Egyptians used the rich soil of the Nile bank to make pottery.

Food sources were diverse, and ancient Egyptians made good use of the different kinds of fish, vegetables, poultry, and fruits. The staple diet of most Egyptians consisted of bread and beer in addition to what produce the land yielded, such as onions, garlic, lentils, leeks, turnips, radish, lettuce, and cucumbers. Since the Predynastic period, ancient Egyptians, rich or poor, consumed various breads made from different grains. Flour would generally be mixed with a yeasting agent, salt, and spices, and sometimes with eggs and butter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe bread could also be filled with legumes or vegetables or sweetened with honey or dates. The ancient Egyptians also used a fair share of legumes such as beans, chickpeas, and lentils as well as vegetables such as peas, lettuce, garlic, onions, and leeks. Dates were the most common fruit, in addition to figs, grapes, pomegranates, watermelon and plums, all of which appear in depictions of daily life dating back to the New Kingdom. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFood and Social Status\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETypes of food eaten give a clearer picture of the different social levels in the ancient Egyptian hierarchy. In the poorest stratum fell the peasants whose staple diet was bread and beer, and a few simple dishes of vegetables the land generously yielded to them.

Ancient Egyptians were easily satisfied with a few loaves of bread, a share of beer, some leeks, and onions. The numerous tomb reliefs that picture the many pleasures of food and drink were probably more indicative of the lives of the upper strata of society, like the higher civil servants, priests, landowners, and nobles. The masses would wait for feasts and special occasions for an excuse to indulge. They likely did not have to wait long as festivals were numerous, judging by the annual special occasions relating to the seasons, the Nile, sowing, harvesting, as well as coronations and funerals \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFood and the Gods\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ancient Egyptians identified spiritually with the forces of nature surrounding them, including the sun, moon, wind, the inundation of the Nile, the strength of fierce animals like lions, snakes, and crocodiles, or powerful animals that were of use to them like cows and bulls. There were many gods, one for each invisible force behind the phenomenon, thus becoming intertwined with the lives of the ancient Egyptians. They did not only worship tangible powers, but also less tangible ones symbolized by animals. For example, the force of wisdom was symbolized by the ibis of Thoth, and fertility by the bull.26 The deification of animals made them a symbol for a certain god or power, but it did not stop the ancients from using them for food, transport, or other purposes. Thus the cow was used for farming, and though the ancient Egyptians deified the crocodile, they didn\u2019t find anything \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Efood and language\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe hieroglyphs used by the ancients were numerous and pictorial: symbols of people, animals, tools and implements, as well as food items. The foods were not chosen randomly, but in fact were built on the importance of that symbol to the lives of the ancient Egyptians. Among the twenty-four letters of the ancient Egyptian alphabet, four are related to food: I was represented by a leaf of a plant. N was represented by water, the source of life. W was represented by a baby quail, one of the birds that were hunted. Quails are also migratory birds and so may have had special significance in certain times of the year. Finally, T was represented by a loaf of bread, the staple food. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBread \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBread was a staple of the ancient Egyptian diet, figuring in most depictions of offerings left in temples and tombs and on lists of desired\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efoods carried by the deceased.

The peasants themselves were careful to ensure that milking occurred in an atmosphere of calmness and safety. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDairy Products in Modern-day Upper Egypt\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECottage cheese, butter, and ghee, which was called seimi (from which came the name ghee in modern Egyptian, samna) are still used in Upper Egypt today. Ghee is made by melting the fat left over from cream after having extracted the milk by churning. In this case morta is extracted, that is the solid matter dissolved in milk after melting the butter. Morta is used to make mesh (aged cheese) by putting it in clay vessels and topping it with ovendried cottage cheese and some lupine beans (today, red hot chilli peppers \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMeat \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELivestock and hunted animals were an important source of nutrition in ancient Egypt.

They made use of grazing lands that conveniently grew naturally in the swamps of the fertile Delta and the pastures that would appear after the Nile flood and would last for a few months. They also knew how to raise many animals such as bulls, cows, sheep, and goats. Tomb reliefs show many scenes of slaughtering animals, especially bulls, which, in addition to their much-coveted meat, were used for agricultural purposes such as ploughing the land and crushing corn as well as pulling heavy loads such as construction blocks. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPoultry\u003C/strong\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eas one of the main sources of food for ancient Egyptians, varying, as is the case today, from domesticated fowl to wild birds. In\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecities there were poultry merchants who raised birds and fattened them up in order to sell them. Game, the most popular of which was wild goose, was also hunted. Geese were also domesticated. Duck was a common bird and, along with geese, made popular grilled or boiled dishes gracing the banquets of kings and priests and people of status in the community. Scenes have been found depicting the process of fattening domesticated birds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther common birds were pigeons, quail, and ostrich, which were also domesticated. Pigeons were bred in silos of mudbrick, and their droppings used as fertilizer. Chicken was only introduced to Egypt later in the Ptolemaic period.43\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBird-hunting was a passion in ancient Egypt, whether as a profession for game hunters, or as a hobby practiced by kings, princes, and aristocrats. Quail, swans, sparrows, storks, and pigeons were fair game. Several methods were used to hunt birds. Boomerangs were known since the Predynastic period and were used in hunting swamp birds. Hunters hid in the rushes, waiting for the precise moment at which they could capture the bird by flinging their boomerangs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFish \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehe Nile was the backbone of ancient Egyptian life, providing water\u2014 both for drinking and agriculture\u2014a means of transport, and communication. There was an abundance of fish thriving in its waters. Many different varieties were available and the flooding of the Nile meant large catches that had to be preserved for storage by salting and drying. In some parts of the country, there were fish that were considered sacred, and couldn\u2019t be caught or eaten, like Nile perch or seasnake. In\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eother parts, it was taboo to eat fish on certain days of the year\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany tomb scenes depict fishing as well as different methods of preparing\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efish, including salting and drying.

During the Roman period up to twenty-five kinds of fish were identified, including pufferfish, seal, sand leaf, and electric fish.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ancient Egyptians excelled at preserving fish, salting, and dryingthem, as well as extracting roe.

A rod would be pushed through the mouth and the fish would be grilled over a fire. Fish could also be boiled in a pot filled with water, salt, and some spices. Certain kinds of fish were also smoked and salted. Salting was a convenient way to cook fish to avoid spoilage, especially in the hot weather, as it would keep fish edible for a very long time. Salted fish was a main meal for the Feast of the Harvest festival, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EVegetables \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehe fertile soil of the Nile provided a suitable climate for different crops such as grains and vegetables, many of which were represented in depictions of banquets and meals. Of the most commonly cultivated were onions which were also used in medicinal recipes as well as on special occasions. Known as a popular food for layman as well as priest, onions were commonly used to flavor dishes. Herodotus even mentioned onions and bread as the staple diet for pyramid builders. Apicius reports that onion was used as an ingredient in a sauce for grilled fish. Onions used to be worn as garlands by followers of Sokar, god of rebirth in Memphis \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECooking Vegetables in Ancient Egypt\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough numerous wall paintings and tomb reliefs have been found depicting fruits and vegetables, there is little to indicate the methods by which they were prepared. Onions, which were eaten raw, comprised a large portion of the ancient Egyptians\u2019 vegetable intake, and it is believed the ancients ate many of their vegetables raw. That said, it is likely the ancients also cooked vegetables in pots and pans after the addition of meat and fat \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELegumes \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELegumes were, and still are, a popular food. Plutarch mentions them as being offered to the gods in ancient Egypt, although the priests used to avoid them for fear of flatulence. Types of legumes consumed were beans, peas, chickpeas, crushed wheat, lentils, lupine beans and fenugreek. Herodotus mentioned that lentils were eaten by pyramid builders in the Old Kingdom. They were also used to make bread and as feed for animals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFound in the tombs of the Fifth Dynasty were eyorti (Egyptian beans), a name similar to the one used in Egypt now, herati. The ancient Egyptians cooked different kinds of beans in various ways. Beans were cooked the same way as peas and were also used in making besara. The latter was prepared by boiling crushed beans, mashing them into a smooth thick paste, then adding spices and herbs such as cumin, dry and fresh coriander, salt, parsley, and dry Jew\u2019s mallow. Beans were also allowed to sprouts and made into many dishes, from soup to fuliya with herbs \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFruits and Desserts \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFruits and Nuts in Ancient Egypt\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ancient Egyptians realized early on the huge nutritional benefit of grapes, and they ate them fresh, dried as raisins, and pressed into wine.

While grapes were not mentioned except in depictions from the Third Dynasty, wine vessels and a grape press were found that dated to the First Dynasty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe sycomore was considered a sacred tree, and its fruit was frequently found inside tombs. Melon was also often planted. Dates were eaten either fresh, or dried, and a type of wine was made out of them, just like the fig, which was also a popular fruit, eaten both fresh and pressed into wine. The soft part of the doum fruit, related to the palm, was eaten or the fruit was made into a dough or used as a sweetener. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBeverages \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecommon drinks were beer, bouza (fermented barley), wine, and milk (which was drunk fresh because of the hot weather).
