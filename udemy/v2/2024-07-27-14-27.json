Wieso sollte ich das lernen magst Du Dich fragen. Gerade in Zeiten in denen Javascript-basierte Frameworks wie Vue.js, Angular oder React scheinbar den Anpruch erheben, die Platzhirsche im Kampf um das \u0022geeignetste\u0022 Web-Framework zu sein.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENun bei der Entwicklung von Software und insbesondere bei der Auswahl geeigneter Technologien spielen verschiedene und vielseitige Faktoren eine Rolle.
