It is capable of doing everything similar to Windows batch file, but with more ease. Many system administrators are not familiar with Linux Bash scripting and thus do not find it useful. It is my opinion that any Linux sysadmin worth his or her salt, should learn how to use Bash scripting as soon as possible in order to automate their daily tasks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are a few reasons why Linux Bash scripting is so powerful. One reason is that it is very easy to use. Unlike Windows batch files, which can be quite complex and difficult to understand, Bash scripts are much simpler and easier to read. This makes them perfect for automating tasks that would otherwise be tedious and time-consuming.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAnother reason why Linux Bash scripting is so useful is because it is extremely versatile. It can be used for a wide range of tasks, from simple file management to complex system administration. In addition, Bash scripts can be easily modified and customized to meet the specific needs of any user or organization.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EFinally, Linux Bash scripting is very popular among experienced Linux users and administrators. This popularity means that there is a large community of users who are familiar with the script and who can offer support and advice when needed.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/linux-bash-scripting/","imageUri":"https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2267008_52a1_3.jpg","duration":"33 total mins","enrolledStudentsCount":"17,026.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Beginner Linux users","System administrators"],"tags":["Bash Shell"],"rating":{"count":211,"averageValue":"4.5"},"instructors":[{"name":"Peter A","url":"/user/peter-1943/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.4117646}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"INNOVATION","originalPrice":"\u20B91,199","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/kanban-ai-fundamentals-learn-how-to-become-more-productive/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5747374,"title":"Kanban AI Fundamentals: Learn How to become More Productive","shortDescription":"Master Agile Workflow, Optimize Resource Utilization, Enhance Task Management, and Streamline Processes with Kanban AI","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKanban\u003C/strong\u003E is a popular framework used to implement agile and DevOps software development.

commercial broiler farms should be prepared to receive new chicks. If litter has been recycled, it may be turned, treated, and/or otherwise managed to reduce ammonia, pathogen ,and insect load. Houses will be heated to provide adequate temperature for the chicks and feed and water lines may be primed so that they are at room temperature prior to placement. Temperature maybe uniform within houses or a temperature gradient may be provided to allow chicks to better\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eadjust their individual temperatures. If a temperature gradient is provided, feeders and waterers should be placed so that birds can adjust their temperature and still have easily access to feed and water. In general, chicks are placed at a ground temperature of approximately 90-95\u00B0F (32.2-35\u00B0C) and temperature is decreased as the birds age at approximately 5\u00B0F (2.8\u00B0C)/week until the temperature is around 70\u00B0F (21\u00B0C). However, this greatly varies based on the management system and breed of bird so temperature should be adjusted based on flock behavior . Many commercial broiler houses have some or extensive environmental control and the ability to implement standard program flock profiles for temperature and ventilation. Chickens in these environments Temperature \u0026amp; ventilation Uniformity of ventilation is ideal to improve flock performance. Poor ventilation may pro-mote excessive litter moisture and increase the exposure of the chickens to enteric pathogens. Poor ventilation may cause excessive ammonia levels, which could be detrimental to the health and welfare of animals and employees\u0026nbsp; Excessive ammonia at the level of the chicks may be less detectable to a standing human and high levels can cause health problems such as corneal ulceration, conjunctivitis, and inflammation/deciliation of the trachea thereby predisposing birds to respiratory pathogens. Broiler processing Based on market needs, broilers will be processed at a target weight or age determined by the individual company. Loading chickens into transport vehicles to move to processing may be done at night or early morning to decrease physical and heat stress during loading. At the processing plant, misting or fans may help keep birds cool and reduce mortality while birds are waiting to be processed. In colder regions, heating systems may be needed. Handling of birds at processing, including unloading and shackling, should be done in a way to minimize trauma to the birds, which would not only be a welfare concern but would lead to increased condemnations. Birds should be rendered unconscious and/or euthanizedin a manner that does not cause undue stress, increase condemnations, or adversely affect food safety.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/poultry-farming-broiler-farming-crash-course/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4750792_a09c_2.jpg","duration":"4 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"9,794.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["poultry farming lovers"],"tags":["Poultry Farming"],"rating":{"count":49,"averageValue":"3.6"},"instructors":[{"name":"Mohamed AL ashram","url":"/user/mohamed-taha-288/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":3.15}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"106F85FB9FCABAE345A7","originalPrice":"\u20B91,799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/poultry-farming-bacterial-diseases-hindering-satisfying-prod/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4744630,"title":"poultry farming Bacterial diseases hindering satisfying prod","shortDescription":"bacterial diseases of poultry","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003Eaclear example of poultry disease hinder satisfying poultry production is collibacillosis\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the localized or systemic infection caused by \u003Cem\u003Eavian pathogenic Escherichia Coli (APEC\u003C/em\u003E).

During early middle age, many bodily functions begin to gradually decline.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPeople do not become old or elderly at any specific age. Traditionally, age 65 has been designated as the beginning of old age. But the reason was based in history, not biology. Many years ago, age 65 was chosen as the age for retirement in Germany, the first nation to establish a retirement program. In 1965 in the United States, age 65 was designated as the eligibility age for Medicare insurance. This age is close to the actual retirement age of most people in economically advanced societies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen a person becomes old can be answered in different ways:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EChronologic age\u003C/strong\u003E is based solely on the passage of time. It is a person\u2019s age in years. Chronologic age has limited significance in terms of health. Nonetheless, the likelihood of developing a health problem increases as people age, and it is health problems, rather than normal aging, that are the primary cause of functional loss during old age. Because chronologic age helps predict many health problems, it has some legal and financial uses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBiologic age\u003C/strong\u003E refers to changes in the body that commonly occur as people age. Because these changes affect some people sooner than others, some people are biologically old at 65, and others not until a decade or more later. However, most noticeable differences in apparent age among people of similar chronologic age are caused by lifestyle, habit, and subtle effects of disease rather than by differences in actual aging.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPsychologic age\u003C/strong\u003E is based on how people act and feel. For example, an 80-year-old who works, plans, looks forward to future events, and participates in many activities is considered psychologically younger.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost healthy and active people do not need the expertise of a geriatrician (a doctor who specializes in the care of older people) until they are 70, 75, or even 80 years old. However, some people need to see a geriatrician at a younger chronologic age because of their medical conditions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENormal aging\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPeople often wonder whether what they are experiencing as they age is normal or abnormal. Although people age somewhat differently, some changes result from internal processes, that is, from aging itself. Thus, such changes, although undesired, are considered normal and are sometimes called \u0022pure aging.\u0022 These changes occur in everyone who lives long enough, and that universality is part of the definition of pure aging. The changes are to be expected and are generally unavoidable. For example, as people age, the lens of the eye thickens, stiffens, and becomes less able to focus on close objects, such as reading materials (a disorder called presbyopia). This change occurs in virtually all older people. Thus, presbyopia is considered normal aging. Other terms used to describe these changes are \u0022usual aging\u0022 and \u0022senescence.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eexactly what constitutes normal aging is not always clear. Changes that occur with normal aging make people more likely to develop certain disorders. However, people can sometimes take actions to compensate for these changes. For example, older people are more likely to lose teeth. But seeing a dentist regularly, eating fewer sweets, and brushing and flossing regularly may reduce the chances of tooth loss. Thus, tooth loss, although common with aging, is an avoidable part of aging.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, functional decline that is part of aging sometimes seems similar to functional decline that is part of a disorder. For example, with advanced age, a mild decline in mental function is nearly universal and is considered normal aging. This decline includes increased difficulty learning new things such as languages, decreased attention span, and increased forgetfulness. In contrast, the decline that occurs in dementia is much more severe. For example, people who are aging normally may misplace things or forget details, but people who have dementia forget entire events. People with dementia also have difficulty doing normal daily tasks (such as driving, cooking, and handling finances) and understanding the environment, including knowing what year it is and where they are. Thus, dementia is considered a disorder, even though it is common later in life. Certain kinds of dementia, such as Alzheimer disease, differ from normal aging in other ways as well. For example, brain tissue (obtained during autopsy) in people with Alzheimer disease looks different from that in older people without the disease. So the distinction between normal aging and dementia is clear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESometimes the distinction between functional decline that is part of aging and functional decline that is part of a disorder seems arbitrary. For example, as people age, blood sugar levels increase more after eating carbohydrates than they do in younger people. This increase is considered normal aging. However, if the increase exceeds a certain level, diabetes, a disorder, is diagnosed. In this case, the difference is one of degree only.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHealthy (successful) aging\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHealthy aging refers to postponement of or reduction in the undesired effects of aging. The goals of healthy aging are maintaining physical and mental health, avoiding disorders, and remaining active and independent. For most people, maintaining general good health requires more effort as they age. Developing certain healthy habits can help, such as\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFollowing a nutritious diet\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAvoiding cigarette smoking and excessive alcohol use\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExercising regularly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStaying mentally active\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe sooner a person develops these habits, the better. However, it is never too late to begin. In this way, people can have some control over what happens to them as they age.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome evidence suggests that in the United States, healthy aging is on the rise:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA decrease in the percentage of people aged 75 to 84 who report impairments\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA decrease in the percentage of people over age 65 with debilitating disorders\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn increase in the oldest old\u2014people age 85 and older, including those who have reached 100 (centenarians)\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAging is a natural process of structural decay that all living organisms undergo. It is caused by intrinsic processes (e.g., genomic instability and telomeric attrition) and interactions with the environment (e.g., exposure to sunlight and toxins). As aging is related to and dependent upon living and interacting with the environment, it has been associated with chronology since antiquity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eas human beings get older, the aging process results in many organic changes that must be anticipated and differentiated by the physician from the actual manifestations of a disease. For example, deposition of materials in the arterioles over the years can slightly increase systemic vascular resistance and ultimately blood pressure. On the other hand, the processes related to aging can play a major role in the pathophysiology of degenerative conditions such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Huntington\u2019s disease, and Parkinsonism.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor optimal comprehension, the medical student should be familiarized with organelles and their functions, genome replication, epigenetics, the basics of stem cells, and intercellular communication.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/aging-and-geriatrics/","imageUri":"https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5067800_0e26.jpg","duration":"2 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"4,924.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["any one take care of older people    , Nurses ,Pharmacists , physician ,old people seeking advice"],"tags":["Psychology"],"rating":{"count":9,"averageValue":"3.2"},"instructors":[{"name":"Mohamed AL ashram","url":"/user/mohamed-taha-288/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":3.6666667}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"70D063CCB45B2EB5180C","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/elisa-principals-and-applications-for-professionals/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5129970,"title":"ELISA principals and applications for professionals","shortDescription":"ELISA fundementals","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EEnzyme-linked immunosorbent Assay\u0026nbsp; (ELISA)\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E ELISA from fundamentals of immune system and the history of the\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eanalytical assay prior to the invention of ELISA to the materials of choice for\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efabrication of the platforms, possible biomolecular interactions, different protocols,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand evaluation parameters among the rest.

Epithelium, connective tissue, muscle tissue, and nervous tissue have commonalities but look very distinct structurally after staining. Each stain exists to highlight an important feature or component within a tissue type. For example, one of the most common stains, Hematoxylin, is a basic dye that stains proteins a blue color, while Eosin stains proteins a pink color. These two stains are commonly used together to define intracellular organelles and proteins. Because of the variety of the proteins that exist, some stains were created to highlight a particular protein, which this review will discuss in the following sections. The benefit of using a special stain is that it can highlight the specific protein very well. However, because of its specificity, the other structures will not be seen. For this reason, multiple slides will often be created from a given specimen so that multiple stains can be performed to gather the full range of needed information.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlmost all tissue stains are performed on tissue that has been removed from the body. However, in rare instances, very specialize stains called vital stains can work on tissue remaining in the body. These stains are used for the identification of specific types of tissue and identification of abnormal tissue, so a subsequent biopsy can be more accurate in obtaining abnormal tissue\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETissue Preparation\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore specific staining can occur, tissue samples must undergo preparation through the following stages: Fixation, processing, embedding, sectioning, and sometimes antigen retrieval. In modern histology laboratories, most of these steps are automated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E.\u003Cstrong\u003EFixation: \u003C/strong\u003EFixation uses chemicals to preserve the structure of the tissue in its natural form and protects it from degradation by irreversibly cross-linking proteins. Although several specialized fixatives are available, Neutral Buffered Formalin is a common choice for this step. The fixation step is vital to the rest of the histologic staining procedure because by retaining the chemical composition of the tissue, the sample is hardened and makes the sectioning phase easier. Paraffin-formalin is another effective fixative. Its benefit is that it is the fixative of choice for immunostaining; however, it requires preparation at the time of the fixation. Bouin is a fixative used for examining embryo and brain tissue because of its superior preservation of delicate nuclei and glycogen. Its downside is that it does not preserve kidney tissues well and also distorts mitochondrial structure.[1]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDehydration: \u003C/strong\u003EThe addition of ethanol accomplishes the dehydration of a sample. It removed water from the sample and further hardens the tissue for eventual light microscopy. After ethanol is applied, and following the completion of tissue dehydration, xylene is used to remove the ethanol.[1]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEmbedding: \u003C/strong\u003EEmbedding is the process of putting the sample into a paraffin wax or a plastic resin to enhance the process of extracting cellular structures. This step is to be performed with caution if the goal is to perform immunostaining because the paraffin wax will inhibit the penetration of antibodies, and lead to a false result.[1]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESectioning: \u003C/strong\u003ESectioning involves mounting the specimen on a microtome and cutting it into sections. The preferred thickness is 4-5 micrometers so that it can be stained and put on a microscope slide for examination.[1]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAntigen Retrieval: \u003C/strong\u003EThis step is to retrieve antigens that could have been covered in the fixation and embedding stages. If the cross-linking of proteins conceals the antigen sites, there may not be as robust of an immunohistochemical response. Antigen retrieval is achieved through heating and proteolytic methods to break down the cross-links and reveal the epitopes and antigens that were previously covered.[1] Although this step carries the risk of denaturing both the fixative and the antigens themselves, a successful antigen retrieval method can lead to a much more effective immunostaining intensity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/histology-step-by-step/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5080670_193b.jpg","duration":"1.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"2,350.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Medical students, science students ,nursing students ,medical protectional"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":3,"averageValue":"4.2"},"instructors":[{"name":"Mohamed AL ashram","url":"/user/mohamed-taha-288/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.1666665}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"F333900EC2A01F4A16BE","originalPrice":"\u20B93,499","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-php-and-mysql-for-web-application-and-web-development/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5381922,"title":"Learn PHP and MySQL for Web Application and Web Development","shortDescription":"Unlock the Power of PHP and MySQL: Level Up Your Web Development Skills Today","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the comprehensive PHP and MySQL Web Development course on Udemy!

It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables.
