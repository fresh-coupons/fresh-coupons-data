Remark, who found the fungal nature of favus in 1837 Berg who reported oral candidiasis in 1841 Wilkinson, who described vaginal candidiasis in 1849. Tinea versicolor was described clinically in 1846 by Eichstaedt, and its etiologic agent was identified in 1853. Beigel reported white Piedra in 1856 Piedra, which means \u0022stone\u0022 in Spanish, is an asymptomatic superficial fungal infection of the hair shaft. In 1865, Beigel first described Piedra in The Human Hair: Its Structure, Growth, Diseases, and Their Treatment; although, he may have been describing Aspergillus infection. Cerqueira, tinea nigra in 1891 In 1910 Raymond Sabouraud published his book Les Teignes, which was a comprehensive study of dermatophytic fungi. He is also regarded as father of medical mycology. In 1927, Nan Nizzi reported the description of the sexual state of Microspore gypsum. In 1927, Nannizzi reported the description of the sexual state of Microsporum gypseum the taxonomy of yeast fungi was described by Lodder and Kregervan Rij in 1952. The current classification of dermatophytes was published by Emmons in 1934 Finally, Gentles\u0027 successful treatment of tinea capitis with griseofulvin by in 1958 saved many patients with tinea capitis from permanent hair loss a common side effect after treatment with thallium importance of fungi Fungi inhabit almost every niche in the environment and humans are exposed to these organisms in various fields of life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003EHarmful Effects of Fung\u003C/strong\u003Ei: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

In this master course, we\u0027ll delve into the fundamental concepts of machine learning at a 101 level. Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that empowers computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without explicit programming. Understanding these basics will lay the groundwork for your journey into the vast and ever-evolving field of machine learning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMachine learning is a branch of AI that focuses on creating algorithms and models that can learn from data. Instead of being explicitly programmed to perform specific tasks, machine learning models can identify patterns and relationships in the data and make decisions or predictions based on those patterns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMachine learning has the potential to revolutionize various industries and improve decision-making processes. In this master course, we\u0027ve covered the fundamentals of machine learning at a 101 level, introducing you to key concepts like supervised and unsupervised learning, the machine learning process, and evaluation metrics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETypes of Machine Learning\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are three main types of machine learning:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea) Supervised Learning: In this type, the algorithm learns from labeled data, meaning it\u0027s provided with input-output pairs during the training phase. The goal is for the model to learn a mapping function that can predict the output for unseen inputs accurately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eb) Unsupervised Learning: Unlike supervised learning, unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data. The algorithm\u0027s objective is to find patterns and structures in the data without explicit guidance. Clustering and dimensionality reduction are typical tasks in unsupervised learning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ec) Reinforcement Learning: This type of learning is inspired by behavioral psychology, where an agent interacts with an environment and learns to take actions that maximize rewards or minimize penalties. The agent explores the environment and learns from the feedback it receives.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Machine Learning Process\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe typical machine learning process involves several key steps:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea) Data Collection: Obtaining relevant and high-quality data is crucial for successful machine learning models. The data should be representative of the problem you want to solve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eb) Data Preprocessing: This step involves cleaning the data, handling missing values, and transforming the data into a suitable format for training the models.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ec) Feature Engineering: Selecting and creating relevant features from the data is an essential part of building effective machine learning models. Good features can significantly impact the model\u0027s performance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ed) Model Selection: Choosing an appropriate algorithm or model architecture for the task at hand is essential. The choice of model depends on the problem type (classification, regression, etc.) and the nature of the data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ee) Model Training: In this step, the model is exposed to the training data to learn the underlying patterns and relationships. The algorithm adjusts its parameters to minimize the prediction errors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ef) Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model\u0027s performance on a separate set of data (validation or test set) is essential to ensure it generalizes well to unseen data and avoids overfitting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eg) Model Deployment: After a successful evaluation, the model can be deployed in a real-world setting to make predictions or decisions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEvaluation Metrics\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo assess the performance of a machine learning model, various evaluation metrics are used, depending on the type of problem. For classification tasks, metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are commonly used. For regression tasks, mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) are popular metrics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you continue your journey into the world of machine learning, remember that practice is crucial. Experiment with different datasets, algorithms, and model architectures to gain hands-on experience.

Viruses are classed into 7 types of genes, each of which has its own families of viruses, which in turn have differing replication strategies themselves David Baltimore, a Nobel Prize-winning biologist, devised a system called the Baltimore Classification System to classify different viruses based on their unique replication strategy. There are seven different replication strategies based on this system (Baltimore Class I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII). The seven classes of \u003Cstrong\u003EClass 1: Double-stranded DNA viruses \u003C/strong\u003EThis type of virus usually must enter the host nucleus before it is able to replicate. Some of these viruses require host cell polymerases to replicate their genome, while others, such as adenoviruses or herpes viruses, encode their own replication factors. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eclass 2: Single-stranded DNA viruses\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EViruses that fall under this category include ones that are not as well-studied, but still do pertain highly to vertebrates. Two examples include the Circoviridae\u0026nbsp; and Parvoviridae. They replicate within the nucleus, and form a double-stranded DNA intermediate during replication\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003EClass 3: Double-stranded RNA viruses\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E. This class includes two major families, the Reoviridae and Birnaviridae. Replication is monocistronic and includes individual, segmented genomes, meaning that each of the genes codes for only one protein, unlike other viruses, which exhibit more complex translation \u003Cstrong\u003EClass\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E 4: Single-stranded RNA viruses - positive-sense\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe positive-sense RNA viruses and indeed all genes defined as \u003Cstrong\u003Epositive-sense\u003C/strong\u003E can be directly accessed by host ribosomes to immediately form proteins. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecan be divided into two groups, both of which replicate in the cytoplasm:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u2022Viruses with polycistronic mRNA where the genome RNA forms the mRNA and is translated into a polyprotein product that is subsequently cleaved to form the mature proteins. This means that the gene can utilize a few methods in which to produce proteins from the same strand of RNA, reducing the size of its genome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u2022Viruses with complex transcription,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u2022 for which sub genomic mRNAs,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u2022 ribosomal frameshifting and proteolytic processing of polyproteins may be used.

One defining feature is the use of reverse transcriptase to convert the positive-sense RNA into DNA. Instead of using the RNA for templates of proteins, they use DNA to create the templates, which is spliced into the host genome using integrase.

These players can be divided roughly into two groups: those that are members of the innate immune system team and those that are part of the adaptive immune system. Importantly, these two groups work together to provide a powerful defense against invaders. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImmunology is a difficult subject for several reasons. First, there are lots of details, and sometimes these details get in \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe way of understanding the concepts. To get around this problem, we\u2019re going to concentrate on the big picture. It \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewill be easy for you to find the details somewhere else. Another difficulty in learning immunology is that there \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eis an exception to every rule. Immunologists love these exceptions, because they give clues as to how the immune \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esystem functions. But for now, we\u2019re just going to learn the rules. Oh sure, we\u2019ll come upon exceptions from time \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eto time, but we won\u2019t dwell on them. Our goal is to exam-ine the immune system, stripped to its essence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA third difficulty in studying immunology is that our knowledge of the immune system is still evolving. As \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyou\u2019ll see, there are many unanswered questions, and some of the things that seem true today will be proven \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efalse tomorrow. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe term \u201Cimmunology\u003C/strong\u003E\u201D is derived from Latin word \u201Cimmunis\u201D means exempt, i.e., protection from infectious diseases. Extensive work on bacteriology and pathology made their respective workers to find methods to develop resistance against infectious diseases in the latter half of 19th and beginning of 20th century. Although the history of immunology is about 100 years old, cellular immunology dates back to the 1950s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ewhy is immunology so important?\u003C/strong\u003E The immune system has involvement in almost all fields related to health and disease. Infections continue to confront human health and well-being on a global scale. Inflammation contributes to the \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Elung, heart and joint diseases, and diabetes mellitus; cancers have to evade immune surveillance, and immune dysregulation leads to allergies that are increasingly prevalent across the world. Only improved understanding of the \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emechanisms by which microbes, allergens, and tumor cells cause disease will result in the development of diagnostic, therapeutic, and preventative strategies to combat this threat.However, we are only beginning the voyage of immunology, and there is much we still need to research and understand. The study of basic immunology may provide students with an opportunity to relate the findings of fundamental sciscientific investigations to clinical problems\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ehistory\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBabylonian Epic of Gilgamesh (2000 B. C.) records the presence of pestilence and diseases. The study of Immunology stemmed out from the Thucydides\u2019 description of individuals who recovered from the plague in Athens. Those individuals, who had already contracted the disease, recovered and became \u201Cimmune.\u201D Variolation was practiced for many years in China. The process involved exposing healthy people to the material derived from the lesions caused by the disease by either putting it under the skin or, more often, inserting powdered scabs from smallpox pustules into the nose. However, that occasionally resulted in death because there was no standardization of the inoculum. Variolation, later, became popular \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ein England, mainly due to the efforts of Lady Mary Wortley Montague and the American colonies. In 1796, Jenner inoculated James Phipps with the material obtained from a cowpox lesion, which appeared on the hand of a \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edairymaid, and he inoculated the experimental subject with smallpox about six weeks later, without producing disease [1]. In 1875, Robert Koch was able to show the presence of anthrax causing bacteria in the lymph nodes of a dead rabbit that was earlier inoculated with the blood of a diseased animal [2]. In a serendipitous discovery, Pasteur was able to attenuate the virulent chicken cholera bacillus and coined the term vaccination. Later, he developed first viable vaccine for anthrax and rabies while Robert Koch studied hypersensitivity in tuberculosis. Although many consider Louis Pasteur the \u201Cfather of \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eimmunology,\u201D it is due to his and Koch\u2019s efforts that firmly established the historical germ theory of disease. Then, various scientists contributed to the development of the concept of cellular and humoral immunity. While working on the development of digestive organ in starfish larvae, Metchnikoff became a leading proponent of the \u201CCellularists.\u201D He believed that phagocytes, not antibodies, played the leading role in immunity. Emil von Behring and Kitasato demonstrated the transfer of immunity against Diphtheria by a soluble \u201Canti-toxin\u201D in the blood\u0026nbsp; whereby, Paul Ehrlich predicted the existence of immune bodies (antibodies) and side-chains from which they arise (receptors). Ehrlich suggested that antigens interact with receptors borne by cells, resulting in the secretion of excess receptors (antibodies).the supporters of alternative theory, i.e., \u201CHumoralists,\u201D believed that a soluble substance in the body was responsible for mediating immunity \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E OVERVIEW OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPHYSICAL BARRIERS\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eimmunological mechanisms\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETHE INNATE IMMUNE SYSTEM\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETHE ADAPTIVE IMMUNE SYSTEM\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eorgan of immune system\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecells of immune system\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAntigen\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMacrophage\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhat is immune response ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eimmunoglobulin\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eimmunotolerance\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehistocompatibility\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eimmunotherapy\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecytokines\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecomplement system\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegulation of immune response\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eimmunity to infection\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etransplantation immunology\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eautoimmune diseases\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehypersensitivity \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eimmunization\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etumor immunology\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eimmunodiagnostics\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/immunology-step-by-step/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5080764_72e0_2.jpg","duration":"6 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"5,207.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Students who are considering or attending medical school or other health-related professional programs (nursing, pharmacy, PA) \u2013 including those at the high school, undergraduate, and postgraduate levels Professionals looking to improve knowledge for work on health care applications, projects, and research Curious learners with sufficient prerequisites (biology, chemistry, physics) who want to know more"],"tags":["Immunology"],"rating":{"count":27,"averageValue":"4.8"},"instructors":[{"name":"Mohamed AL ashram","url":"/user/mohamed-taha-288/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.7083335}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"AF8C824F7B466BEE6B4E","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-iso-31000-risk-management-standard-course/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5579582,"title":"The Complete ISO 31000 Risk Management Standard Course","shortDescription":"Mastering ISO 31000: Principles, Assessment, Implementation, Best Practices","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to \u0022The Complete ISO 31000 Risk Management Standard Course\u0022!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre you ready to take your risk management skills to the next level?
