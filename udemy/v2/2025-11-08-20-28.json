Being the first to enter in 2005, Puppet is at the forefront of the IaaC revolutions and was the first tool amongst the four main configuration management tools including Chef, Ansible and Saltstack . Puppet is also the fastest configuration management system and provides a simple DSL (Domain Specific Language) to define the state of resources and does the heavy lifting of managing underlying platform specific operations by itself, providing users higher level of abstraction than scripts do.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe use of puppet is no more limited to servers, but has also expanded to managing all type of devices including routers, embedded systems, storage etc. With more and more organisations adopting to devops practices, knowledge on IaaC and tools such as Puppet is essential for today\u0027s generation of devops professionals.
