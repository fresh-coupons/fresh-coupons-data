Continuous Improvement has been rolled out in organisations for years, but often this has been done badly.\u0026nbsp;There is a right way to roll out CI, and that is explored in this course. I want you to leave this course with full confidence to deploy continuous improvement to deliver tools, projects and full mindset change across your organization. To do this, we will cover:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- What is CI (its purpose, benefits and key methodologies)?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- What are the main indicators that a CI\u0026nbsp;Initiative is needed? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- What are the main tools to deploy when building out a CI\u0026nbsp;Initiative?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Exploring the importance of teams, communication and the toolkit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Introducing key methodologies and concepts such as Lean \u0026amp;\u0026nbsp;Six Sigma.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Understanding how to deliver CI in the right way, an effective way that will garner the highest impact.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EContinuous Improvement has the power to deliver big savings, big reductions in waste and improvements to quality, customer and employee satisfaction. Deliver the CI mind set right, and the rest will do the work for you. And focus on that phrase mind set! As much as CI is made up of a process, a toolkit and several methodologies (such as Lean Six Sigma) it will only be truly successful if the mindset of those embarking on CI\u0026nbsp;is right.\u0026nbsp; By taking this course and delivering on the learnings, you will see the power of CI for you, your fellow colleagues and the wider organisation. \u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/continuous-improvement-an-introduction/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/3764678_7237_5.jpg","duration":"8.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"7,282.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Anyone currently working for a company who wants to improve the business","Anyone who owns a business / manages a department and wants to improve operational performance","Anyone who wants to upskill in this field as improving your business from within is a skill HIGHLY in demand","Anyone who wants to leave the course with full confidence of how to continually improve their business"],"tags":["Kaizen"],"rating":{"count":140,"averageValue":"4.7"},"instructors":[{"name":"Robert Chapman","url":"/user/robert-chapman-23/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.5454545}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"SEPTEMBERSELLERS","originalPrice":"\u20B92,499","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"1 day","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/direct-indirect-speech/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4393084,"title":"Direct Indirect Speech","shortDescription":"Direct Indirect Speech","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EIn this course, we will learn the following :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.
