With this course, you are going to add value to your existing JAVA and Vaadin 23\u002B (with SpringBoot) knowledge by getting familiar with several techniques for solving specifically selected areas of JAVA application development.

This is a comprehensive project based course where you will learn step by step on how to perform complex analysis and visualisation on real estate market data. This course will be mainly concentrating on forecasting the future housing market using two different forecasting models, those are linear regression and LSTM which stands for long short term memory. Regarding programming language, we are going to use Python alongside several libraries like Pandas for performing data modelling, Numpy for performing complex calculations, Matplotlib for visualising the data, and Scikit-learn for implementing the linear regression model and various evaluation metrics. Whereas, for the data, we are going to download the real estate market dataset from Kaggle. In the introduction session, you will learn basic fundamentals of real estate market forecasting, such as getting to know the characteristics of the real estate market, forecasting models that will be used, and major problems in the real estate market nowadays like limited housing supply and population growth. Then, continue by learning the basic mathematics behind linear regression where you will be guided step by step on how to analyze case study and perform basic linear regression calculation. This session was designed to prepare your knowledge and understanding about linear regression before implementing this concept to your code. Afterward, you will learn several different factors that can potentially impact the real estate market, such as population growth, government policies, and infrastructure development. Once you\u2019ve learnt all necessary knowledge about the real estate market, we will start the forecasting project. Firstly, you will be guided step by step on how to set up Google Colab IDE, then, you will also learn how to find and download datasets from Kaggle. Once everything is all set, you will enter the main section of the course which is the project section. The project will consist of two main parts, the first one is forecasting the real estate market trend using linear regression while the second one is forecasting the real estate market trend using a long short term memory model. Lastly, at the end of the course, you will learn how to evaluate the accuracy and performance of your forecasting models using R-squared and directional symmetry methods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, before getting into the course, we need to ask ourselves these questions: why should we learn to forecast the real estate market? What\u2019s the benefit? Well, I have a ton of answers to those questions. Firstly, the real estate market has always been considered a strong investment option due to its potential for long-term appreciation and income generation. Property values tend to appreciate over time, offering the opportunity for capital gains, while rental income from properties can provide a steady cash flow. Meanwhile, as big data technology has advanced very rapidly in the past few years, integrating this technology to forecast future market trends and prices by identifying patterns in the historical data can be very beneficial as it allows investors to make a data driven investment decision.

I started out my sales career in car sales. I loved it except I was only there to gain sales experience and I had to always be there to make a sale. I treated my car sales job as my college years. I was there 3 years, 10 months before I discovered brokering money. I sell other people\u2019s money to small business owners. I sell the sexiest product in the world. The one thing that 90% of the world is chasing, I am selling. It\u2019s perfect and you can do it from anywhere in the world. This isn\u2019t a get rich quick scheme so if you are looking for one, you\u2019ve picked up the wrong course. You will have to work, but you can easily make 7-6 figures doing this. I am going to help you avoid some of my mistakes and get to where you want to be quicker. Like I said in the beginning, I was a car salesman. I got burned out and had a young daughter and I have always known that I just wanted to learn how to sell then do my own thing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHow do you Broker Money? \u003C/strong\u003EBasically, You are an Independent sales Organization or ISO for short. Your job is to find small business owners who need money for their business, the business can be a start-up, the business can be in different industries. I would advise you to pick a niche. (More on that later) Once you find people who are in need of money you then connect them to our friends (direct lenders) who have money for sale. You make money in the middle. Your don\u2019t have to put up any of your own money to fund businesses. There\u2019s limited risk to you. Our job is to simply find people who need money for business purposes. As long as you can help people solve their money problems, you will never have money problems of your own. You can make money as soon as the Day after you get started. In this industry we can get businesses funding within 24 hours and we get paid from the direct lenders after the business is funded. In this course, you will learn how to find deals, how to sell and have the opportunity to work with me directly. \u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/business-loan-broker-product-knowledge-sales-marketing/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5462204_f50f.jpg","duration":"2 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"3,059.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["This course is for people who are looking for a career change or an opportunity to work for themselves from home.","Real estate professionals and Mortgage lenders do well in our industry","This course is great for people who are in car sales and are trying to get into a new industry","This course is for business bankers that want to work for themselves and provide loans for businesses"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":13,"averageValue":"4.5"},"instructors":[{"name":"Amir Towns","url":"/user/amir-towns-2/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.5384617}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"FC23348360C0C429FDDB","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"1 day","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/csharp-test-automation-engineer-from-zero-to-hero/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4531142,"title":"C# Test Automation Engineer - from Zero to Hero","shortDescription":"3 coureses in 1!

step by step in building a strong mentality towards the field of programming and gradually building methods for writing code in the C language in an effective way. In the lecture, we explain the basic theoretical details, in addition to having a practical application for them, then proceed with a practical application session that teaches you ways of thinking and how to apply what you have learned in what is called logical thinking, and apply it in code simply on the code editor, with all the explanation files, codes, and files for the session deliverables.
