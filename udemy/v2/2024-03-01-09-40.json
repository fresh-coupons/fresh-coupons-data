Afterwards we will go straight into the subject matter, namely the different types of workshop. I will show you an excerpt, which, in my experience, are the most common.

In addition, you will learn the basic building blocks of participatory participation. In this context, I will show you different ways of working together and also discuss the advantages and disadvantages. Often you will integrate all variants in one workshop, so that you get a wide range of variety and interpretation in your workshop.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWorkshop Design\u003C/strong\u003E: This chapter is intended to give you a rough overview of how to design workshops. We start with a rough overview and go into detail. With this basis, you can then fully design the order clarification, which we will discuss afterwards. This also includes a clear and well-formulated definition of objectives, because only if you know when a workshop is successful you can be successful. Accordingly, we will also look at some sample formulations in the course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EExamples of interventions:\u003C/strong\u003E In this chapter I will show you the best and fastest interventions to be implemented in workshops. Most of them come from systemic coaching, which I have adapted for the workshop concept. Basically a simple and subtle approach, but where we always focus on output and information gathering, so that we generate real added value. So you should be sufficiently prepared for your first workshop.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETeam development:\u003C/strong\u003E In this chapter we first discuss what makes good teams. In return, we will also take a critical look at teams. We will then look at the different occasions for team coaching so that you can implement the different approaches in your workshop architecture. An essential core element of this chapter are the development phases in teams. You will also become familiar with the concept of team roles. This will provide you with two comprehensive methods to help you diagnose and implement them. We will then devote ourselves to an extensive case study - a practical example from my experience. Together with you, I will go through the most important steps in the conceptual design from the initial situation to the implementation and tell you about my thoughts and ideas for implementation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EConflicts in teams\u003C/strong\u003E: Sooner or later you will be confronted with conflicts in your work as a manager/moderator/consultant. Whether in a small circle during a workshop or as a conflict workshop. In this short video series I will go into the definition, because meaning and types of conflicts. The causes of conflicts will help you to sharpen your understanding of the diagnosis of conflicts and to start appropriate interventions. Furthermore, the systemic view on conflicts helps you to follow and try out a solution- and resource-oriented approach. We will round off this chapter with the escalation steps and at the end I will briefly discuss how to deal with conflicts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith this online course you get recommendations for your own workshop design which you can implement for your own company.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecure your knowledge advantage now and enroll in this course right now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI look forward to seeing you in the course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest regards\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMarkus Edenhauser, MA MSc\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/workshops-systemic-conception-and-design/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/3330706_bbd6_3.jpg","duration":"5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"2,224.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["People who conceive and/or hold lectures and workshops."],"tags":["Train the Trainer"],"rating":{"count":10,"averageValue":"4.9"},"instructors":[{"name":"Markus Edenhauser","url":"/user/markus-edenhauser/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.9}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"FEB-DEAL3","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"3 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/coaching-und-beratung-treffen-auf-ki/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5696138,"title":"Coaching und Beratung treffen auf KI","shortDescription":"Der systemische Ansatz in Zeiten von ChatGPT","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003ETauche ein in die spannende Welt von \u0022\u003Cstrong\u003ECoaching und Beratung\u003C/strong\u003E treffen auf KI: Der\u003Cstrong\u003E systemische Ansatz\u003C/strong\u003E in Zeiten von \u003Cstrong\u003EChatGPT\u003C/strong\u003E.\u0022 In diesem innovativen Online-Kurs lernst ich, wie ich K\u00FCnstliche Intelligenz (KI) als m\u00E4chtiges Werkzeug in meine Coaching- und Beratungspraxis integrieren kann.

Management of innovations refers to the strategic planning, implementation, and oversight of processes and practices aimed at fostering innovation within an organization. It involves the systematic handling of new ideas, technologies, products, or processes from conception to implementation, with the goal of driving growth, competitiveness, and long-term success.  Key components of managing innovations include:  Strategic Planning: Effective management of innovations begins with strategic planning that aligns innovation efforts with the overall goals and objectives of the organization. This involves identifying areas for innovation, setting clear objectives, and allocating resources strategically.  Idea Generation and Screening: The management of innovations involves generating ideas for new products, services, or processes through brainstorming sessions, market research, or collaboration with stakeholders. These ideas are then screened and evaluated based on criteria such as feasibility, market potential, and alignment with organizational goals.  Resource Allocation: Allocating resources, including financial, human, and technological resources, is a critical aspect of managing innovations. This involves making decisions about how to allocate resources effectively to support innovation initiatives while balancing competing priorities.  Risk Management: Innovation inherently involves risks, including financial risks, technical risks, and market risks. Effective management of innovations requires identifying and assessing these risks and implementing strategies to mitigate them. This may involve conducting risk assessments, scenario planning, or developing contingency plans.  Cross-functional Collaboration: Managing innovations often requires collaboration across different departments or functional areas within an organization. Cross-functional teams bring together diverse perspectives and expertise to tackle complex innovation challenges and drive implementation.","Prototyping and Testing: Before bringing a new product or service to market, it\u0027s essential to prototype and test ideas to gather feedback and identify potential issues. The management of innovations involves overseeing the prototyping and testing process and using insights gained to refine and improve the innovation.  Intellectual Property Management: Protecting intellectual property is crucial for organizations investing in innovation. This involves managing patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets to ensure that the organization can capitalize on its innovations and maintain a competitive advantage.  Continuous Improvement: Innovation is an ongoing process that requires continuous learning and improvement. Effective management of innovations involves establishing mechanisms for gathering feedback, evaluating performance, and incorporating lessons learned to enhance future innovation efforts.  Overall, the management of innovations is about creating a supportive environment that fosters creativity, experimentation, and collaboration while also providing the structure and guidance needed to translate innovative ideas into tangible outcomes that drive organizational success.","Corporate entrepreneurship, also known as intrapreneurship, refers to the process of developing and implementing new ideas and innovations within an established organization. It involves fostering an entrepreneurial mindset and culture within the company to encourage employees to think creatively, take risks, and pursue opportunities for growth and innovation.  The main goal of corporate entrepreneurship is to drive organizational growth and competitiveness by leveraging internal resources and capabilities to develop new products, services, processes, or business models. By encouraging employees to think and act like entrepreneurs, companies can stay ahead of the curve, adapt to changing market conditions, and capitalize on emerging opportunities.  Learning about corporate entrepreneurship is important for companies and managers for several reasons:  Innovation and Adaptability: Companies need to continuously innovate and adapt to stay relevant. By fostering a culture of entrepreneurship, organizations can tap into the creative potential of their employees to generate new ideas and solutions.  Competitive Advantage: Corporate entrepreneurship can provide a significant competitive advantage by enabling companies to identify and capitalize on emerging market trends and opportunities before their competitors. It allows organizations to differentiate themselves in the market and create unique value propositions for their customers.  Employee Engagement and Retention: Employees are more likely to be engaged and motivated when they feel empowered to contribute their ideas and make a meaningful impact on the organization. By promoting entrepreneurship, companies can attract and retain top talent who are eager to take on new challenges and drive innovation.  Risk Management: Corporate entrepreneurship can help companies manage risk by encouraging experimentation and learning from failure in a controlled environment. By embracing a culture of innovation, organizations can identify potential risks and opportunities early on and develop strategies to mitigate them effectively.","Learning about corporate entrepreneurship can also support career development for managers and employees in several ways:  Skill Development: By participating in corporate entrepreneurship initiatives, managers and employees can develop valuable skills such as creativity, problem-solving, and strategic thinking. These skills are highly sought after in today\u0027s competitive job market and can open up new career opportunities.  Visibility and Recognition: Successfully leading or participating in corporate entrepreneurship projects can increase visibility and recognition within the organization. Managers and employees who demonstrate entrepreneurial behavior are often seen as valuable assets and may be considered for promotions or other career advancement opportunities.  Networking and Collaboration: Corporate entrepreneurship often involves cross-functional collaboration and networking with colleagues from different parts of the organization. Engaging in these activities can help managers and employees build strong relationships and expand their professional networks, which can be beneficial for career growth and development.  Overall, learning about corporate entrepreneurship is essential for companies and managers looking to drive innovation, stay competitive, and create value in today\u0027s dynamic business environment.

Course for any who want to build a career at Web3 or improve their knowledge.","Web3 refers to the next generation of the internet, often referred to as the decentralized web. It is envisioned as a more transparent, secure, and user-centric version of the internet, enabled by blockchain technology and decentralized protocols. In Web3, users have more control over their data and digital identities, and intermediaries such as centralized platforms are minimized or eliminated. This decentralized architecture offers various benefits such as increased privacy, censorship resistance, and the ability to create trustless interactions through smart contracts.","NFT stands for Non-Fungible Token. NFTs are unique digital assets that represent ownership or proof of authenticity of a particular item or piece of content, typically stored on a blockchain. Unlike cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, which are fungible and can be exchanged on a one-to-one basis, NFTs are indivisible and cannot be exchanged on a like-for-like basis due to their unique attributes. NFTs have gained significant attention in recent years, especially in the realms of digital art, collectibles, gaming, and virtual real estate, as they provide a way to establish scarcity and ownership in the digital world.","Learning about Web3 and NFTs is important for companies and managers for several reasons:  Understanding Emerging Technologies: Web3 and NFTs represent significant shifts in how we interact with the internet and digital assets. By staying informed about these technologies, companies and managers can anticipate trends and adapt their strategies accordingly.  New Business Opportunities: Web3 and NFTs open up new avenues for innovation and revenue generation. Companies that embrace these technologies can explore novel business models, such as decentralized finance (DeFi), tokenized assets, and digital collectibles.  Enhanced Customer Engagement: NFTs enable unique and personalized experiences for customers, whether through digital art, exclusive content, or virtual goods. By leveraging NFTs, companies can deepen customer engagement and foster a sense of community around their brand.  Mitigating Risks: As blockchain technology becomes more prevalent, understanding its implications becomes crucial for risk management. Companies need to grasp the security and regulatory considerations associated with Web3 and NFTs to protect their assets and reputation.","Developing skills in Web3 and NFTs can support career advancement or the launch of a business in several ways:  Technical Proficiency: Learning blockchain development, smart contract programming, and NFT standards (such as ERC-721 or ERC-1155) can open up opportunities for technical roles in blockchain-focused companies or projects.  Entrepreneurial Ventures: Individuals with expertise in Web3 and NFTs can capitalize on the growing demand for blockchain-based solutions by starting their own businesses. This could involve creating NFT marketplaces, developing blockchain games, or providing consultancy services to companies exploring blockchain integration.  Strategic Leadership: Managers who understand the potential of Web3 and NFTs can drive innovation within their organizations and guide strategic decisions related to blockchain adoption. This may involve identifying use cases, forming partnerships with blockchain startups, or implementing pilot projects to test new ideas.  Personal Branding: Building a reputation as a thought leader or expert in Web3 and NFTs can enhance career prospects and attract opportunities for speaking engagements, advisory roles, or partnerships.","In conclusion, learning about Web3 and NFTs is essential for companies and managers to stay competitive in a rapidly evolving digital landscape.

A successful manager is now expected to act as a leader, a mentor, and a coach, guiding their team members towards individual and collective success. This paradigm shift highlights the significance of coaching techniques in the realm of managerial responsibilities.","The Transformation of Managerial Roles  Evolving Leadership Expectations  The traditional image of a manager as a stern authority figure has given way to a more holistic view of leadership. Managers are now expected to serve as role models, motivators, and mentors to their teams. This shift stems from the recognition that employees perform at their best when they feel valued, supported, and empowered.  The evolution of leadership expectations can be traced back to the changing dynamics of the modern workplace. In the past, managers were primarily responsible for enforcing rules and ensuring productivity. However, as organizations began to realize that employee engagement and satisfaction were crucial for success, a transformation in managerial roles ensued.  Today, managers are not just tasked with overseeing tasks and projects; they are expected to inspire and empower their teams. This shift is partly a response to the changing nature of work itself. In a knowledge-based economy, where creativity, innovation, and adaptability are paramount, traditional top-down management no longer suffices.","Coaching as a Leadership Skill  Coaching has emerged as a pivotal leadership skill that fosters personal and professional growth. We\u0027ll explore how coaching techniques, such as active listening, constructive feedback, and goal-setting, can empower managers to become effective leaders who inspire and guide their teams towards excellence.  Coaching is not a one-size-fits-all approach; it is a dynamic and personalized method of leadership. Effective coaches adapt their style to the needs and preferences of individual team members. They actively listen to understand the unique challenges and aspirations of each employee, fostering a sense of trust and rapport.  Moreover, coaching is not merely about providing solutions but guiding employees to discover answers themselves. This approach instills a sense of ownership and accountability in team members. It encourages them to take the initiative, think critically, and develop problem-solving skills\u2014a valuable asset in today\u0027s fast-paced, ever-changing business landscape.

In an era marked by rapid technological advancements and industry disruptions, employees recognize the importance of continuous learning and skill enhancement to remain relevant and competitive.  This heightened emphasis on career development places managers at the forefront of helping their team members chart their professional journeys. Coaching knowledge equips managers with the ability to provide guidance that is not only aligned with the organization\u0027s needs but also tailored to the aspirations of individual employees.  One of the key advantages of coaching in career development is its ability to facilitate self-awareness. Effective coaches help employees identify their strengths, weaknesses, interests, and values. Armed with this self-knowledge, employees can make informed career decisions that align with their passions and long-term goals.","The Manager as a Career Development Partner  Explore the responsibilities of middle and top managers in preparing and mentoring personal development plans for their team members.

They play a pivotal role in creating personalized development plans that leverage individual strengths and address areas needing improvement.  These development plans not only benefit the employees but also the organization. By aligning individual development goals with the company\u0027s strategic objectives, managers ensure that every team member\u0027s growth contributes to the overall success of the business.
