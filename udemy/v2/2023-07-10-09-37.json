It assumes that you\u0027re new to the language, so it gets you started with basic functionality such as creating functions, creating variables, and calling these lines of code from your standard HTML pages. It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E*\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E javascript course contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript introduction\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript array\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript variables\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript functions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript objects\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript control statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript cookies\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript loop statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript data structures\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript error handling\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript regular expressions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003Esection 2- learn PHP\u0026nbsp;programming language\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis section will learn the basic structure of a web application and how a web browser interacts with a web server.

We are going to also create an authentication system which is a crucial part in building any modern web app nowadays. After this, we are going to dive deeper into the project by building the inside pages. So, we will display the Properties in various forms and ways based on price and type, and so on. And then we will move on to a different part and which is building the details page for every property and this will contain a lot of functionality. On this page, we are going to allow the user to add properties to favorites and send a request to the agent to meet up and talk about the property, these two features especially require great validation that we are going to implement. Something else that we are going to build is an admin panel and in it, we will handle a couple of things like creating admins and processing properties creating them and deleting them and we will show requests for every agent and so on.

It is a skill that can be learned and practiced, and it is one of the most important skills to develop for any organization or group of people. The following is a discussion of the concept, process, theory, and application of leadership.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe concept of leadership is based on the idea that people follow the direction of a leader to achieve a goal. A leader is someone who is respected and trusted by other people, and they have the ability to influence their decisions. Leaders must be able to motivate, inspire, and direct others in order to reach a successful outcome. Leadership also involves decision making, problem solving, and communication.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Process of Leadership\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe process of leadership involves setting goals, creating strategies for achieving those goals, and building the necessary team for execution. Leaders must also have the ability to delegate tasks, provide feedback and guidance, and ensure that everyone involved is working towards the same goal. This process can be refined over time with feedback from team members and revisions to strategies as needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Theories of Leadership\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETheory is an important part of leadership as well, as it helps to provide an understanding of why certain approaches work better than others. A leader must be familiar with different theories on motivation, communication, decision-making, problem-solving, and team dynamics in order to effectively lead their team. These theories will help them understand how to motivate their team, communicate with clarity, make sound decisions, solve problems efficiently, and manage a team effectively.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Application of Leadership\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, leadership application refers to how these concepts are put into practice. A leader must demonstrate their skills on a daily basis in order to be successful. This involves setting clear goals and expectations for their team, providing feedback and guidance when needed, and ensuring that everyone is working towards the same goal. It also means being able to adjust strategies when needed in order to achieve success.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn conclusion, leadership is an important concept that can be applied to any situation. It involves setting goals, creating strategies for achieving those goals, and building the necessary team for execution. Leaders must also understand theory in order to make informed decisions and apply their leadership skills on a daily basis. Leadership is not something that can be learned overnight but with practice and dedication it can be mastered over time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELeadership Concept, Process, Theories and Application\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDescription:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis course will introduce you to the fundamental concepts of leadership, the various leadership theories, and how to apply these theories to manage teams effectively.

Even if you\u2019re just looking to build profile, you need a strong internet presence, if you want people to know you exist. The purpose of Digital Marketing is to raise awareness, connect with people who are interested in what you\u2019re offering, and persuade them to take actions you want. It uses digital forms of communication, like the web, smartphones, social media platforms, and search engines, as a medium to reach potential customers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust like traditional marketing, digital marketing is about finding prospective customers and broadcasting your message to them in the right place, in the right tone, and at the right time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDigital Marketing has one major advantage over traditional marketing, as you can use analytics tools to monitor your campaigns in real time, so you can swiftly adjust your approach. Typically, it would cost more and take longer to make these kinds of adjustments, but with Digital Marketing it\u2019s easier to course correct than it would be if you\u2019d invested in a print ad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat is Social Media?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESocial Media is an umbrella term to describe online platforms focused on community-based communication, such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Platforms like this use content sharing and post interaction, and most content is produced from the users, not the owners of the platform. Social media also includes curation sites such as Wikis, as well as professional networking platforms like LinkedIn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDue to the massive reach of Social Media, good social media marketing skills are now \u003Cem\u003Eessential \u003C/em\u003Efor anyone looking to attract the maximum number of customers online.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat is SEO?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESEO, or Search engine optimization, is the science of attracting specific types of traffic to a website, using a search engine. To master SEO, you need to create high-value content with high authority backlinks, and include keywords in that content that your ideal customers search for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESEO is never a one size fits all solution. To be successful, you must take a bespoke approach. That means you need to optimise your site for the type of search engine you want it to rank highly on, like Google, Amazon, or Bing. SEO typically focuses on scoring highly organic search results, not paid or sponsored traffic. You can also use it in paid ads, to maximise their reach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs search engines attempt to give the most suitable answer to each person\u2019s search query, you must ensure a search engine views your site as the most appropriate match.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEvery search engine uses a different algorithm to determine what the best result to a search query is. This will include a combination of different factors, including the quality of your content and backlinks, how many visitors your site has, and your website\u2019s speed and uptime.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModern SEO is complex, and mastering it takes more than just getting the right meta tags. It includes understanding how rich snippets, video, and featured snippets work to enhance your rankings, as well as the importance of voice search and Video SEO. If you want to be successful using Google Search, you also need to understand how Google Rank Brain scores your website and must optimise your site to score highly on Google\u2019s algorithm.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat is Local SEO?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELocal SEO is also becoming more critical, and you will need to learn the basics of this, especially since nearly half of all Google searches now have a local intent. Near Me searches have grown even faster, exploding at a rate of 150% more than local searches alone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMastering SEO includes understanding Technical SEO, which focuses on priming your website for crawling and indexing by search engines. It\u2019s important you don\u2019t neglect this aspect, as without it search engines will find it difficult to access, crawl, and index your website. As a result, you\u2019ll rank much lower. The reason this process is referred to as \u201CTechnical SEO\u201D is because it has nothing to do with promoting your website, and is not the same as the type of SEO you include in your content.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat types of careers will this course help you with?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you complete this course, you\u2019ll be a Digital Marketing Master, and will have many different career options open to you.

Your options will be almost unlimited, as strong digital marketing skills are \u003Cem\u003Ehighly \u003C/em\u003Ein demand.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs they focus on online business, and can be done entirely online, Digital Marketing jobs are also pandemic proof, so your skillset will always be needed. Just make sure to narrow down your choices and focus on what you enjoy and do well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe you have a passion for branding, and would like to work as a branding consultant for start-up companies? Perhaps you\u2019re interested in specialising, whether that be in marketing for the tech sector, the health and wellness niche, or in real estate?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best way to achieve top earnings is to find a niche you can position yourself as an authority voice in, and you can do this by acquiring a skillset your competitors don\u2019t have. If you can offer expertise in Facebook advertising, or email marketing, for example, you will be bringing something extra to the table that will give you an edge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving niche knowledge will mark you out from other candidates trying to land their first gig and signal that you\u2019re a high value candidate to employers and clients.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also specialise by diversifying into niche careers such as SEO or copywriting. SEO knowledge is a highly in demand skill and it doesn\u2019t require a qualification. If you know how to do it right, copywriting can be similarly rewarding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause of the amount of online content we consume, demand for skilled SEO experts and pro copywriters has grown massively. More brands than ever require well-written content, that\u2019s optimised to perform well in search. If you can combine the two, you\u2019ll have a HUGE competitive advantage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you\u2019re getting started, you can try freelance sites, like Elance or People per Hour, although it will take a little while to build up a reputation. Blogging can be another area you can build up a following in and then monetize, though to do well you must post regularly, and provide unique content.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWebsite design skills, which you will learn on this course, are another great way to make money. You can gain practical experience by creating sites for your family and friends for free, or in exchange for their skills. Practical experience is essential when you\u2019re first starting out and will stand you in great stead as you progress in your mastery.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you become more confident and have built up your portfolio, you\u2019ll be able to land paid clients.
