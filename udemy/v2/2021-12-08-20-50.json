Unfortunately, the contemporary but dry conflict resolution and mediation techniques are insufficient to resolve complex and sensitive disagreements, especially when addressing delicate human interactions. After negotiating and mediating for over a decade, I realized that conflicts were manageable until people unknowingly complicated them even against their interests. In most cases, the underlying needs, fears, and wishes were undiscovered and miscommunicated to the other party. Therefore, I combined transactional analysis (TA), cognitive-behavioral psychology (CBT), and non-violent communication (NVC) techniques in my mediation and coaching efforts to comprehend the human mind and behavior accurately, its manifestation during disagreements, and facilitate mutually acceptable solutions even for the most complicated disputes.
