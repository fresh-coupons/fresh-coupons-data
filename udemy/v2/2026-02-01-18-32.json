help you master \u003Cstrong\u003ENatural Language Processing as an engineering discipline\u003C/strong\u003E, not just as a collection of prebuilt models. NLP sits at the core of modern AI systems, powering \u003Cstrong\u003Esearch engines\u003C/strong\u003E, \u003Cstrong\u003Erecommendation systems\u003C/strong\u003E, \u003Cstrong\u003Ecustomer intelligence platforms\u003C/strong\u003E, \u003Cstrong\u003Efraud detection\u003C/strong\u003E, \u003Cstrong\u003Edocument understanding\u003C/strong\u003E, and \u003Cstrong\u003Eenterprise AI applications\u003C/strong\u003E. While many modern courses focus only on \u003Cstrong\u003Elarge language models\u003C/strong\u003E and \u003Cstrong\u003Eprompt engineering\u003C/strong\u003E, this course fills a critical gap by teaching how \u003Cstrong\u003Ereal-world NLP systems are actually built, evaluated, and deployed\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis course takes you far beyond surface-level usage of APIs and pretrained models. You will learn how \u003Cstrong\u003Eraw text is transformed into structured signals\u003C/strong\u003E, how \u003Cstrong\u003Eclassical NLP techniques\u003C/strong\u003E still form the backbone of many production systems, and how \u003Cstrong\u003Emodern transformers and embeddings\u003C/strong\u003E are used for understanding tasks without relying on text generation. The goal is to help you think like an \u003Cstrong\u003EAI Engineer\u003C/strong\u003E who can design, debug, and optimize NLP systems from first principles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThroughout the course, you will develop a deep understanding of \u003Cstrong\u003Etext preprocessing\u003C/strong\u003E, \u003Cstrong\u003Etokenization strategies\u003C/strong\u003E, \u003Cstrong\u003Estemming and lemmatization\u003C/strong\u003E, \u003Cstrong\u003Esentence segmentation\u003C/strong\u003E, and \u003Cstrong\u003Elinguistic pipelines\u003C/strong\u003E that are essential for building robust NLP workflows. You will explore \u003Cstrong\u003Efeature engineering for classical NLP\u003C/strong\u003E, including \u003Cstrong\u003EBag-of-Words\u003C/strong\u003E, \u003Cstrong\u003En-grams\u003C/strong\u003E, \u003Cstrong\u003ETF-IDF\u003C/strong\u003E, and \u003Cstrong\u003Estatistical weighting\u003C/strong\u003E, gaining insight into why these methods are still widely used in production environments today. Rather than treating these techniques as outdated, the course shows how they complement modern deep learning systems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou will then move into \u003Cstrong\u003Eword representations and distributional semantics\u003C/strong\u003E, learning how meaning emerges through \u003Cstrong\u003Evector space geometry\u003C/strong\u003E. Concepts such as the \u003Cstrong\u003Edistributional hypothesis\u003C/strong\u003E, \u003Cstrong\u003Estatic word embeddings\u003C/strong\u003E, \u003Cstrong\u003Eembedding similarity\u003C/strong\u003E, \u003Cstrong\u003Evector arithmetic\u003C/strong\u003E, and \u003Cstrong\u003Esemantic drift\u003C/strong\u003E are explained clearly and intuitively. The course emphasizes not just how embeddings work, but how they fail, covering critical limitations such as \u003Cstrong\u003Epolysemy\u003C/strong\u003E, \u003Cstrong\u003Econtext blindness\u003C/strong\u003E, and \u003Cstrong\u003Evocabulary freeze\u003C/strong\u003E, which directly motivate the transition to contextual models.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs the course progresses, you will learn how NLP handled context before transformers through \u003Cstrong\u003Esequence modeling\u003C/strong\u003E, including \u003Cstrong\u003EMarkov assumptions\u003C/strong\u003E, \u003Cstrong\u003Erecurrent neural networks\u003C/strong\u003E, \u003Cstrong\u003ELSTMs\u003C/strong\u003E, \u003Cstrong\u003EGRUs\u003C/strong\u003E, and \u003Cstrong\u003Ebidirectional models\u003C/strong\u003E. These topics are presented not as historical artifacts, but as foundational ideas that still shape modern architectures and interview discussions. You will understand why \u003Cstrong\u003Etransformers replaced RNNs\u003C/strong\u003E, focusing on \u003Cstrong\u003Eparallelization\u003C/strong\u003E, \u003Cstrong\u003Elong-context modeling\u003C/strong\u003E, and \u003Cstrong\u003Etraining stability\u003C/strong\u003E, without unnecessary hype.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA major focus of the course is \u003Cstrong\u003Econtextual embeddings and representation learning\u003C/strong\u003E, where you will learn how \u003Cstrong\u003Eencoder-only models\u003C/strong\u003E are used for \u003Cstrong\u003Etext understanding\u003C/strong\u003E, \u003Cstrong\u003Eclassification\u003C/strong\u003E, and \u003Cstrong\u003Esemantic similarity\u003C/strong\u003E. You will explore \u003Cstrong\u003Esentence and document embeddings\u003C/strong\u003E, compare \u003Cstrong\u003ECLS token representations versus mean pooling\u003C/strong\u003E, and understand how these embeddings power \u003Cstrong\u003Esemantic search\u003C/strong\u003E, \u003Cstrong\u003Eclustering\u003C/strong\u003E, and \u003Cstrong\u003Eretrieval systems\u003C/strong\u003E used in real companies. The course also teaches how to properly evaluate embeddings using \u003Cstrong\u003Eintrinsic and extrinsic metrics\u003C/strong\u003E, while addressing \u003Cstrong\u003Ebias\u003C/strong\u003E, \u003Cstrong\u003Efairness\u003C/strong\u003E, and \u003Cstrong\u003Erepresentation risks\u003C/strong\u003E, ensuring you build systems that are both effective and responsible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis course is specifically designed to help you \u003Cstrong\u003Ebecome employable in the AI and NLP job market\u003C/strong\u003E.
