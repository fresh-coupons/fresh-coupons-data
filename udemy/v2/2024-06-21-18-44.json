It is a skill that requires physical habits. That is why you will be asked to take part in numerous exercises where you record yourself speaking on video, and then watching yourself. Learning presentation skills is like learning how to ride a bicycle. You simply have to do it numerous times and work past the wobbling and falling off parts until you get it right.\u0026nbsp; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp; \tThis course contains numerous video lectures plus several bonus books for your training library.\u0026nbsp; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp; \tTJ Walker has been coaching and training people on their presentation skills for 30 years. Now, through the power of Udemy\u0027s online platform, he is able to give you the same high quality training that he gives in person to CEOs, Fortune 500 executives, and Presidents of countries. Only you can now receive the training at a tiny fraction of the normal fee for in-person training.\u0026nbsp; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp; \tHow long this course takes is up to you. The longest part of the course involves you speaking on video, critiquing yourself, and doing it over until you like it. But if you get to the point where you love how you look and sound when you present it will be well worth the time spent. And having this skill will save you time for all future presentations in your life.\u0026nbsp; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp; \tYou can begin improving your persuasive presentation skills right now.
