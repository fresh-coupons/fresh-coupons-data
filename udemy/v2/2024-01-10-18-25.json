Zero trust architectures simplify network infrastructure, make users happier, and keep cyberthreats at a distance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince John Kindervag, then at Forrester Research, coined the phrase, zero trust architectures follow the maxim \u0022never trust, always verify.\u0022 To block inappropriate access and lateral movement throughout an environment, zero trust architecture enforces access policies based on context\u2014including the user\u0027s role and location, the device they\u0027re using, and the data they\u0027re asking for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA zero trust architecture means you know who\u0027s using what, and you can track it, including encrypted traffic; you need to monitor and verify the traffic between parts of the environment; and you need multifactor authentication (MFA) that goes beyond passwords.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn important thing to remember is that in a zero trust architecture, a resource\u0027s location isn\u0027t as important as before. Rather than rigid network segmentation, software-defined microsegmentation protects your data, workflows, services, and such anywhere, in your data center or distributed hybrid or multicloud.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy using a network-centric data security strategy that provides specific access only to those who need it, Zero Trust Architecture focuses on the business needs and functionality of an organization. By enabling parameters to dictate access and restrictions, the Zero Trust model views data security from a whole new perspective. As opposed to legacy networks that have little to no visibility or control over network and data usage, Zero Trust Architectures see all network traffic through segmentation gateways with granular policies governing access to data, apps, and assets.
