Linear regression is one of the easiest and most popular Machine Learning algorithms. It is a statistical method that is used for predictive analysis. Linear regression makes predictions for real or numeric variables such as sales, salary, age, product price, etc. A linear regression model describes the relationship between a dependent variable, y, and one or more independent variables, X. The dependent variable is also called the response variable. Independent variables are also called explanatory or predictor variables. Continuous predictor variables are also called covariates, and categorical predictor variables are also called factors.

It talks and explains the networking basics which is much more helpful for the beginners who are new to the world and domain of networking. This OSPF Certification course of Routing Protocol OSPF builds a strong foundation for them to prepare for good level certifications like CCNA. You will be able to learn all the terminologies and key functionalities related to routing protocols. There is n number of routing protocols that are developed today but only very few have been adopted by the industry. In this course, all those concepts will be explained in detail and you can practice them at your ease. The broad areas to be covered are related to configurations, operations, and troubleshooting. Apart from that, there are a few use cases of two very popular Routing protocols that work on the principle of OSPF and have their level of advantages. This OSPF Certification Module describes how to connect and configure and operate Open Shortest Path First which was specifically designed for IP networks and therefore supports IP tagging and sub-netting of extremely derived information related to routing. It also allows the packet-based information and authentication to take place and also makes use of the multicast for Internet protocol when either sending or receiving any packet\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis course module named Routing Protocols RIP and EIGRP is quite similar to the one used above and is also responsible to teach you many basics and fundamental concepts such as those related to troubleshooting, operation, and configuration. The two most important routing protocols which will be explained in detail are the RIP also known as Routing information protocol and the other is EIGRP which is the abbreviated form for Extended interior Gateway protocol. In the RIP protocol, the oldest of the vectors for distance IP Routing protocols are still put to use and thereby getting various enhancements. There are currently two versions that exist for the RIP viz. RIPv1 and RIPv2. RIPv1 is also said to be the classful protocol which means that it is not classless whereas if you talk about the RIPv2, it is considered to be the classless support routing protocol and IPv6 is the one whose support is extended to RIPv2 with the next-gen RIP which is also termed as RIPng. EIGRP, on the other hand, is related to the Interior Gateway protocol as it is a proprietary protocol of the company CISCO. This protocol is occasionally described as the distance vector routing protocol which also acts and imitates like a link state-oriented protocol. Distance vector-based protocols share everything of which they are aware of. The only limitation they carry is that the amount of information shared is only among the neighbors which are directly or indirectly connected with each other. Link state-based protocols announce that the information present is only about the direction and not indirectly connected links. However, they are also responsible to share the routing protocol information among themselves in all the areas they deem fit among all the routes in their domain or area.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/cisco-ospf-hands-on-certification-training/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4844382_3644_3.jpg","duration":"10.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"14,775.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["The target audience for this course is anybody who has a keen interest in the field of digital communication and is also aware of how the basics of understanding the networks and other routing protocols and mechanisms such as OSPF Routing.

This library is a powerful object-oriented interface to the Tk GUI toolkit. In this course, you would get to know more about organizing and fitting widgets into the layout, basic transformations, creation of drop-down menu, shapes \u0026amp; graphics, intricacies of building login applications, and many other advanced GUI techniques. This will take you through different types of GUI interfaces and help in a detailed explanation of building a button in a GUI. we would create a windows application wherein we would first learn to set up the mainframe and then build on to that for creating a guest list page and a check-in page. Finally creating page having guest by room numbers and their receipts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPython GUI is one of the various toolkits present with Python and this toolkit focusses on developing GUI (Graphical User Interface). Now since python GUI is very specific to Python, let us look at what GUI essentially means, and then we may be able to jump into understanding specifically Python GUI. GUI or in other words, Graphical User Interface is a form of a connection tool through which users would be able to interact with electronic devices. This interaction is through the use of buttons and graphical icons which makes it visually appealing for users to use and the software behind the icons removes the robotic coding required to perform the particular task. The intention of the introduction of GUI is thought to reduce the commands that need to be typed at the command-line interface (CLI) through keyboard and that exactly what task it does!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow coming to Python GUI, let us say, for example, we would need to run a code in python, a .py file through the command line. We would create a simple GUI which might have a button \u201CRun\u201D and once a user clicks on that the python file which intends to run will automatically get selected and will run. What Python GUI would do essentially is remove the unnecessary coding part of running the python file through CLI. Not only this there are other plausible features Python GUI provides and that\u2019s exactly what you would go through in this course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring the training and post completion of the training, one would imbibe skills to take on more daring challenges in professional life. This course will also allow you to grasp the business intelligence required to be that handful of developers in Python GUI. This training will also give you a glimpse of the security concerns one faces in the real-world and, also allow you to think about how we can take care of those concerns. This Python GUI Course will also help you in getting the frame of mind to design the visual components and understand the temporal behavior of building the GUI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you complete the course you would b able to appreciate the enhancement of efficiency through the use of GUI, and the ease of use of the logical design of the program underlying in the design. With the completion of the course you would be able to bring in modularity in any GUI application you would build along with enhancing the usability perspective of GUI. This training is not restricted to just the theoretical part, but we enhance the use of theoretical concepts in the playground of real-life projects giving you an upper hand in establishing the relation of the concept and using them in real life. We ensure that no stone will be left unturned to make you the best python GUI developer organizations are looking for.

I found this course created by TJ Walker a perfect introduction to the world of media training. I wanted to learn, not only what a media trainer does, but also what steps I would have to take in order to become a successful media trainer--TJ discusses all this in a clear and concise manner, in a tone that is welcoming and never alienating. The only constructive critique I would give would be concerning the technical form of the presentation, more specifically the video quality and picture aesthetic. Going by the current standard as it applies to video, everything we view is in high definition. Having said that, I believe the video quality could be improved upon as well as the backdrop which I found to be a bit generic and outdated. I found these minor flaws to be slightly distracting and given the high caliber of the speaker and the information being presented I believe these aspects detracted, if only marginally, from the quality of the product.\u0022\u0026nbsp;\u003C/em\u003ENick Cisik\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u00225 Stars!
