Designed to enable learners to grapple with the complexities of cost accounting in a simplified and structured manner, this course is perfect for anyone seeking to augment their understanding of managerial accounting processes, particularly those revolving around job cost systems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStarting with an introduction to managerial accounting topics, we delve into the nuanced realm of job cost systems and process cost systems. Recognizing that these two systems form the backbone of manufacturing cost accounting, we undertake a thorough comparative analysis to help you understand when and why a company would employ either of these systems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe place significant emphasis on the classification of costs, dissecting its importance, and demonstrating various methodologies to classify costs effectively. This understanding is fundamental, as it forms the basis of cost flow in the accounting process within manufacturing companies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDigging deeper into the job cost system, we traverse the intricate pathways of inventory cost flows. You\u0027ll gain insights into the movement of costs associated with raw materials, through work in process and factory overhead, before they culminate in finished goods and are eventually expensed as cost of goods sold.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to theoretical aspects, we explore practical elements of a job cost system by discussing key documents integral to recording cost flows. We tackle overhead costs, a vital yet often misunderstood aspect of job cost systems. By clarifying the concept of actual overhead and estimated overhead applied to jobs, you\u0027ll learn to calculate the predetermined overhead rate, a crucial tool for estimating overhead allocations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA significant portion of the course is dedicated to the practical application of knowledge acquired. We walk you through the recording of journal entries pertaining to costs at various stages of the job cost system. From transferring raw materials to work in process and factory overhead, to managing direct and indirect wages, to closing out finished jobs and recording the sale and costs of finished jobs - you\u0027ll be given hands-on exposure to real-world accounting scenarios.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith an emphasis on student interaction, this course also introduces discussion questions aimed at facilitating productive conversations between peers. These discussions offer the opportunity to approach the subject matter from multiple perspectives, enriching your overall learning experience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOur course comes bundled with valuable resources to reinforce your understanding. We provide downloadable PDF Files for offline reference and preformatted Excel Practice Files to bolster your Excel proficiency.

These medical practices are an integral part of Traditional Chinese Medicine and have a history of over 1000 years. While acupressure involves applying pressure to special points distributed across the body, acupuncture involves inserting needles at these points. Both acupressure and acupuncture are very beneficial as they help relieve a number of problems from headaches to stress to back aches to pregnancy related issues. Acupoints are points mapped out along these meridians; they are gateways for the entry and exit of energy in the body. Acupoints are also called xue and tsubo. There are almost 350 acupressure points across the body. When the flow of energy is blocked at any of these acupoints, it causes diseases, aches and pains. The ailments could affect any of the organs along the meridian. The imbalance can be corrected by simply applying pressure to acupoints. Applying pressure stimulates the acupoints and corrects the imbalance. Thus, it restores health.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E TCM has already evolved thousands of years!

However, unlike Logistic regression which generates only binary output, it is used to predict a discrete variable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPoisson Regression in SAS is a type of regression analysis model which is used for predictive analysis where there are multiple numbers of possible outcomes expected which are countable in numbers. SAS provides built-in functions to calculate and evaluate the Poisson regression model. Poisson regression is useful to predict the value of the response variable Y by using one or more explanatory variable X. This is a preferred probability distribution which is of discrete type. One of the use cases of a Poisson regression model would be predicting the number of leads that will convert to customers within a particular time frame in an organization.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn Probability and Statistics, there are three distributions based on continuous and discrete data \u2013 Normal, Binomial, and Poisson Distributions. \u003Cstrong\u003ENormal Distribution\u003C/strong\u003E is often seen as a Bell Curve. Poisson distribution is often referred to as the Distribution of rare events. This is predominantly used to predict the probability of events based on how often the event has happened. It allows for a given number of events occurring in a set of periods.

It identifies who has power and accountability, and who makes decisions. It is, in essence, a toolkit that enables management and the board to deal more effectively with the challenges of running a company. Corporate governance ensures that businesses have appropriate decision-making processes and controls in place so that the interests of all stakeholders (shareholders, employees, suppliers, customers and the community) are balanced. Good corporate governance can benefit investors and other stakeholders, while bad governance can lead to scandal and ruin. Governance refers to the set of rules, controls, policies, and resolutions put in place to direct corporate behavior. A board of directors is pivotal in governance, while proxy advisors and shareholders are important stakeholders who can affect governance. Communicating a company\u0027s corporate governance is a key component of community and investor relations. For instance, Apple Inc.\u0027s investor relations site profiles its corporate leadership (the executive team and board of directors) and provides information on its committee charters and governance documents, such as bylaws, stock ownership guidelines, and articles of incorporation. Most successful companies strive to have exemplary corporate governance. For many shareholders, it is not enough for a company to be profitable; it also must demonstrate good corporate citizenship through environmental awareness, ethical behavior, and other sound corporate governance practices.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/corporate-governance-us-and-uk-markets/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5621750_ba49.jpg","duration":"2.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"1,398.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Bankers, Accountants, Stakeholders of a company, Anyone who wants to learn about corporate governance"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":0,"averageValue":"0.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"EDUCBA Bridging the Gap","url":"/user/premananda-suna/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":0}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"EDUCBABF19","originalPrice":"\u20B91,999","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/predictive-analytics-modeling-using-spss/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5627135,"title":"Predictive Analytics \u0026 Modeling using SPSS","shortDescription":"Predictive Analytics \u0026 Modeling course aims to enhance predictive modelling skills across business sectors","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EPredictive modelling course aims to provide and enhance predictive modelling skills across business sectors/domains.

For example, if there is a rise in temperature it will also lead to a rise in the sales of ice creams. This is called positive correlation. Correlation analysis deals with relationship among variables. The correlation coefficient lets researchers to measure if there is a possible linear relationship between two variables measured on the same subject. The values of the correlation coefficient are always between -1 and \u002B1. There are different types of correlation coefficients used for different situation. The most common is the Pearson correlation coefficient. This chapter contains more details about the correlation theory and explains its types in detail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInterpretation of SAS Output\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe output produced by PROC CORR in SAS gives a lot of useful information. The output contains information regarding the list of variables included in the analysis. Next it provides a list of simple statistics for each variable in the analysis. This list contains the number of observations, mean, standard deviation, sum, minimum and maximum. One list contains each variable and their label. Finally the correlation measures are provided in the output. The output will be named \u201CPearson Correlation Coefficient\u201D by default.

The syntax looks like \u2018C\u2019 meaning it is statically typed so this provides more certainty on the types of values you are passing on, but it is also meant to be used in OOP, if you have a background in C you\u2019ll pick it up quick.

Powerful Java IDE\u2019s such as \u003Cstrong\u003EEclipse, NetBeans, IntelliJ IDEA, etc.\u003C/strong\u003E play a big role in the success of Java.\u003Cbr\u003EThese IDE\u2019s provide many facilities such as debugging, syntax highlighting, code completion, language support, automated refactoring, etc. that make coding in Java easier and faster.\u003Cbr\u003EJava has created a base for the Android operating system and opted around \u003Cstrong\u003E90% of fortune 500 companies\u003C/strong\u003E to developing a lot of back-end applications. Also, it plays a great role in Apache Hadoop data processing, Amazon Web Services, and Windows Azure, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E7. Java is Free of Cost:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOne of the reasons Java is very popular among individual programmers is that it is available under the Oracle Binary Code License (BCL) free of charge. This means that Java is free for development and test environments, but for commercial purposes, a small fee is required.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E8. Java is Platform Independent:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EJava is platform-independent as the Java source code is converted to byte code by the compiler which can then be executed on any platform using the Java Virtual Machine. Java is also known as a WORA (write once, run anywhere) language because it is platform-independent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the development of most Java applications occurs in a Windows environment while they are run on a UNIX platform because of the platform-independent nature of Java.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E9. Java has great Documentation Support:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe documentation support for Java is excellent using \u003Cstrong\u003EJavadoc\u003C/strong\u003E which is the documentation generator for Java. It uses the Java source code to generate the API documentation in HTML format. So, Javadoc provides a great reference while coding in Java so that understanding the code is quite simple.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E10. Java is Versatile:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EJava is very versatile as it is used for programming applications on the web, mobile, desktop, etc. using different platforms.
