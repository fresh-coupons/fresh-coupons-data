After analysis, we understand what will help students to learn Java in a more efficient way. In this course:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E- High concentration of useful material in each lesson\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESometimes you can notice that watching 5 minutes of our lesson is equivalent to watching other 30 minutes lessons. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is because time spent for preparation for the lesson (script for the lesson, lesson structure) and video editing (to cut boring pieces of the lesson or time when the program loads) sometimes \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E10 times as much (sometimes even 20)\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E as the final lesson duration after video editing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly your homework and coding exercises including the EXAM\u0026nbsp;task might take approximately 20 hours to implement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, each topic is separated from another. In case some concept will be explained in the next lesson and you don\u0027t need to worry about understanding this in the scope of this lesson - the instructor will make an announcement when a specific topic will be covered. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGo and try it yourself!\u0026nbsp;We will appreciate your feedback.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E- Relevant knowledge\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter our team investigated other Java courses on Udemy we realized that most of them have nothing in common with real life. The information which is shared there is very old and significantly out of date. For example, the instructor teaches a framework which is not been used already for 15 years. Or instructors do stress on the programming design which is not used anymore at all!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe instructor of this course is a consultant in a top-rated IT\u0026nbsp;outsourcing company and helps to bring cutting-edge solutions in IT for all his clients. Feel free to check the LinkedIn page of the instructor and check skills endorsement. More than 18 thousand people across all over the world (BTW\u0026nbsp;most of them are from the top 100 companies of the world) evaluated the skills of Andrii Piatakha. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith this course, you can be sure that you will spend your time learning the right things from one of the best IT\u0026nbsp;consultants in the world. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E- Sequence of lessons\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter the years of teaching offline, and based on the feedback of students who are passing online courses we realized how important the sequence of lessons is while teaching Java. The same issue is with the books where information is completely unstructured what makes things even more complex. For example, how students can learn object-oriented programming from the first lesson if they don\u0027t know yet the java syntax basics?\u0026nbsp;Or how a student can implement a home task if he/she doesn\u0027t aware of java methods specifics, or doesn\u0027t know yet how to read program input?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in this course, you can be sure, that you will not get a home task to implement without having enough information to implement it. The program which is in this course is proven by many students who completed it offline and now work as software engineers in outsourcing companies and as freelancers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E- Interview practice tests\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/strong\u003EBeing an IT consultant in different companies, the tutor of this course was in charge of driving the interview process in companies to make sure, that company selects the best people. That\u0027s why the first interview is always test. In case the test is completed, the candidate is invited to have a conversation. That\u0027s why in this course we want to prepare you to complete tests successfully! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEspecially for our students, we prepared tests that could be used to evaluate their knowledge during the interview process. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 tests. 90 questions each \u003Cstrong\u003E(180 interview tests in total). \u003C/strong\u003E120 minutes each.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can read explanations for answers!

Also, you have a lot of tasks that use domain-specific terminology:\u0026nbsp;accounts, transactions, users, carts, menu, services, etc. So that means you are learning programming without abstract concepts like it is written in the books or in other courses. You learn domain-specific terminology and during the lessons, we investigate specific extracts from code that can give you a clear vision of how you can apply the knowledge in real life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo don\u0027t wait!
