Digital cameras\u003Cstrong\u003E \u003C/strong\u003Eare built into doorbells; your smartphone tracks your daily movements from work to home and back; and you receive social media updates when you go to the gym, see a show, or visit a new city. Digital technology tracks your phone calls, bank transactions, and medical appointments. What about criminal or unethical behavior if it tracks your mundane daily activities?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat activity is also monitored, and as a\u003Cstrong\u003E \u003C/strong\u003Edigital forensic investigator, you\u0027ll need to understand where digital evidence is stored and how to analyse it. There is almost no criminal activity that does not involve digital evidence, and it is your responsibility as an investigator to gather all available evidence, process it, and present your findings to the authorities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInvestigators who work in the field of digital forensics must have a diverse set of skills and interests. The first question I ask anyone thinking about a career in this field is if they enjoy solving puzzles. You may not have access to any information other than the fact that something happened when investigating a case. So, if someone needs to be shown or told what happened, this field may not be right for them. When a case is brought to an investigator\u0027s attention, the investigator is often given instructions to figure out what the computer or device was used for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother important trait is the ability to deal with frustration, as investigative tools and software do not always work without problems. When it comes to cell phones and small devices, this is a fairly common occurrence. Many students, rather than working through the challenges, stop their investigation in class at the first sign of difficulty. They don\u0027t even try to figure out what\u0027s wrong with the tool by looking at the web or using the help system. To be a successful investigator, one must be persistent and creative \u2013 they must be problem solvers. Digital forensics is a branch of forensic science that collects, analyses, documents, and presents digital evidence related to computer crime for use in a court of law using scientific knowledge. Knowing what was done, when it was done, and who did it is the ultimate goal.

Being able to program in C\u002B\u002B is not different. This is why this course is here to help you learn everything you need to know about C\u002B\u002B and master this programming language. If you :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Want to create various projects with this programming language \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Are in school and need to understand certain notions and concepts in C\u002B\u002B\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Need to learn the basics of this programming language for work \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Are simply curious about this topic\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen you will definely love this course and it\u0027s content. Not only you will learn and understand all the basics of C\u002B\u002B programming but you will also have a lot of practice throughtout this course. Indeed, by the end of this course you will have a strong and solid understanding of all the basics of C\u002B\u002B programming and will be able to create on your own various C\u002B\u002B programs and applications.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe structure of the course\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way this course have been structured and created is made to really help you learn and understand all the basics of this programming language. From the starting point where you will be installing the right tools and writing you first basic lines of code to the more advanced such as functions, statements, loops and many pratical projects, this course has everything you need to start programming in C\u002B\u002B and begin your programmation journey. Also, this course has been created to help you learn all the basics concepts that are the core of C\u002B\u002B programmation. This way, you will not only program in this language but you will also understand the logic behind this programming language and will be able to create various applications in it on your own. Indeed, if you don\u0027t have prior programming experience, the hardest part is understanding the programming logic and this course covers all the topics to help you succed in C\u002B\u002B programming.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, this course is built around a very simple but effective logic that is learning by practice. In other words, this course is definely not theoritical even if it contains some theoritical concepts. Indeed, this course is build on a logic of learning by practice. In other words, you will find various C\u002B\u002B exercices all over the course to help you master this programming language and achieve your end goal of learning how to program is C\u002B\u002B.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFor who is this course designed\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a lot of C\u002B\u002B course that exist all over the internet. But, this course is different, all the concepts that you will find in this course are simplified to help you understand them more in depth and more easilly. Also, each element that is presented in this course comes with a multitude of various programming examples that will alow you to practice everything that you will learn all over the course. In other words, if you never wrote a single line of code or did any programming prior this course and you always wanted to start somewhere then you will probably love this course. The way this course is presented and structured is here to help you achieve your obective of starting in the programming world and have a solid understanding of C\u002B\u002B programming by the end of this course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy should I take this course\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf programming in C\u002B\u002B is something that you always had a passion for and you always wanted to learn more about that programming language then you should definitely take this course.

Zero trust architectures simplify network infrastructure, make users happier, and keep cyberthreats at a distance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince John Kindervag, then at Forrester Research, coined the phrase, zero trust architectures follow the maxim \u0022never trust, always verify.\u0022 To block inappropriate access and lateral movement throughout an environment, zero trust architecture enforces access policies based on context\u2014including the user\u0027s role and location, the device they\u0027re using, and the data they\u0027re asking for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA zero trust architecture means you know who\u0027s using what, and you can track it, including encrypted traffic; you need to monitor and verify the traffic between parts of the environment; and you need multifactor authentication (MFA) that goes beyond passwords.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn important thing to remember is that in a zero trust architecture, a resource\u0027s location isn\u0027t as important as before. Rather than rigid network segmentation, software-defined microsegmentation protects your data, workflows, services, and such anywhere, in your data center or distributed hybrid or multicloud.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy using a network-centric data security strategy that provides specific access only to those who need it, Zero Trust Architecture focuses on the business needs and functionality of an organization. By enabling parameters to dictate access and restrictions, the Zero Trust model views data security from a whole new perspective. As opposed to legacy networks that have little to no visibility or control over network and data usage, Zero Trust Architectures see all network traffic through segmentation gateways with granular policies governing access to data, apps, and assets. There are certain rules that have to be followed before a resource can be accessed in a Zero Trust network.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe five major topics I want to cover in this master\u0027s course are\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

We\u0027re better at receiving and processing information, and finding solutions with it. Our intrinsic sense of justice is rooted in empathy, which strengthens bonds of trust.
