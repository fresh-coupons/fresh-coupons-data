Adobe Lightroom focuses on the editing of the RAW images and helps the user to control adjustments such as brightness and contrast, exposure, hue/saturation, and other properties on the Raw files itself. Lightroom is a global program that works on the editing of the whole of the image while Photoshop is different software that works on the pixels and minimal details of the image. Lightroom has many advanced presets installed that can perform many functions based on editing and manipulation images but it cannot perform complex editing that Photoshop can perform.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis Lightroom CC Course is designed for every image editor and photographer whether beginner or an experienced. The course will provide practical and theoretical techniques and examples of how to edit and manipulate raw images and a group of images simultaneously.

The process of zero-based budgeting starts from a \u0022zero base,\u0022 and every function within an organization is analyzed for its needs and costs. The budgets are then built around what is needed for the upcoming period, regardless of whether each budget is higher or lower than the previous one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETraditional budgeting calls for incremental increases over previous budgets, such as a 2% increase in spending, as opposed to a justification of both old and new expenses, as called for with zero-based budgeting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETraditional budgeting also only analyzes only new expenditures, while ZBB starts from zero and calls for a justification of old, recurring expenses in addition to new expenditures. Zero-based budgeting aims to put the onus on managers to justify expenses and aims to drive value for an organization by optimizing costs and not just revenue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs per the latest Survey by Delloitte zero-based budgeting users appear to be moderately more successful at meeting their cost targets. Sixty-three percent of respondents, globally, who did not conduct ZBB did not meet their cost targets, while the same is true for 58 percent of those that did use ZBB. Although ZBB users in the US reported higher cost program failure rates than non-ZBB users (65 percent vs. 57 percent), in all other regions the failure rate for ZBB users was lower than for non-ZBB users (57 percent failure rate vs. 68 percent in Latin America; 52 percent vs. 56 percent in Europe; and 60 percent vs. 71 percent in the Asia Pacific).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this course we will explore practical aspects of Zero Based Budgeting.\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/fundamentals-of-zero-based-budgeting/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4525756_f75a.jpg","duration":"1 total hour","enrolledStudentsCount":"1,843.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["business leaders","business managers","financial professional"],"tags":["Business Budgeting","Business Plan","Financial Planning"],"rating":{"count":18,"averageValue":"4.3"},"instructors":[{"name":"Manish Gupta","url":"/user/manish-224/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.1666665},{"name":"TA eHMS","url":"/user/marrypie/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":4.1666665}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"A79C26F45D68FD2ADEE5","originalPrice":"\u20B91,499","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"2 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/character-modeling-in-blender/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":2290419,"title":"Character Modeling in Blender.
