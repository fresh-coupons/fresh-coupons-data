Here, in this course, you will be fascinated by how far artificial intelligence has advanced nowadays. If I told you a couple years ago that you can generate a full podcast and clone your own voice using AI, most likely, you won\u2019t believe those technologies actually exist. Nonetheless, what if I told you that today you can utilise AI to generate a full podcast episode and not only that you can also clone your voice, then, integrate that new voice to your podcast host that was created using AI. For those of you who might assume that the process is going to be very complicated, you are mistaken. As matter of fact, the process is relatively simple and straightforward, all you need to do is to describe what would be the topic of your podcast and do some minor customisations like choosing your podcast host and choosing the voice for that host. Meanwhile, for cloning your voice, all you need to do is to upload an audio file of your sample voice and artificial intelligence will automatically generate the clone version of your voice. In the introduction session, you will learn basic fundamentals of the podcast and you will also get to know several strategies that can be implemented to retain your podcast viewers.Then, continue by going over several podcast topic ideas that you should consider, such as alternate history, science fiction, and politics. Afterward, you will also learn how artificial intelligence can help you to automate and speed up your podcast production process, such as converting text to speech, removing background noise, and generating content scripts for podcasts. In the next session, you will extensively learn the technology behind AI voice cloning as well as get to know more about AI tools that we will be using, such as Speechify, Play HT, and My Vocal AI. Then, we will also go over several podcast hosting platforms that you might want to consider, for example Spotify, Pod Bean, and Cast box. Once you\u2019ve learnt all necessary knowledge about automating podcasts and cloning voice with AI, you will enter the main section of the course which is the project session. In the first project, you will be guided step by step on how to create podcast episodes using AI tools like Pod Bot, Pod Castle, All in Pod, Slayer, Magic Cast, and Pod Pilot. Whereas, in the second project you will learn step by step on how to clone your own voice using Speechify, Play HT, and My Vocal AI. Once both projects have been completed, you will also learn how to monetise your podcast through several business models as well as how to grow your podcast audiences.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, we need to ask ourselves these questions, why should we automate podcast production using AI? And why should we clone our voice? Well, in my opinion, there are many reasons why, first of all, podcasts have been getting a lot of attention in the past few years as more and more people started to get their entertainment, information, and education from podcasts. Therefore, it is definitely not surprising to know that the market value of podcasts in 2023 has reached more than twenty three billion dollars and it is still projected to increase in the next couple years. This is basically a strong indication that podcasts have a bright future and there is a huge potential for you to turn this side hustle into a sustainable business. In addition to that, as artificial intelligence has advanced very rapidly in the past few years, why not integrate AI with podcasts to automate and speed up the production process. Can you imagine how much time and energy that you can potentially save if you utilise AI to its fullest extent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow are things that you can expect to learn from this course:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn basic fundamentals of Podcast and several strategies to retain your podcast views\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how AI can help you to automate and speed up your podcast production process\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn the technology behind cloning voice using AI, from sample voice data collection to speech synthesis\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGet to know several platforms to host your podcast like Spotify, Pod Bean, Pine Cast, Spreaker, and CastBox\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to generate a podcast content using Podbot AI, All in Pod AI, Slayer AI, Magic Cast AI, and Pod Pilot AI\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to convert text to speech using Pod Castle AI\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to remove background noise from the audio using Pod Castle AI\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to clone your voice using Speechify AI, Play HT, and My Vocal AI\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn several business models to monetise your podcast\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn several efficient marketing strategies to promote your podcast and reach broader audience\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/automating-podcast-production-cloning-your-voice-with-ai/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5518034_f880.jpg","duration":"2.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"377.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["People who are interested to start a podcast","People who are interested in incorporating podcast to their contents","People who are interested to clone their voices using AI"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":0,"averageValue":"0.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"Christ Raharja","url":"/user/christ-raharja/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":0}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"3C4660290D5CA5BF3780","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"3 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/time-management-productivity-decision-making-tools-aids/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4821416,"title":"Time Management, Productivity, Decision Making Tools \u0026  Aids","shortDescription":"Tools, aids, tips and kits to help improve personal productivity","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EFor many of us, productivity is a massive struggle.

You will Learn from the best Business and Make Profit !","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EThere\u2019s a HUGE difference between simply operating a used car dealership business and operating a profitable used car dealership. To get a better idea of the possible demand for used cars in your area, you\u2019ll need to crunch some numbers. By knowing the number of used cars sold in your area every year and month , you can estimate what percentage of the market you will be likely to be able to corner and reach. By locating the average profit per vehicle, you can get an approximate idea of how much profit and money your dealership able to make per year. While the groundwork associated with opening a dealership can be time-consuming, expensive, and demanding, the real test of your dealership\u2019s viability doesn\u2019t begin until after you open your doors to the public. Without the right management of your dealership, all the effort you put into laying the foundation will be wasted. While each state has its own rules and regulations, there are several important universal aspects of operating a car dealership and tips on how you can get the most out of your investment. Your customers are the single most important factor in the success or failure of your business, so taking the time to identify who they are and what they care about is absolutely vital. Take a look at the types of cars you plan on selling, then do some research to determine the age, gender, and income level of the average individual who owns those types of vehicles. Later down the line, this will allow you to tailor your marketing and advertising efforts toward those who are most likely to be interested in what you have to offer. Make sure to base any of your conclusions regarding your target clients on real actionable data; don\u2019t simply make assumptions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/car-flipping-earn-money-from-selling-used-cars-ocsaly/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4741312_7b69_3.jpg","duration":"1.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"26,201.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Beginner Used Car Business Leaders"],"tags":["Car Flipping"],"rating":{"count":83,"averageValue":"4.1"},"instructors":[{"name":"OCSALY Academy | 240.000\u002B Students","url":"/user/online-academy-of-computer-science/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":3.9}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"CAR-SELLING-2023","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"2 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/digital-dropshipping-masterkurs/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4090068,"title":"Digital Dropshipping: Das NEUE Gesch\u00E4ftsmodell","shortDescription":"#1 Digitaler Dropshipping Kurs: Die Schritt f\u00FCr Schritt Anleitung f\u00FCr den Verkauf \u0026 Vermarktung von DIGITALEN Produkten","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDu bist unprofitabel mit deinem Dropshipping Shop oder hast noch nicht einmal angefangen?

Depression is different from usual mood fluctuations and short-lived emotional responses to challenges in everyday life. Especially when long-lasting and with moderate or severe intensity, depression may become a serious health condition. It can cause the affected person to suffer greatly and function poorly at work, at school and in the family. At its worst, depression can lead to suicide.

In this course you will learn how to develop stylish, mobile responsive web pages right from scratch using some of the most powerful front-end mark-up languages and JavaScript libraries. The course starts with an in-depth overview of HTML where we start by exploring the structure of an HTML web page. Once you\u2019re comfortable with HTML foundations, we move on to demonstrating how to work with a number of HTML elements. This includes: Inline text elements, ordered and unordered lists, embedding media, link creation, tables, background images, form elements and iframes. The HTML segment concludes with a hands-on project that will guide you through creating a complete web page with headers, footers, callouts, images, links, forms and tabular data. By the end of the HTML segment, you\u2019ll be able to proficiently code simple and complex html pages with ease.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe second section of this course focuses exclusively on CSS to bring your web pages to life with custom style sheets. Here, students will learn the importance of responsive design and cross browser compatibility by embedding CSS style rules for individual page components. We start by exploring the parts, and types of CSS rules followed by an introduction into CSS Id\u2019s and divisions. From there we move on to CSS margins, text properties, borders, transparency and text on top of images. Once you have a handle on the foundations we move on to more intricate CSS concepts including CSS positioning, CSS float properties, Link Styling, and z-indexes. Similar to the HTML section, the CSS segment concludes with a comprehensive hands-on guide to building a responsive web page, complete with CSS style definitions, element containers, navigation, and a number of other CSS page elements.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOnce you have a foundational understanding of HTML and CSS, we will dive into working with React, a powerful JavaScript library used for front-end UI development. The React section starts off with a hands-on project where you\u2019ll learn how to work with functional React components, props, Callback functions, OnClick Events, and the React State hook to build a fully functional calculator. From there we will dive into project number two, where you will build a connect-4 clone. Here we will cover more intermediate concepts including passing props, destructuring, passing arguments to click events, various styling methods, and handling callbacks. You will also learn about the React key property, React lifecycle events, and conditional rendering. By the end you will have built a complete multi and single player connect-4 game board with built-in AI capabilities.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn the final section of the course we further unleash the power of React by building out a complete e-commerce site with multiple product categories, a product showcase, shopping cart feature, and much more. Here, we introduce a number of integral new concepts including: JSON server, Fetch API, and installing React router. These essential building blocks will be used to render the product categories, style the product list, and configure the product details page. From there we dive into styled components, refactoring the shop layout, and exploring the concept of \u201Ccontext\u201D in React. In the final stages of the project students will configure the shopping cart basket, and the checkout feature. We will also implement a product search feature, followed by in-depth exercises on validating input forms in React.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAs you can see this course covers a tremendous bit of ground.

In this course you will learn how to use JavaScript along with two powerful JavaScript libraries to build dynamic, interactive web pages. We start with introducing students to the document object model (DOM) which defines the logical structure of HTML documents. From there we dive into JavaScript to demonstrate various methods in which DOM elements can be manipulated to add interactivity to static components. The JavaScript section starts right from the basics, which includes JavaScript placement, and data output. From there we move on to variable declaration, arithmetic operations, operator precedence, data types, and objects. Once the foundations are covered, we move on to more complex operations using Arrays, Conditional Statements, JavaScript comparison operators, booleans and loops. Here students will learn to unleash the true power of JavaScript to render different outcomes based on user interaction. We will explore the use of functions to efficiently handle repetitive tasks and JavaScript events to handle output based on actions and occurrences. The section will conclude with a hands-on project where students will implement their knowledge to build a web based photo gallery and background color changer.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn the second section of this course, students will learn to work with jQuery - a powerful JavaScript library designed to simplify HTML DOM tree traversal and manipulation. jQuery is ultra lightweight, feature rich, and cross-platform compatible. It\u2019s one of the easiest libraries to work with for building out JavaScript features on an HTML web page. jQuery is excellent for event handling, CSS animations, and Ajax integration for asynchronous UI state changes. Similar to the JavaScript section, the jQuery module begins with the foundations. This includes instructions on embedding jQuery to a web page, and an intro into jQuery syntax. Students will learn to work with jQuery selectors, events, and toggling. From there we dive into animations using fades, slides, and the jQuery animate function. Students also learn about chaining, draggable objects, callback functions, the get content method, toggling classes, and filtering. By the end of the jQuery module, you will know how to build stunning animated web pages with ease.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn the last section of this course we\u2019ll explore React - a cutting edge JavaScript library for building state-of-the art user interface components. You\u2019ve likely seen React in action on some of the hottest web apps developed by fortune 500 companies. For example, Netflix, Facebook, and AirBnB all use React for their front-end UI. As a matter of fact, React was developed by Meta alongside a community of independent developers. Until this day, React remains free and open-source so it has plenty of support and documentation. Unlike jQuery which interacts with the document object model directly, React works through a \u201Cvirtual\u201D DOM. React is unaware of changes made to the DOM outside of React and determines updates based on its own internal representations. React is best for creating reusable code blocks for UI components and layering them on top of each other to minimize the number of times the DOM needs to be re-rendering on state changes. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe React section of this course starts off with a hands-on project where you\u2019ll learn how to work with functional React components, props, Callback functions, OnClick Events, and the React State hook to build a fully functional calculator.
