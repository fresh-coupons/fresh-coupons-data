The process of writing the software itself involves the planning required for developing the product. The key principle of the RAD process is a reduction in planning to focus on a highly iterative design and construction process, enabling teams to accomplish more in less time, without impacting client satisfaction. Apart from a shorter time-to-market, one of the most significant advantages of RAD is client involvement. RAD emphasizes incremental and iterative delivery of functioning models to the client instead of following a rigid process model like the traditional SDLC. Depends on strong team and individual performances for identifying business requirements. Only system that can be modularized can be built using RAD. Requires highly skilled developers/designers. High dependency on modeling skills. Only suitable for scalable, component-based systems \u2013 RAD is best used for large systems with multiple components. This is because, using RAD, many pre-developed components will be used, and it\u0027s not cost-effective to create a single component or piece of software for a smaller company.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this specialised master course you can learn the specialized topics of:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

field of Cloud Computing, its enabling technologies, main building blocks, and hands-on experience through projects utilizing public cloud infrastructures (Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure). Cloud computing allows you to store and access data and programs in the virtual platform instead of your computer\u0027s hard drive. Cloud management makes it possible to track and allocate the company\u0027s expenses in cloud computing, generate reports, and predict future loads. Thus, it provides accurate cost management, forecasting, and reporting. Cloud computing can be accessed from anywhere and anytime. Cloud computing services are being adopted widely across a variety of organizations and in many domains. Simply, cloud computing is the delivery of computing as a service over a network, whereby distributed resources are rented, rather than owned, by an end user as a utility.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStudents will work with Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, use them to rent and provision compute resources and then program and deploy applications that run on these resources.

Students will gain hands-on experience solving relevant problems through projects that will utilize existing public cloud tools. It is our objective that students will develop the skills needed to become a practitioner or carry out research projects in this domain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStudents will learn how virtualization can allow software and hardware images (e.g., virtual machines) to run side-by-side on a single cloud data center while provided security, resource and failure isolations. They will understand how virtualization enables clouds to offer software, computation, and storage as services as well as attain agility and elasticity properties.

The unique feature of Random forest is supervised learning. What it means is that data is segregated into multiple units based on conditions and formed as multiple decision trees. These decision trees have minimal randomness (low Entropy), neatly classified and labeled for structured data searches and validations. Little training is needed to make the data models active in various decision trees.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe success of Random forest depends on the size of the data set. More the merrier.

We live in an era of sound bites and 140 character messages, but good writing still matters when it comes to marketing your business.

If you\u2019ve ever read a poorly-written copy, you know the opposite occurs.

They\u2019re busy. They have other media competing for their attention. Make it easy and enjoyable for them to glide through your paragraphs. Good writing is simple. It\u2019s easy to understand. It lacks unnecessary complexity. The vocabulary is varied but not pretentious. Weed out extra words to improve clarity. Get rid of redundancies, cliches and fluff. Delete energy-sapping words like: very, really, just, quite and rather. What makes writing even more interesting than its style is its substance. Focus on content over craft. Deliver your message in its purest form. Your content will pack more power and inspire a greater response.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Art of Persuasion Begins With Good Copy\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThink of your copy\u2013whether for an ad, brochure or website\u2013as your secret salesperson.

Those are all basic questions that you\u2019ll be considering for each new client you get and the answers will help inform your copywriting for that client.

This Microcontroller is called\u0026nbsp;DigiSpark.\u0026nbsp;It is a microcontroller\u0026nbsp;based on the Attiny85 development board. It is similar to Arduino but smaller and more powerful in terms of\u0026nbsp;hacking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstalling backdoors, exfiltrating documents, or capturing credentials is incredibly easy with a seemingly innocent USB drive called the USB\u0026nbsp; Rubber Ducky. An Expert hacker with a few minutes, photographic memory,\u0026nbsp; and perfect typing accuracy can use a few well-crafted keystrokes to hack virtually anything they have physical access to. However, the proper hardware can do the same thing every time on demand without fail.\u0026nbsp; That\u2019s where the Rubber Ducky and other Human Interface Devices (HID)\u0026nbsp; come into play. They inject keystrokes at superhuman speeds, violating computers\u0027 inherent trust in humans by posing as a keyboard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this class, we\u2019ll learn more about what HID attacks are, how they work,\u0026nbsp; the social engineering that can be involved in their deployment, and how to use them in your Pen-testing engagements. Keyboards announce themselves to computers as HID devices and are in turn automatically recognized and accepted. We\u0027ll program a microcontroller in Arduino to take advantage of this by acting as an HID device. We can then create scripts that run when the device is plugged into a target computer. All at only a fraction of the cost of the more well-branded USB Rubber\u0026nbsp; Ducky!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStudents will learn to use a low-cost Digispark to program their payloads for use in Ethical Hacking and Penetration testing. We\u0027ll go over creating more advanced loads, including tracking payloads that run in the background, as well as Rickroll payloads that can be used with permission from friends and family to demonstrate how HID attacks work. Additionally, students learn to automate nearly anything on an unattended device which can be extremely useful when you need to run the same commands on a series of computers.\u0026nbsp; That\u2019s how the Original USB Ruber Ducky was invented. Hak5 founder\u0026nbsp; Darren Kitchen, while working as a sysadmin, got tired of typing the same commands to fix printers and network shares, again and again, and the device evolved out of laziness. He programmed a development board to emulate the typing for him - and thus the keystroke injection attack was born.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0647\u0644 \u0635\u0646\u0627\u0639\u0647 \u062C\u0647\u0627\u0632 \u0631\u0627\u0628\u0631 \u062F\u0643\u064A\u061F\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u062F\u0639\u0646\u0627 \u0646\u062A\u0639\u0631\u0641 \u0639\u0644\u0649\u0026nbsp;

CART is a predictive algorithm used in Machine learning and it explains how the target variable\u2019s values can be predicted based on other matters. It is a decision tree where each fork is split into a predictor variable and each node has a prediction for the target variable at the end. Classically, this algorithm is referred to as decision trees, but on some platforms like R they are referred to by the more modern term CART. The CART algorithm provides a foundation for important algorithms like bagged decision trees, random forest and boosted decision trees.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs the name suggests, CART (Classification and Regression Trees) can be used for both classification and regression problems. The difference lies in the target variable. That is, With classification, we attempt to predict a class label. In other words, classification is used for problems where the output (target variable) takes a finite set of values, e.g., whether it will rain tomorrow or not. Meanwhile, regression is used to predict a numerical label. This means your output can take an infinite set of values, e.g., a house price.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDecision Trees are an important type of algorithm for predictive modeling machine learning. The classical decision tree algorithms have been around for decades and modern variations like random forest are among the most powerful techniques available. In this post you will discover the humble decision tree algorithm known by it\u2019s more modern name CART which stands for Classification And Regression Trees. The web is full of apps that are driven by data. All the e-commerce apps and websites are based on data in the complete sense. There is database behind a web front end and middleware that talks to a number of other databases and data services. But the mere use of data is not what comprises of data science. A data application gets its value from data and in the process creates value for itself. This means that data science enables the creation of products that are based on data. This course includes learning decision tree modeling which are used by data scientists or people who inspire to be the data scientist.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Decision Tree Algorithm is one of the popular supervised type machine learning algorithms that is used for classifications. This algorithm generates the outcome as the optimized result based upon the tree structure with the conditions or rules. The decision tree algorithm associated with three major components as Decision Nodes, Design Links, and Decision Leaves. It operates with the Splitting, pruning, and tree selection process. It supports both numerical and categorical data to construct the decision tree. Decision tree algorithms are efficient for large data set with less time complexity.

I know in additional to being afraid of the dark and height, speaking in front of others is a fear my child has exhibited. I like the way the Instructors talked directly to the child on the videos and used examples children could relate. I like the flow of the class. I learned there is a \u201Cmagic phrase.\u201D I also learned to have my child to use the video that is on the PC, SmartPhone and Tablet as tool to help them with this skill. I could relate to several examples of what not to do. The Instructor teaches from the view of an experienced Media Personality.

This is a comprehensive project-based course where you will learn step by step on how to perform complex analysis and visualization on infectious diseases datasets. This course is a perfect combination between biostatistics and Python, equipping you with the tools and techniques to tackle real-world challenges in public health. The course will be mainly concentrating on three major aspects, the first one is data analysis where you will explore the infectious diseases data from multiple perspectives, the second one is time series forecasting where you will be guided step by step on how to forecast the spread of infectious diseases using STL model, and the third one is public health policy where you will learn how to make a data driven public health policy based on epidemiological modeling. In the introduction session, you will learn the basic fundamentals of biostatistics, such as getting to know more about challenges that we commonly face when analyzing biostatistics data and statistical models that we will use, for instance STL which stands for seasonal trend decomposition. Then, you will continue by learning how to calculate infectious disease transmission using Kermack-McKendrick equation, this is a very important concept that you need to understand before getting into the coding session. Afterward, you will also learn several factors that can potentially accelerate the spread of infectious diseases, such as population density, healthcare accessibility, and antigenic variation. Once you have learnt all necessary information about biostatistics, we will start the project. Firstly, you will be guided step by step on how to set up Google Colab IDE. Not only that, you will also learn how to find and download infectious diseases dataset from Kaggle. Once, everything is ready, we will enter the main section of the course which is the project section The project will be consisted of three main parts, the first part is to conduct exploratory data analysis, the second part is to build forecasting model to predict the spread of the diseases in the future using time series model, meanwhile the third part is to perform epidemiological modelling and use the result to develop a public health policy to slow down the spread of the infectious disease.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, before getting into the course, we need to ask this question to ourselves: why should we learn biostatistics, particularly infectious diseases analysis? Well, there are many reasons why, firstly, if you are interested in working in the public health or healthcare industry, having biostatistics knowledge would be very beneficial and help you to level up your career. In addition to that, you will also learn a lot of valuable skill sets that can be implemented in other projects, for example, time series decomposition can be used to forecast stock, real estate, commodity, and cryptocurrency markets. Last but not least, this course will also train you to be a better public health policy maker as you will extensively learn how to make data driven decisions and take other external factors into consideration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow are things that you can expect to learn from this course:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn the basic fundamentals of biostatistics and infectious disease analysis\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to calculate infectious disease transmission rate using SIR model\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn several factors that accelerate the spread of infectious disease, such as population density, herd immunity, and antigenic variation\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to find and download datasets from Kaggle\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to clean dataset by removing missing rows and duplicate values\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to detect potential outliers using Z score method\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to find correlation between population and disease rate\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to analyze infected patient demographics\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to map infectious disease per county using heatmap\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to analyze infectious disease yearly trend\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to perform confidence interval analysis\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to forecast infectious disease rate using time series decomposition model\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to do epidemiological modeling using SIR model\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to perform public health policy evaluation\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-biostatistics-analyzing-infectious-diseases-data/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5623864_3824.jpg","duration":"3 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"1,228.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["People who are interested in learning biostatistics","People who are interested in analysing infectious disease dataset"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":0,"averageValue":"0.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"Christ Raharja","url":"/user/christ-raharja/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":0}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"A417897BE7BEF79A58CC","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"\u20B9449","expirationText":"1 day","discountPercentage":44}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/gitlab-course-ci-cd/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5454834,"title":"Ultimate GitLab CI/CD Course: Mastering DevOps Pipeline[\u002723]","shortDescription":"Mastering GitLab Pipelines from Scratch to Expert: A Comprehensive Guide to CI/CD with GitLab [Latest 2023 Curriculum]","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMastering GitLab Pipelines from Scratch to Expert: A Comprehensive Guide to CI/CD with GitLab\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnlock the full potential of GitLab CI/CD in this all-inclusive course that covers everything from the basics to advanced features.
