Indeed, since this is a new science there is a few places where you can find a quality introduction course about this topic. Indeed, usually all the course are either to advanced or simply does not cover properly the topic of quantum computing. But, this course is designed to give you all the basic knowledge about the topic. If you :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Are a student and want to learn about new technologies\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Are interested about this topic but don\u0027t know were to find good resources about it\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Want to know how to work with different tools used for quantum computing\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Simply curious about the topic and you want to learn more about it\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen this course is definitely for you and you will love it. Not only you will learn different theoretical concepts that are really useful in quantum computing but you will also use different tools to practice everything that you have learned.

Indeed, you will at first learn all the basics of mathematics especially linear algebra. Once again, you will not become a specialist in this field but you will at least understand the basic concepts of it that can be useful for your understanding of quantum computing. Then, you will learn what exactly is an algorithm and what is the difference between a quantum algorithm and a classical mathematical algorithm. Also, we are going to cover different quantum algorithms that are also really popular in this field. Finally, you will have an introduction to Microsoft Q. In my opinion this is pretty important to learn because this is the programming language that is used to perform different quantum calculations as well as testing or running different quantum apps. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, it\u0027s really important to understand that I created this course on the Principe of learning by practice. This is why even if this course is mostly theoretical, I\u0026nbsp;tried to implement as much practice as possible. This way, when you will have completed this course you will not only be able to understand the basics of what is quantum computing but you will also be able to write basic lines of code and have a basic understanding of different quantum algorithms.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFor who is this course designed\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis course is created for beginners who have no prior knowledge of what is quantum computing and are interested by the topic.
