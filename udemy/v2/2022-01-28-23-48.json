The definition of Scrum consists of roles, events, artifacts, and the rules that bind them together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScrum defines three roles, the Product Owner, Scrum Master and Development Team Member.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScrum is:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELightweight\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimple to understand\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDifficult to master\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat is the difference between Scrum and Agile Development?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgile Development is a software methodology, whereas Scrum is one of process frameworks that follows Agile. Scrum is advised to teams with experienced team members as the Framework requires great collaboration and self-organization as well. If the Scrum rules are not followed strictly, a project can lead to failure. Hence, it is necessary to have a proper understanding of Scrum concepts among the entire team.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy do we need Scrum?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou don\u2019t \u201Cneed\u201D it, per se.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut to be successful at building products and services which generate value for your customers and your business in rapidly changing circumstances, you do need a way of managing risk, optimizing value and navigating complexity in both the work and the surrounding environment. Scrum provides a framework for doing that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhen should I choose Scrum?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScrum best serves the projects with unclear details and specifications, ones with high risk of mid-project changes, where there is a need to monitor the value of completed tasks throughout and where teams need autonomy and creativity to produce the best results.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith Scrum your team will:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDeliver the main value quicker\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave a bigger chance of meeting the deadline\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECreate the product for less\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBe more motivated\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECollaborate better\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBe more innovative and listen to client requirements more careful\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhen should I not choose Scrum?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScrum application can be complicated in large teams or those very attached to the traditional process. It will also not be a good fit for those that expect a light and quick change into better results. Otherwise, it simply takes determination and will to take on the process and adapt it to your needs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIs Scrum Master a job title or a role that someone with an existing job title fills?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScrum Master is a role that someone with a job title fills. Normal practice is that the person playing the role of project manager plays the ScrumMaster\u2019s role as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECan Product Owner and ScrumMaster\u2019s roles be played by the same person?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, since the ownership differs. The role of Product Owner and ScrumMaster are very much mutually exclusive. Product Owner takes care of the Product Backlog, Prioritization of User Stories, and Validation of the working product increment with the user stories allocated to the Sprint.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHow might Scrum work for research projects?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScrum can be applied to any project where the goal is to maximize the value of something (a \u201Cproduct\u201D), and thus requires short feedback loops in order to govern what actually gets delivered and ends up being valuable. Research fits nicely in this category because, by definition, it is about learning something in order to achieve a broader purpose.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat about Professional Scrum Certification?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are various Professional Scrum Certifications available including \u003Cstrong\u003EProfessional Scrum Master\u2122, Professional Scrum Product Owner\u2122, Professional Scrum Developer\u2122, Scaled Professional Scrum\u2122, Professional Scrum\u2122 with Kanban, Professional Agile Leadership\u2122 and Professional Scrum\u2122 with User Experience.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese assessments cover a range of areas related to the knowledge and real world usage of Scrum.
