A unique way to be consistant in time.","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EChartism, technical analysis and indicators are past due. Today\u00B4s traders must be one step ahead. The mainstream of knowledge in trading is still around the same algorithms and old school of the 80\u2019 and 90\u2019. The demands of the market today are currently beyond the reach of traders in years past. This course will get your trading to the next level so open yourself up to a new way of thinking. The journey to becoming a successful trader is not an easy one, but with patience and perseverance, it can be done. As you take this journey with me, remember that temperance and wisdom are essential components \u2013 they will help you make wise decisions in the market. With the right attitude and strategy, you can become both a successful and strategic trader.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; You can apply the price reading system in every instrument and also futures. The only requirement is that the asset must have a trading volume which is massive enough to have generated a market history. Without volume of transactions, the asset will have little activity and will not provide sufficient information. Many new instruments that go on the market do not yet have sufficient daily volume, and so price reading is not applicable. To conclude, it\u0027s important to remember the fundamentals of price action are supply and demand. Knowing how these two factors interplay is essential for traders who want to make informed decisions about when to buy and sell. While the market can be unpredictable, understanding price movements will help you build your trading strategy and potentially yield successful outcomes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp; The bottom line is that price action strategies can be applied to any asset, according to its history. Each asset has its own characteristics, so understanding the balance between supply and demand is key to success in the market. As a trader, it\u0027s important to analyze each asset\u0027s past performance and build an investment strategy around it. The more history one can bring into the equation, the better equipped they will be our entries with greater accuracy and expertise. After all, knowledge is power when it comes to investing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp; Price action equals market in action and that is behavior of buyers and sellers. While behaviorism does not provide any guarantees about the future, it can help us analyze the historical data that is available in order to better understand how our actions impact the financial market. By being aware of our behavior and recognizing patterns, we can become more effective and strategic in our decisions. As we continue to study this field, we may find even more ways for people to better understand their attitude towards, and reactions to, favorable or unfavorable market conditions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp; While price action may be complicated to understand at first, with practice it blends into the background and can become second nature. Unlike other strategies, price action does not use indicators for decision-making - but rather relies on your individual judgment of market opportunities at any given moment. The most important concept it is not only understand price action factor in trading, but also applying it with scalping techniques to maximize success. With patience and attention to detail, you can unlock tremendous profits by taking advantage of short-term price changes in the market.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/mastering-price-action-trading-in-online-trading/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5603568_dc8c_8.jpg","duration":"3.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"305.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["Traders lacking consistency in trading results over time"],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":64,"averageValue":"5.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"Karina Fabi","url":"/user/karina-fabi-2/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":5}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"JAN2025","originalPrice":"\u20B92,299","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"4 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/3d-modeling-with-fusion-360tutorial-videos/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":6281331,"title":"3D Modeling with Fusion 360 (Tutorial Videos)","shortDescription":"Step-by-Step Guide to Fusion 360","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EThis course offers an in-depth exploration of Autodesk Fusion 360, guiding you through every aspect of 3D modeling and design.
