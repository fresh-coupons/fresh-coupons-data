It was introduced by American engineer Bill Smith while working at Motorola in 1986. A six sigma process is one in which 99.99966% of all opportunities to produce some feature of a part are statistically expected to be free of defects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESix Sigma strategies seek to improve manufacturing quality by identifying and removing the causes of defects and minimizing variability in manufacturing and business processes. It does this by using empirical and statistical quality management methods and by hiring people who serve as Six Sigma experts. Each Six Sigma project follows a defined methodology and has specific value targets, such as reducing pollution or increasing customer satisfaction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe term \u003Cem\u003ESix Sigma\u003C/em\u003E originates from statistical modeling of manufacturing processes. The maturity of a manufacturing process can be described by a \u003Cem\u003Esigma\u003C/em\u003E rating indicating its yield or the percentage of defect-free products it creates\u2014specifically, to within how many standard deviations of a normal distribution the fraction of defect-free outcomes corresponds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHistory\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMotorola pioneered Six Sigma, setting a \u0022six sigma\u0022 goal for its manufacturing business. It registered Six Sigma as a service mark on June 11, 1991 U.S. Service Mark 1,647,704; on December 28, 1993, it registered Six Sigma as a trademark. In 2005 Motorola attributed over $17 billion in savings to Six Sigma.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHoneywell and General Electric were also early adopters of Six Sigma. As GE\u0027s CEO, in 1995 Jack Welch made it central to his business strategy, and in 1998 it announced $350 million in cost savings thanks to Six Sigma, which was an important factor in the spread of Six Sigma (this figure later grew to more than $1 billion). By the late 1990s, about two-thirds of the Fortune 500 organizations had begun Six Sigma initiatives with the aim of reducing costs and improving quality.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn recent years, some practitioners have combined Six Sigma ideas with lean manufacturing to create a methodology named Lean Six Sigma. The Lean Six Sigma methodology views lean manufacturing, which addresses process flow and waste issues, and Six Sigma, with its focus on variation and design, as complementary disciplines aimed at promoting \u0022business and operational excellence\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn 2011, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has published the first standard \u0022ISO 13053:2011\u0022 defining a Six Sigma process.

The Google Ads platform focuses on Pay Per Click (PPC) ads, where advertisers pay per impression on an ad. PPC marketing is a tailorable, affordable form of web marketing, but to succeed, and not waste money, you must take the right approach. Typically it takes many years of experience to gain the in-depth knowledge necessary to get the most out of your PPC campaign.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith this Google Ads course, we aim to get you on the road to success faster, and as long as you are willing to put the work in, and apply our techniques and strategies, you\u0027ll be well equipped with everything you need to succeed. The strength of advertising with Google lies in its massive market reach and the ability it gives you to create highly targeted campaigns. With Google Ads you can drive quality traffic to your brand, garnered from people searching Google for products and services, similar to the ones you\u0027re offering.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo boost your reach, ads from Google often feature across other platforms, including YouTube, Blogger, and the Google Display Network. Another great feature of Google Ads is the Google Ads Analytics dashboard, which allows you to monitor the performance of your ads over time. This helps you hone the effectiveness of your Google Ads and adjust your content and target audience for a more optimal return on your investment. It\u0027s definitely worth investing in Google Ads, as even if you\u0027re ranking well organically, your results are likely to appear lower than those who have paid to promote. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWRITE GOOGLE ADS COPY THAT PEOPLE LOVE TO CLICK ON\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want maximum click throughs, you must use copywriting strategies that evoke strong emotion and are targeted to your ideal reader. The best type of AD COPIES are short and punchy, with enough impact to arouse curiosity, or provoke a reaction.

The keyword match types dictate how closely the keyword needs to match with the user\u2019s search query in order for the ad to be considered for the auction. So you could use broad match to serve your ad on a wider variety of user searches or you could use exact match to hone in on specific user searches.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EUSE EFFICIENTLY NEGATIVE KEYWORDS\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENegative keywords let you exclude search terms from your campaigns and help you focus on only the keywords that matter to your customers.

Then, we\u0027ll use your campaign to create ads on Google and around the web where potential customers can see what you\u0027re selling. We call these placements Shopping ads because they appear in a different, more visual format. In contrast to a text ad, which displays text only, Shopping ads show users a photo of your product, plus a title, price, store name, and more. These ads give users a strong sense of the product you\u0027re selling before they click the ad, which gives you more qualified leads.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECREATE VISUAL PERFORMANCE REPORTS WITH GOOGLE DATA STUDIO\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can add Ad Manager as a data source in Data Studio to create data visualisation reports.

At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Javascript to read and write files\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch text using regular expressions\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe topics covered in this course are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E*\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E javascript course contents:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript introduction\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript array\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript variables\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript functions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript objects\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript control statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript cookies\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript loop statements\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript data structures\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript error handling\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJavascript regular expressions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003Esection 3- learn PHP\u0026nbsp;programming language\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this section, we will learn the basic structure of a web application, and how a web browser interacts with a web server.

Fast forward to the future after 31 years, it is now the most commonly used program for creating graphs and pivot tables. However, many still believe it is just a mere tool for small business purposes. That\u2019s WRONG! Today, we are going to look at some of the major important purposes MS Excel is most used for.

With a vast program full of formulae, it can add, subtract, multiply and divide hundreds of numbers altogether, and can easily re-do it if a value is changed or added. This feature can be used to easily make a company\u2019s yearly sales and other spreadsheets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFormatting Options\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe various formatting options, including italics, highlighting, and colors, allow businesses to bring the most important data to be different from the rest. A number of tasks achieved through this tool are beyond impressive, with entire row highlighting and comparing lists and values to name a few. You can use them to highlight specific entries in Accounting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAvailability of Online Access\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EExcel is part of the Office 365 Productivity Suite, Which means that business employers and their employees can easily access their files over the cloud network, free from the bondages of file transfer.

More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data, i.e., it is an algebraic structure about data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EData structures serve as the basis for abstract data types (ADT). The ADT defines the logical form of the data type. The data structure implements the physical form of the data type.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDifferent types of data structures are suited to different kinds of applications, and some are highly specialized to specific tasks. For example, relational databases commonly use B-tree indexes for data retrieval,[6] while compiler implementations usually use hash tables to look up identifiers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EData structures provide a means to manage large amounts of data efficiently for uses such as large databases and internet indexing services. Usually, efficient data structures are key to designing efficient algorithms. Some formal design methods and programming languages emphasize data structures, rather than algorithms, as the key organizing factor in software design. Data structures can be used to organize the storage and retrieval of information stored in both main memory and secondary memory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"Ingl\u00E9s","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/top-interview-questions-tests-of-data-structures-and-algorithms1/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4430166_30c8.jpg","duration":"","enrolledStudentsCount":"0 estudiantes","lastUpdated":"Fecha de la \u00FAltima actualizaci\u00F3n: 12/2021","targetAudiences":["Programmers and Coders","Debuggers","Computer science practitioners","Teachers and CEOs","HR and Recruiters","Python and OOPs","Computer science scholars","Web Developers","Data scientists and machine learning engineers","Tech entrepreneurs and CEOs"],"tags":["Inform\u00E1tica y software","Certificaciones de inform\u00E1tica"],"rating":null,"instructors":[{"name":"SMARTER ACADEMY","url":"/user/haytham-hesham-elsayed-hashem-elmousalami/","totalNumberOfStudents":158723,"totalNumberOfReviews":1859,"averageRating":4.2331652644338105}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"40EEB0CCF24940D0651F","originalPrice":"12.800\u00A0\u20B9","discountedPrice":"8.320\u00A0\u20B9","expirationText":"5 saat","discountPercentage":35}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/risk-management-professional-pmi-rmp-questions/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4430524,"title":"TOP Risk Management Professional (PMI-RMP) Questions","shortDescription":"Boost your salary and Career ....
