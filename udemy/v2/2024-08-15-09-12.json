It allows developers to map Java objects to database tables and query data using an object-oriented approach, reducing the need for manual SQL. JPA is often used with frameworks like Hibernate to simplify database operations in Java applications.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe will integrate with HTML\u0026nbsp;to design the front-end, incorporating Thymeleaf and Bootstrap. We will inject the result sets from SQL Queries to the HTML\u0026nbsp; web pages. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThymeleaf is a modern server-side Java template engine for web and standalone environments. It enables dynamic generation of HTML, XML, and other text-based content. Thymeleaf integrates seamlessly with Spring and is designed to work in both web development (for creating views) and in non-web environments. It offers natural templating, meaning the templates are usable in a browser without requiring a web server, making it developer-friendly and effective for building web applications.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBootstrap is a popular open-source front-end framework used for designing responsive and mobile-first websites. It provides pre-designed templates, components (like buttons, forms, and navigation bars), and a grid system, enabling developers to create visually appealing and consistent layouts quickly. Bootstrap is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it simplifies the process of building websites that work well on various devices and screen sizes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou will enjoy this course tremendously and will be able to create useful applications.\u0026nbsp;

Firstly, you move in the correct direction when being attacked. Secondly, and this is important, you can see what\u2019s happening behind you in your fight for survival.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe teach a very simple system of self-defense when attacked from behind. Of course, you can\u2019t fight or defend yourself if you can\u2019t see the punch in the first place. This means that self-defense starts with simple situational awareness. You must be aware of your surroundings, and more importantly, you must be aware of what is happening behind you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith that in mind, there are simple measures that you can take to avoid being caught unaware. For example, when walking in urban environments avoid walking close to doorways, entrances, or intersections with other pathways. These are potential choke spots where people can step out to follow or grab you. Another helpful self-defense tip requires that you use the reflections of glass, windows, and cars to see what is happening around or behind you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving said that, being ambushed from behind can be rare, especially when there are lots of people in the street around you.

Simply awareness will suffice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, in the event that something should happen this course will help give you the knowledge and the self-defense steps that could make a difference if you are suddenly attacked from behind. Realistically, you will get punched in the face if someone runs up and attacks you from behind without any warning. So in this course, we look at ways to move and defend yourself if your attacker comes from behind. This gives you some chance to fight back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other aspect of this course is we will study the body mechanics of the attacker as it relates to the Yin Yang Principle of Kyusho Jutsu.\u0026nbsp; This principle can be studied in depth and can be very powerful when you understand the concepts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are 15 Principles of Kyusho Jutsu and Yin Yang is but one.\u0026nbsp; It is a principle that can be combined with other principles or it can stand on its own.\u0026nbsp; In Module 7 of my Kyusho Jutsu Black Belt course, I go through the other principles, but in this course, I have combined the Yin Yang Principle with Rear Attacks.\u0026nbsp; With this relation, you will begin to understand the principle better and be able to have greater control over your attacker.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn our Whiteboard lecture, I will discuss more on the Yin Yang Principle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJoin me in this course, as I teach you the pressure points of the body and how to effectively use them with Rear Attacks to defend yourself from your attacker.\u0026nbsp; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe objective of this course is to make you aware of the pressure point (Kyusho Jutsu) targets to move the odds of the fight in your favor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETWO\u0026nbsp;DOZEN drills and training exercises to help your understanding of using Pressure Points.\u0026nbsp; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPDF Course Notes for additional reading and research.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA great course, over 3 hours of instructional video.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for reading and looking forward to seeing you on the inside.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGrand Master Ali\u003C/p\u003E","language":"English","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/kyusho-jutsu-rear-attacks-the-yin-yang-principle/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5434754_ff10.jpg","duration":"3.5 total hours","enrolledStudentsCount":"821.000 students","lastUpdated":null,"targetAudiences":["For All Kyusho Jutsu practitioners from all levels.","For All Martial Artists practitioners from all levels."],"tags":[],"rating":{"count":0,"averageValue":"0.0"},"instructors":[{"name":"Grand Master Ali","url":"/user/muhammad-ali-1343/","totalNumberOfStudents":null,"totalNumberOfReviews":null,"averageRating":0}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"721A600ABA2725D26344","originalPrice":"\u20B9799","discountedPrice":"Free","expirationText":"3 days","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/beyond-healing-with-biogeometric-signatures/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":5511768,"title":"Beyond Healing with BioGeometric Signatures","shortDescription":"BioGeometric Signatures","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBioGeometry Signatures \u003C/strong\u003Eare a special branch of the science of BioGeometry.
