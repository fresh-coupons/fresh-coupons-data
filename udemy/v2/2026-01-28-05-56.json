Content creators for YouTube and social media often want a simplified workflow, and Filmora certainly provides that kind of editing experience. But does that mean it\u2019s something experienced editors should ignore? Not necessarily. Filmora9 does not have the features of professional software like Premiere, Final Cut, Media Composer, or Resolve.

Any editing program is going to have basic editing and transform controls, but Filmora9 also has basic compositing and audio tools. The program also features full 4K support (both UHD and DCI 4K).
