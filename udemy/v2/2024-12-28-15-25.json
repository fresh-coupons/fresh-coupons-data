Emergency physicians play a vital role in providing life-saving care to patients in need.\u0026nbsp; Emergency medicine is the medical specialty concerned with the care of illnesses or injuries requiring immediate medical attention. Emergency physicians, often called ER doctors, specialize in providing care for unscheduled and undifferentiated patients of all ages. They are trained to assess and treat a wide range of medical conditions, from minor injuries to life-threatening illnesses. \u003Cbr\u003EDominique Jean Larry, a French surgeon and military doctor\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Epracticing in the late 1700s, is often cited as the father of modern-day Prehospital Emergency Medicine (PHEM). His vision and commitment to provide care at the point of wounding, triage his patients on the basis of clinical need and transport them to battlefield hospitals in his flying ambulances was the blueprint of present-day PHEM\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Epractice. In the face of adversity, he provided contemporary medicine where patients needed it most, and at the same time created innovative practices such as triage . pride for our\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuch achievements remain inspirational today. The \u2018roots\u2019 of PHEM by this measure are admittedly short, especially when compared to those of hallowed medical establishments that can trace their practices and buildings back nearly 1000 years.

What is the purpose of studying how to lead a team? Aren\u0027t all leaders born and not made? If that is the truth, then millions of people are wasting their time trying to improve their leadership skills. Fortunately, trying to become a better leader is not a waste of time. While it is true that some leaders are born, most are made by studying what makes an effective leader.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this introductory unit, you will explore the four pillars of good management: management, leadership, groups, and teams. Management and leadership are often used interchangeably; the same applies for groups and teams. Management is about allocating resources; leadership is about empowering people. A group is a collection of individuals with a similar interest. Teams have a similar goal, but teams work together. A good leader will help a group and become a team\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo prepare you for this course, this unit concludes with a look at some great leaders in history. These four individuals are selected for their broad experiences and abilities to manage groups and teams. The spectrum goes from sports team management to inspiring political movements, and from brilliant corporate management to excellence in military and national leadership.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELeadership Theory\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPeople have studied leadership since ancient times, and theories of leadership have been around for centuries (Plato, Sun Tzu, Machiavelli, and so on). However, it wasn\u0027t until the 20th century that modern theories began to take shape. Today, researchers study leadership the same way that they study other aspects of psychology: they seek to get a better understanding of people\u0027s behavior and motivation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem with some of these theories is that they tend to contradict instead of complement each other. They seek to identify one set of rules or behaviors that turns someone into a leader. The reality is likely a combination of all the theories and some ideas that have yet to be defined. It is best to study these theories with an open mind and understand that they each have their own merits. Remember that emphasis should not be placed on any one theory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChange Management and Decision-Making\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe most difficult task for a manager is implementing changes without disrupting the whole business. Changes to the normal business operation will have supporters and protesters. It is important for a manager to understand the point of views from both sides. Sometimes the changes are minor, such as a new benefits plan. Other times major changes must be made, such as moving the operations across the country and laying off employees. The only certainty with change is that you cannot please everyone, but a good manager will anticipate reactions and focus on effective communication.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth major and minor changes are often the result of a decision-making process. There are many different ways to approach a decision, and each method has an appropriate time and place. Decisions can be based on dictatorial edicts, on a leader\u0027s decision derived from consultation with subordinates, or on a more collective process where everyone can develop and agree on the final outcome. These methods will be presented in this unit. In addition, one must also address the real probability that decisions, regardless of the process by which they are derived, will be clouded by any of a number of biases. We also present the most critical of those biases, including anchoring, groupthink, and selective perception, in this unit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELeading Without Formal Authority\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile many students of this course will go on to manage teams, organizations, and companies, everyone will have opportunities to lead without being granted any actual authority (called \u0022legitimate power\u0022). To leverage these opportunities, you must know what types of power exist and when to use them. For example, having expert power allows someone to step-up, because they have the most knowledge about a specific subject.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELeading without authority goes beyond power; the ability to influence without manipulation, emotional intelligence, and interpersonal skills are all important aspects of gaining power and leadership without having direct authority over a group or team. After studying these topics, you will be able to recognize when a leader takes over a situation and to determine who may be the best leader for a given situation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EManaging Groups and Teams\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhether your power base is legitimate or otherwise, you may find yourself potentially in a leadership position within a group or team. But what is the difference between a group and a team? This was touched on in the first unit, but further distinction is needed here. Groups are often formed organically. Think about a group of car enthusiasts: they come together because of a similar interest. There may not be an underlying goal other than to share ideas and discuss topics of mutual interest. Teams are formed more strategically. For example, think about a professional sports team; management carefully selects and trains players, and together they work toward the common goal of winning games.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETeams should function in the way a group does: with a more relaxed atmosphere, which will allow each contributor to feel comfortable in his or her role. Maintaining this atmosphere can be difficult, because teams sometimes work in very stressful environments. This is why building a good team with great dynamics is so important and so challenging. A team that functions well together will be more productive than a team that does not have a good dynamic. Thus, this unit will enable you to explore the world of teams and groups. You will learn about the internal processes that underlie team/group formation and maintenance as well as the role of leadership in these types of settings. The unit opens with a discussion of diversity.

Exploring this topic is as challenging as it is interesting. But while there may exist many depictions and images on temples and tomb walls that describe in detail the pharaonic home and kitchen, as well as the kinds of foods offered on almost all occasions from the dawn of the Predynastic era, the ancient Egyptians did not leave behind any recipes.

Very early on in the project it quickly became apparent that cooking methods in Upper Egypt and Nubia\u2014regions that have always been strongly insular, adhering closely to ancient cultures and inherited traditions\u2014have retained a pharaonic influence in their simplicity, their tendency to use few ingredients and spices, and their preference for vegetables, grains, spices, and herbs indigenous to the region. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Es noted earlier, the ancient Egyptians left few if any recipes, so the ingredients in this course have been slightly modified to suit modern tastes.

Food sources were diverse, and ancient Egyptians made good use of the different kinds of fish, vegetables, poultry, and fruits. The staple diet of most Egyptians consisted of bread and beer in addition to what produce the land yielded, such as onions, garlic, lentils, leeks, turnips, radish, lettuce, and cucumbers. Since the Predynastic period, ancient Egyptians, rich or poor, consumed various breads made from different grains.

The ancient Egyptians also used a fair share of legumes such as beans, chickpeas, and lentils as well as vegetables such as peas, lettuce, garlic, onions, and leeks.

Ancient Egyptians were easily satisfied with a few loaves of bread, a share of beer, some leeks, and onions. The numerous tomb reliefs that picture the many pleasures of food and drink were probably more indicative of the lives of the upper strata of society, like the higher civil servants, priests, landowners, and nobles. The masses would wait for feasts and special occasions for an excuse to indulge. They likely did not have to wait long as festivals were numerous, judging by the annual special occasions relating to the seasons, the Nile, sowing, harvesting, as well as coronations and funerals \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFood and the Gods\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ancient Egyptians identified spiritually with the forces of nature surrounding them, including the sun, moon, wind, the inundation of the Nile, the strength of fierce animals like lions, snakes, and crocodiles, or powerful animals that were of use to them like cows and bulls. There were many gods, one for each invisible force behind the phenomenon, thus becoming intertwined with the lives of the ancient Egyptians. They did not only worship tangible powers, but also less tangible ones symbolized by animals. For example, the force of wisdom was symbolized by the ibis of Thoth, and fertility by the bull.26 The deification of animals made them a symbol for a certain god or power, but it did not stop the ancients from using them for food, transport, or other purposes. Thus the cow was used for farming, and though the ancient Egyptians deified the crocodile, they didn\u2019t find anything \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Efood and language\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe hieroglyphs used by the ancients were numerous and pictorial: symbols of people, animals, tools and implements, as well as food items. The foods were not chosen randomly, but in fact were built on the importance of that symbol to the lives of the ancient Egyptians. Among the twenty-four letters of the ancient Egyptian alphabet, four are related to food: I was represented by a leaf of a plant. N was represented by water, the source of life. W was represented by a baby quail, one of the birds that were hunted. Quails are also migratory birds and so may have had special significance in certain times of the year.
