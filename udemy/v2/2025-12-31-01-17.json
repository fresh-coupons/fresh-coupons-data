You gain practical experience designing agents that are reliable, explainable, and measurable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA major focus of the course is knowledge-driven and data-aware agents. You build retrieval-augmented agents, integrate structured and unstructured data sources, work with documents, and design long-term memory systems that persist and evolve over time. You also explore advanced capabilities such as multi-modal agents that reason across text, images, and audio, as well as real-time and event-driven agents that respond dynamically to changing inputs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe course then shifts into enterprise-grade agent systems. You learn how to secure agents, prevent prompt injection, enforce governance, and design human-in-the-loop workflows. Topics such as observability, monitoring, versioning, scaling, and cost optimization prepare you to deploy agents in production environments. Ethical considerations and responsible AI practices are woven throughout, ensuring agents are safe, transparent, and aligned with organizational policies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the final phase, you apply agentic AI across real business domains including HR, finance, sales, IT operations, compliance, research, and personal productivity.
