Management of innovations refers to the strategic planning, implementation, and oversight of processes and practices aimed at fostering innovation within an organization. It involves the systematic handling of new ideas, technologies, products, or processes from conception to implementation, with the goal of driving growth, competitiveness, and long-term success.  Key components of managing innovations include:  Strategic Planning: Effective management of innovations begins with strategic planning that aligns innovation efforts with the overall goals and objectives of the organization. This involves identifying areas for innovation, setting clear objectives, and allocating resources strategically.  Idea Generation and Screening: The management of innovations involves generating ideas for new products, services, or processes through brainstorming sessions, market research, or collaboration with stakeholders. These ideas are then screened and evaluated based on criteria such as feasibility, market potential, and alignment with organizational goals.  Resource Allocation: Allocating resources, including financial, human, and technological resources, is a critical aspect of managing innovations. This involves making decisions about how to allocate resources effectively to support innovation initiatives while balancing competing priorities.  Risk Management: Innovation inherently involves risks, including financial risks, technical risks, and market risks. Effective management of innovations requires identifying and assessing these risks and implementing strategies to mitigate them. This may involve conducting risk assessments, scenario planning, or developing contingency plans.  Cross-functional Collaboration: Managing innovations often requires collaboration across different departments or functional areas within an organization. Cross-functional teams bring together diverse perspectives and expertise to tackle complex innovation challenges and drive implementation.","Prototyping and Testing: Before bringing a new product or service to market, it\u0027s essential to prototype and test ideas to gather feedback and identify potential issues.
