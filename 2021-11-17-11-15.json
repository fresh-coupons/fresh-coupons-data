Indeed, since this is a new science there is a few places where you can find a quality introduction course about this topic. Indeed, usually all the course are either to advanced or simply does not cover properly the topic of quantum computing. But, this course is designed to give you all the basic knowledge about the topic. If you :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Are a student and want to learn about new technologies\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Are interested about this topic but don\u0027t know were to find good resources about it\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Want to know how to work with different tools used for quantum computing\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Simply curious about the topic and you want to learn more about it\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen this course is definitely for you and you will love it. Not only you will learn different theoretical concepts that are really useful in quantum computing but you will also use different tools to practice everything that you have learned. Finally, you will not only have an introduction to the topic but also to Microsoft Q the programming language used for quantum computing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe structure of the course\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way this course is designed will help learn all the concepts that you need to be able to understand the basics of Quantum Computing. Indeed, you will at first learn all the basics of mathematics especially linear algebra. Once again, you will not become a specialist in this field but you will at least understand the basic concepts of it that can be useful for your understanding of quantum computing. Then, you will learn what exactly is an algorithm and what is the difference between a quantum algorithm and a classical mathematical algorithm. Also, we are going to cover different quantum algorithms that are also really popular in this field. Finally, you will have an introduction to Microsoft Q. In my opinion this is pretty important to learn because this is the programming language that is used to perform different quantum calculations as well as testing or running different quantum apps. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, it\u0027s really important to understand that I created this course on the Principe of learning by practice. This is why even if this course is mostly theoretical, I\u0026nbsp;tried to implement as much practice as possible. This way, when you will have completed this course you will not only be able to understand the basics of what is quantum computing but you will also be able to write basic lines of code and have a basic understanding of different quantum algorithms.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFor who is this course designed\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis course is created for beginners who have no prior knowledge of what is quantum computing and are interested by the topic.

Lastly we learn how to save and restore models.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am pretty confident that the course will give you the necessary knowledge and skills related to time series forecasting, time series analysis and Python time series techniques to immediately see practical benefits in your work place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGo ahead and click the enroll button, and I\u0027ll see you in lesson 1 of this course on time series forecasting, time series analysis and Python time series techniques!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECheers\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EStart-Tech Academy\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","language":"\u0130ngilizce","courseUri":"https://www.udemy.com/course/machine-learning-time-series-forecasting-in-python/","imageUri":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2859872_aeeb_2.jpg","duration":"13,5 saat","enrolledStudentsCount":"119.237 \u00F6\u011Frenci","lastUpdated":"Son g\u00FCncelleme tarihi: 11/2021","targetAudiences":["People pursuing a career in data science","Working Professionals beginning their Machine Learning journey","Statisticians needing more practical experience","Anyone curious to master Time Series Analysis using Python in short span of time"],"tags":["Yaz\u0131l\u0131m Geli\u015Ftirme","Veri Bilimi","Zaman Serisi Analizi"],"rating":{"count":931,"averageValue":"4.4"},"instructors":[{"name":"Start-Tech Academy","url":"/user/start-tech-academy/","totalNumberOfStudents":1358976,"totalNumberOfReviews":57481,"averageRating":4.457225367377552}]},"isAlreadyAFreeCourse":false,"couponData":{"couponCode":"F2F089","originalPrice":"1.920\u00A0\u20B9","discountedPrice":"\u00DCcretsiz","expirationText":"2 g\u00FCn","discountPercentage":100}},"https://www.udemy.com/course/galatians-living-by-grace/":{"courseDetails":{"courseId":4359092,"title":"Galatians: Living By Grace","shortDescription":"An Expository Message","longDescription":"\u003Cp\u003EThis is a Bible course covering the vital New Testament book of Galatians. The apostle Paul wrote this letter to address issues in the churches of Galatia. Law versus grace is the grand theme. Living by grace is the apostle\u0027s conclusion.

Over six hours of instruction is included in this course. Each video covers about a half chapter of the letter. How does grace relate to salvation? How does grace relate to our sanctification? These critical subjects are addressed to the Galatian Christians. These same subjects are relevant for us today. Everyday practical living is the expected outcome of this letter.

Menu items are explored and explained. Alternative routes to doing the same actions are also explained. Examples are worked through at a very good pace and the videos are not overwhelming. There is no homework, which means that you can actually focus on soaking in the material. Feel free to stop, edit your own confluence and explore, without the pressure of an assignment behind it. I thought everything in the video was helpful and even learned a couple new tricks on how to structure my spaces. There are a variety of use-case scenarios that give you an idea of how to use this tool in different ways (which happens to be my favorite part). Useful demonstrations on layouts, permissions, status changes, drop down menus and more. Confluence is a Canvass that can be used as a great communication platform.
