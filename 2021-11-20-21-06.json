That means you probably can\u2019t\u0026nbsp;leave the house and work outdoors in case you lose your internet\u0026nbsp;connection. And it means you can decide to stop working for the day and\u0026nbsp;visit a friend instead.

You\u2019ll get to experience a lot of the satisfaction that comes from running your own business. And you get\u0026nbsp;passive income, meaning that you\u2019ll earn money while you sleep.\u0026nbsp;But even this isn\u2019t perfect.

What\u2019s more, is that it takes actually a huge amount of time\u0026nbsp;to build up the amount of traffic that you need to make a big profit from a\u0026nbsp;blog. This is especially true if you are planning to use pay-per-click\u0026nbsp;advertising but it\u2019s equally the case if you are selling your own product.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThink about it: how often do you click ads on other websites? This is why it\u0026nbsp;typically takes 1K visitors for you to generate just one or two clicks and the\u0026nbsp;same goes for sales of products. It\u2019s a huge amount of work before you\u0026nbsp;start earning anything and there\u2019s no guarantee it will ever get to the point\u0026nbsp;where it can provide a livable salary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnter: Recurring, Passive Income\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is where membership site come in and offer an incredibly appealing alternative. Essentially, a membership website is a site that users pay to subscribe to. This normally works by first enticing the reader with some free content and showing them the kind of entertainment/information/value that you\u2019re capable of providing. Once they\u2019re hooked, you then make sure they know that they need to subscribe in order to gain access to your very best content and to get frequently updated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what\u2019s so different about this? Well for starters, it means that you can\u0026nbsp;much more easily convert visitors to paying customers seeing as they\u2019re\u0026nbsp;not having to put down a large amount of money and seeing as they know\u0026nbsp;what they\u2019re getting right away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore importantly, though, it means that the money is recurring and much\u0026nbsp;more predictable. Unlike a regular blog that can very much fluctuate,\u0026nbsp;having subscribers means you probably have some kind of agreement or\u0026nbsp;standing order set up. This means that you can practically guarantee that\u0026nbsp;you\u2019ll be able to earn a set amount of money each week, month or quarter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that very quickly starts to add up\u2026\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo say you currently have people subscribing for $5 membership a month.

But it\u2019s very possible the very first person who visits\u0026nbsp;might sign up! There\u2019s an element of luck but as soon as you get that first\u0026nbsp;membership you\u2019re in business \u2013 and $5 membership a month quickly adds up to $60 a\u0026nbsp;year.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEventually, you can work whenever you like and add as much content as\u0026nbsp;you like (we\u2019ll look at how later on) and\u0026nbsp;still know for sure that you\u2019ll be able\u0026nbsp;to earn X amount of money per month and per year.

Below are some reasons why you should learn Machine learning in R\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\t1. It\u2019s a popular language for Machine Learning at top tech firms. Almost all of them hire data scientists who use R. Facebook, for example, uses R to do behavioral analysis with user post data. Google uses R to assess ad effectiveness and make economic forecasts. And by the way, it\u2019s not just tech firms: R is in use at analysis and consulting firms, banks and other financial institutions, academic institutions and research labs, and pretty much everywhere else data needs analyzing and visualizing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\t2. Learning the data science basics is arguably easier in R. R has a big advantage: it was designed specifically with data manipulation and analysis in mind. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\t3. Amazing packages that make your life easier. Because R was designed with statistical analysis in mind, it has a fantastic ecosystem of packages and other resources that are great for data science. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\t4. Robust, growing community of data scientists and statisticians. As the field of data science has exploded, R has exploded with it, becoming one of the fastest-growing languages in the world (as measured by StackOverflow). That means it\u2019s easy to find answers to questions and community guidance as you work your way through projects in R.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\t5. Put another tool in your toolkit. No one language is going to be the right tool for every job. Adding R to your repertoire will make some projects easier \u2013 and of course, it\u2019ll also make you a more flexible and marketable employee when you\u2019re looking for jobs in data science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat is the difference between Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPut simply, machine learning and data mining use the same algorithms and techniques as data mining, except the kinds of predictions vary. While data mining discovers previously unknown patterns and knowledge, machine learning reproduces known patterns and knowledge\u2014and further automatically applies that information to data, decision-making, and actions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDeep learning, on the other hand, uses advanced computing power and special types of neural networks and applies them to large amounts of data to learn, understand, and identify complicated patterns.

A varnam is traditionally performed as an opening item by musicians in Carnatic music concerts to act as warm-up for the musicians,or as a centre main piece in Bharatanatyam dance concerts. As a foundation to Carnatic music,varnams are also practised as vocal exercises by performers of Carnatic music, to help develop voice culture, and maintain proper pitch and control of rhythm. The melodic patterns in a varnam are considered to be characteristic patterns of a particular raga.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETypes of varnams\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENamed for its tanam-like rhythmic qualities, \u003Cem\u003Etana varnams\u003C/em\u003E only have lyrics for the pallavi, anupallavi and charanam.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith rhythmic elements like a padam, \u003Cem\u003Epada varnams\u003C/em\u003E are generally sung to accompany South Indian classical dance, including bharatanatyam.Unlike the \u003Cem\u003Etana varnam\u003C/em\u003E which only has lyrics for the pallavi, anupallavi and charanam and swaras for the rest of the sections a \u003Cem\u003Epada varnam\u003C/em\u003E also have lyrics that correspond to the muktaayi and chitta swaras of the varnam, so generally, \u003Cem\u003Epada varnams\u003C/em\u003E contain more lyrical content than a \u003Cem\u003Etana varnam\u003C/em\u003E.The swaras in this type of varnam are suitable for intricate footwork.\u003Cem\u003EPadajathi varnams\u003C/em\u003E are simply \u003Cem\u003Epada varnams\u003C/em\u003E that also contain jatis in it, making it again more suitable for South Indian classical dance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EContents of a varnam\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe name \u0022varnam\u0022 (meaning \u0022letter\u0022) was likely given to this form of song due to the prevalence of swara letters in this type of composition.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELyrical content of varnams are commonly either devotional or amorous.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe varnam is subdivided into several sections:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPallavi\u003C/strong\u003E: The first section of the Varnam, sung with lyrics or sahitya.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAnupallavi\u003C/strong\u003E: A sort of recapitulation, sung with lyrics or sahitya also.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMuktaayi\u003C/strong\u003E: Sung completely with syllables\u2014or swaras -- (like \u003Cem\u003Es (sa) r (Ri) g(ga) m(ma) p (pa) d(da) n(ni) (sa)(This is the higher version of the normal one\u003C/em\u003E).

Some varnams have this additional part that follows the charanam and chitta(Ettugadda) swaras, that is sung with lyrics or sahitya thus leading back to the muktaayi(Chitta) swara or the first pallavi line itself. It is found more often with very old Varnams and it is less prevalent in the newer varnams. In modern times, some old varnams are even sung partially, by omitting the anubandham part. The most classical example of this is the Viribhoni varnam in Bhairavi, which is sung after omitting one of its chitta swaras and the anubandham.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVarnams are traditionally rendered in a format that consists of Pallavi, Anupallavi and Chitta Swaram (Mukthayi Swaram) being sung first in a relatively slow pace and repeated immediately after in double the speed. The rest of the composition (Charanam onwards) is sung in a \u0027madhyama kala\u0027 or approximately 1.5 times the speed used at the start. Each swara passage is sung, followed by the lyrics of the charanam.
