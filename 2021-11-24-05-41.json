Or does your child\u2019s fantasy play seem to consist only of repetitive movements which has no story to them? I am sure yo are aware of such situation\u2026 Now-a-days children are no longer as creative as they once were.\u0026nbsp; We live in an era obsessed with numbers, data, and test scores, especially as they apply to our kids and their education.\u0026nbsp; Seeing the decline in creativity should make us concerned about our children\u2019s capacities to innovate, problem-solve, and navigate new and unfamiliar situations. \u0026nbsp;\n\n\u0026nbsp; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the world of child development you may hear the phrases like \u201Ccritical thinking skills\u201D and \u201Ccreative problem-solving abilities\u201D when referring to goals for your child\u2019s cognitive development. What we are really talking about is\u2026 imagination. The way to create human beings with imagination is to provide them with opportunities to develop it for themselves when they are very young. These opportunities are found in one place and one place only\u2026 that is, play. Playing with paints, playing with play dough, with costumes, with glue and with crayons. Making a mess. Exploring the woods. Splashing in a puddle. Wondering at a caterpillar you notice inching by you. Pretending to be a bird, gliding through the sky. All these involves great deal of imagination and developing their creative skills to many fold.\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, as parents we must first learn the process of creative learning which we can offer to our kids. We parents should make ourselves aware of the different aspects of creative learning and critical thinking skills so that we can create an environment for our children to flourish in that environment. \n\n\u0026nbsp; In this course, we are going to discuss in details the step-by-step process which you can walk your children through to make them a creative learner and achiever. We have included many exercises and divided the course into 8 sections, each section focusing on the different aspects of creative learning for your child.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIn this course, we will help you understand the child\u2019s psychology and you can help them in their creative journey.
